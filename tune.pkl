aVEquipment service management and rental (ESM&R) refers to equipment services management throughout the heavy equipment life cycle. Increased competition and slim margins in heavy equipment sales and rental place a heavy burden on manufacturers, dealers, rental companies and service businesses to improve their service performance. Improving service in these conditions is critical to maintaining margins and growing profitability.\u000aThe ESM&R approach provides an integrated view of the heavy equipment business. Thus manufacturers, dealers, suppliers, rental and services business can improve the value their customers derive from their equipment and subsequently improve their own profitability and reduce cost at the same time. Collaboration is a critical factor in the equipment supply chain. \u000aEquipment companies must have two fundamentals in place of operational control of service operations on the one hand and equipment intelligence on the other. (1) This enables companies to move to proactive service approaches and make better business decisions. To instill these two fundamentals, service organizations are adopting equipment service management processes and tools.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Heavy equipment life-cycle ==\u000aThe ESM&R approach directly links to the concept of the equipment life-cycle which demands continuous control and a historical record \u2013 from the initial forecasting and sale of the equipment, through to shipping, renting, servicing, overhaul and final disposal. Thus heavy equipment, just like any product life-cycle has its own life-cycle. The main stages of the heavy equipment life-cycle are:\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a"Asset Management Excellence: Optimizing Equipment Life-cycle Decisions" by Normand Champigny, Andrew K.S.

aVDrobnjaci (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0414\u0440\u043e\u0431\u045a\u0430\u0446\u0438, pronounced [dro\u031eb\u0272\u01ce\u02d0t\u0361si]) is a historical tribe and region, Drobnjak, in Old Herzegovina in Montenegro (municipalities from Nik\u0161i\u0107 to \u0160avnik, \u017dabljak and Pljevlja). Its unofficial centre is in \u0160avnik. Today Drobnjaci families are predominantly Orthodox, with a majority declaring as montenegrins. The Orthodox families have St. George (\u0110ur\u0111evdan) as their patron saint (slava) and the majority of Drobnjak churches are devoted to St. George as well. Families of distant Drobnjak origin are present in all former Yugoslav republics and in Hungary and Hungarian populated parts of Romania and Slovakia where it is spelled in its magyarised form as Drobnyák.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Origin and early history ===\u000aAccording to Serbian historian Andrija Luburi\u0107 (1930), by oral tradition their origin was from Travnik in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and initially were called as Novljani. First mention of the name was in 1285 Ragusan document, where was mentioned Vlach Bratinja Drobnjak. The surname probably derives from tribal or regional name.\u000aThe tribal name Drobnjaci (Drobignaçich, Drobgnach, Droggnaz, Dropgnach,Drupinach, Idobrignach) in Herzegovina can be followed from 14th century Ragusan sources; Dragossius Costadinich vlachus Drobignaçich (1365), Goitan Banilouich et Bogosclauus Dessiminich vlacchi de chatono de Dobrgnaçi (1376), Vulchota filius Dobroslaui Drobgnach (1377), Dubraueç Chostadinich et Jurech Bogutouich Drobnachi (1377), and so on. Throughout 14th and 15th century they are specifically mentioned as katun "Vlachs" or "Morlachs". They inhabited lands around Jezera, Prijepolje (1423), Bijela (1443). Some individual examples - Milcien Clapcich, Vlachus de Drobnach in 1390 committed to pay 12 perpers to Jakov Gunduli\u0107 and Pribil Mirkovi\u0107 for one horse which was sequestered in Jezera; Vlach Radivoje Vuk\u0161i\u0107 from Drobnjaci, the head of a caravan, in 1423 was accused in Ragusa for robery of an Italian and had to pay 40 perpers; certain Vlachus Drobnach sequestered 3 rams in Jezera from a Ragusan; in 1454 kidnapped some escorts, similarly in 1456 kidnapped certain Ragusan young man who was sold to the Turks. In Herzegovina they served lords Sandalj Hrani\u0107 Kosa\u010da and Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da.\u000aTribe's first mention in the documents from Bay of Kotor are from the very end of 14th century. In the second half of 15th and 16th century there is no mention. In concern mostly are personal values and silverware, as well lead. They were not mentioned as Vlachs, beside Radmanus Pethcovich de Drobgnacis Vlachus in 1443, and certain morlachus money in concern of some necklace made in "sclavorum" way.\u000aThe oral tradition recorded by Luburi\u0107 (1930) of the tribe in Montenegro preserved stories about fierce conflicts with the native tribe Kri\u010di. In the first Kri\u010di won, and to make peace Kri\u010di voivode Kalok married daughter of knez Kosori\u0107. However, after several years Drobnjaci generated another conflict and along Onogo\u0161tan people, Ri\u0111ani and Banjani defeated them. Kri\u010di reunited at Fo\u010da and attacked Drobnjaci, but again were defeated, and moved over the Tara river. The tradition that on the lands of Drobnjaci started the war against the Greeks probably is reminiscence of the Prince Stefan Vojislav against the Byzantine Empire.\u000aIn the defter of 1477, the Drobnjak had 636 households. In the defter was mentioned katun by voivode Herak Kova\u010dev in nahija Komarnica.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 16th century ===\u000aBrotherhoods began to be formed in Drobnjak only in the beginning of the 16th century.\u000aIn 1538, an Ottoman official in Bosnia, Husret Bey, attacked Drobnjak. He attacked again in 1541, in a battle in Mokro in which his forces were destroyed and he lost his life. Husret Bey is in fact historical figure of Gazi-Husrev Beg \u000aIn the late 16th century, Serbian monks Damjan and Pavle of Mile\u0161eva sent a letter to the Pope, explaining "what is Serbia", among dozens of clan territories, Drobnjaci were also mentioned among other old katuns.\u000aThe burning of Saint Sava's remains after the Banat Uprising (1594) provoked the Serbs in other regions to revolt against the Ottomans. Fights also broke out from Bar to Ulcinj, and in Bjelopavli\u0107i. In 1596, an uprising broke out in Bjelopavli\u0107i, then spread to Drobnjaci, Nik\u0161i\u0107, Piva and Gacko (see Serb Uprising of 1596\u201397). It was suppressed due to lack of foreign support.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 17th and 18th centuries ===\u000aOn \u0110ur\u0111evdan 1605 the Drobnjaci defeated Ottomans in Bukovica, however, the same year they were forced to accept Ottoman rule. Drobnjak vojvoda Ivan Kalu\u0111erovi\u0107 was forced to the Ottomans in Pljevlja, where he was murdered by Tataran-pa\u0161a. According to folklore all Drobnjak families symbolically became pobratim (blood brothers) and adopted \u0110ur\u0111evdan as their slava and most important feast day after defeating the Ottomans. In 1620, the knez of Drobnjaci, Sekula Cerovi\u0107, participated in the assembly of Serb chieftains in Belgrade, regarding liberation actions in which he would take an important role.\u000aThe Drobnjaci, as other tribes of Montenegro, Brda, and Eastern Herzegovina, joined Venice in the Cretan War. Drobnjak vojvoda Pavle Abazovi\u0107 fell in Piva in 1646, in a battle which is said to have taken three hundred Drobnjak lives. In 1649, knez Ilija Baloti\u0107 with the Drobnjaci and other Herzegovinian tribes took over Risak and handed it over to Venice. In 1658 Herzegovinian chieftains requested that the Venetians dispatch to them as soon as possible. In 1662, the sanjak-bey of Herzegovina called 57 chieftains from Nik\u0161i\u0107, Piva, Drobnjak and Mora\u010da, to come to Kola\u0161in, where he killed them all, on the Grand Vizier's order due to cooperation with Venice. It is believed that during the Cretan War, in which the Drobnjaci supported Venice against the Ottomans, and the partially Islamized Kri\u010di supported the Ottomans, the two tribes came into conflict. The Drobnjaci defeated the Kri\u010di, and killed their vojvoda, and pushed them from the left to the right side of the Tara. The Drobnjaci now held Jezera. In 1664 Evliya Çelebi recounted that Sohrab Mehmed Pasha attacked nahija Drobnjaci, and although they captured a lot of people, Drobnjaci killed over 100 Pasha's soldiers.\u000aThe Vulovi\u0107i, \u0110ur\u0111i\u0107i, Kosori\u0107i, Tomi\u0107i and Cerovi\u0107i settled in the Drobnjak county in the 17th century, originally from Banjani. In 1694, Serb Uskoks, driven out by the Turks from Albania, settled in Drobnjak county.\u000aAccording to folkore the Drobnjak vojvoda Stani\u0161a went to the Pasha of Scutari, Mahmud Pasha, and received the voivodeship of the Sanjak of Herzegovina and the alaj-barjak of Herzegovina for the Drobnjak tribe, in ca. 1778. In the 1780s he was murdered by the Ottomans after being deemed uncertain and unreliable to Ottoman rule.\u000aIn 1789, Ivan Radonji\u0107, the governor of Montenegro, wrote for the second time to the Empress of Russia: "Now, all of us Serbs from Montenegro, Herzegovina, Banjani, Drobnjaci, Ku\u010di, Piperi, Bjelopavli\u0107i, Zeta, Klimenti, Vasojevi\u0107i, Bratono\u017ei\u0107i, Pe\u0107, Kosovo, Prizren, Arbania, Macedonia belong to your Excellency and pray that you, as our kind mother, send over Prince Sofronije Jugovi\u0107."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 19th century ===\u000aAfter Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107 was chosen as leader of the uprising in the Smederevo Sanjak (1804), smaller uprisings also broke out in Drobnjaci (1805), Rovca and Mora\u010da.\u000aUnder Prince Nicholas I of Montenegro and the Congress of Berlin recognition (1878), the Montenegrin tribes,since serbs dont have tribes, of Piva, Banjani, Niksici, Saranci, Drobnjaci and a large number of the Rudinjani formed the Old Herzegovina region of the new Montenegrin state.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Conflict with the \u010cengi\u0107 lords ====\u000aSmail-aga \u010cengi\u0107, an Ottoman feudal lord, fought frequently with the Drobnjaci clan, and in letters of Njego\u0161 in 1839 it is known that Rustem-Aga, the son of Smail, had often raped local women of the Drobnjaci and Pivljani. The Drobnjaci had enough of the violations of their women, and approached Petar II Njego\u0161 (who had lost eight family members in the Battle of Grahovo), organizing a plot against the Ottoman lords, planning to first kill Smail. The main conspirators were Novica Cerovi\u0107 and \u0110oko Malovi\u0107. Podmalinsko Monastery was gathering place for members of Drobnjaci tribe who traditionally held meetings there, last time in 1840 to decide to kill Smail-aga \u010cengi\u0107. They started by asking Smail to collect the taxes himself, and in September 1840 the Aga is putting up his tent at Mljeti\u010dak, in eastern Drobnjaci. In the night, the force attacks the camp and Smail and a number of Turks are killed. The circumstances are mentioned in a letter to the Russian consul in Dubrovnik: "The notorious criminal, Smail-aga Cengic, the musselim of Gacko, Pljevlja, Kola\u0161in and Drobnjaci, attacked our frontier regions with several thousand men almost every year. This year too he pitched his tent three hours away from our border, and started collecting troops to invade our tribe of the Mora\u010da. Our men found out about his evil intention earlier, and gathered about 300\u2013400 men, and they attacked his tent on the morning of 23 September, cut down the Aga himself and about 40 of his like-minded criminals... This prominent person was more important in these regions that any of the viziers." The events are richly attested in Serb epic poetry.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 20th century ===\u000aThe Drobnjaci supported the White List at the Podgorica Assembly p. 285\u000aIn 1927, Drobnjaci had 40 settlements of 2,200 houses with 14,000\u201315,000 inhabitants. The capital was \u0160avnik.\u000aOn 1 April 1945, over thirty conspirators were executed in \u0160avnik, of whom a large number were of the Karad\u017ei\u0107i.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Brotherhoods and families ==\u000aIn anthropological studies, the brotherhoods (bratstva) of Drobnjak are divided into either Novljani, Useljenici, Uskoci, and displaced families; or Starinci, Novljani, Useljenici, Uskoci (further divided into \u0160aranci and Uskoci), and emigrant families.\u000aThe Starinci ("natives") who settled prior to the 16th century, today number 57 families, with Mandi\u0107 being the oldest.\u000aThe Novljani, today number 113 families.\u000aThe Useljenici, today number 119 families.\u000aThe Uskoci.\u000aThe \u0160aranci who settled in the second half of the 17th century, today number 44 families.\u000aThe Uskoci, who settled lastly, from the Nik\u0161i\u0107 area, today number 52 families.\u000a\u000aThe most notable brotherhoods (bratstva) of the clan are the Abazovi\u0107, Cerovi\u0107, Karad\u017ei\u0107, Malovi\u0107, \u010cupi\u0107, Kosori\u0107, Jaukovi\u0107 and Zarubica families. The brotherhoods of Vulovi\u0107i, \u0110ur\u0111i\u0107i, Kosori\u0107i, Tomi\u0107i and Cerovi\u0107i, were established when they settled in the Drobnjak from Banjani in the 17th century. The clan was originally formed by five related brotherhoods: Cerovi\u0107, \u0110ur\u0111i\u0107, Kosori\u0107, Tomi\u0107 and Vulovi\u0107 (of whom are the \u017dugi\u0107s). The Drobnjaci are Orthodox in majority, the notably mixed Muslim/Serb family is Kalabi\u0107, the Muslim families are Selimovi\u0107 and D\u017eigal.\u000a\u000aThe Uskoci and \u0160aranci clans are also regarded as part of, or kin to, the Drobnjaci.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notable people ==\u000aPeople from Drobnjaci\u000aNovica Cerovi\u0107 (1805\u20131895), warrior, senator and Drobnjak chief; born in Tu\u0161ina, \u0160avnik.\u000aRadovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 (born 1945), former president of Republika Srpska; born in \u0160avnik area.\u000aTomislav Karad\u017ei\u0107 (born 1939), president of the Serbian Football Association; born in \u0160avnik area.\u000aIgor Zugic (born 1981), Yugoslav born Canadian chessmaster\u000aZoran Laki\u0107 (born 1933), Montenegrin historian and academic\u000aBy ancestry\u000aStojan Cerovi\u0107 (1949-2005), famous Serbian journalist\u000aVanja Buli\u0107 (born 1947), Serbian journalist and author\u000a\u017divojin Mi\u0161i\u0107 (1855\u20131921), general, and participant in all of Serbia's wars from 1876 to 1918, and Chief of the General Staff of Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes 1920\u20131921; great-grandfather from \u017dabljak area.\u000aMladen Milovanovi\u0107 (c. 1760-1823), one of the leaders in the First Serbian Uprising; father fled Tu\u0161ina after a blood feud.\u000aVeselin \u0160ljivan\u010danin (born 1953), Yugoslav officer; born in Pale\u017e, \u017dabljak.\u000aPredrag Drobnjak (born 1975), Montenegrin basketball player; ancestry\u000aAnto Drobnjak (born 1968), former Montenegrin football player\u000aBranislav Drobnjak (born 1961), former Montenegrin football player\u000aDragi\u0161a Drobnjak (born 1977), Slovenian basketball player\u000aFilip Kasalica (born 1988), Serbian-born Montenegrin footballer\u000aDarko Karad\u017ei\u0107 (born 1989), Montenegrin footballer\u000aMiodrag Karad\u017ei\u0107 (born 1987), Montenegrin footballer\u000aMilutin "Mima" Karad\u017ei\u0107, Serbian actor and producer; ancestry\u000aVuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1787\u20131864), Serb linguist, major reformer of the Serbian language; parents from Drobnjaci.\u000aDragomir Brajkovi\u0107 (1947-2009), Montenegrin Serb writer and journalist\u000aMladen Krstaji\u0107 (born 1974), former Serbian football player\u000aDanica Krstaji\u0107 (born 1987) former Montenegrin tennis player\u000aMe\u0161a Selimovi\u0107 (1910-1982), Yugoslav writer\u000aBorislav Peki\u0107 (1930-1992), Serbian political activist and writer\u000aGoran \u017dugi\u0107 (1963-2000), Montenegrin State Security operative, personal aide of Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107; father from \u017dabljak.\u000aMilo\u0161 Cerovi\u0107 (born 1980), former Serbian swimmer\u000aGoran Grbovi\u0107 (born 1961), former Serbian basketball player\u000aNikola Pekovi\u0107 (born 1986), famous Montenegrin basketball player\u000aRade Lon\u010dar (born 1996), Serbian basketball player\u000aMarko Lopu\u0161ina (born 1951), Serbian journalist and publicist\u000a\u017darko Lau\u0161evi\u0107 (born 1960), Serbian and Montenegrin actor\u000aMira\u0161 Dedei\u0107 (born 1938), Head of the uncanonical Montenegrin Orthodox Church\u000aMiladin \u0160obi\u0107 (born 1956), Montenegrin singer and songwriter\u000aUro\u0161 Vemi\u0107 (born 1987), Montenegrin football player\u000aPetar \u010curovi\u0107 (born 1984), Montenegrin volleyball player\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aDrobnja\u010dka me\u0111a, in Banjani, Montenegro\u000aDrobnjaci, in Skopska Crna Gora, Republic of Macedonia\u000aMontenegrin clans\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sources ==\u000aKovijani\u0107, Risto (1974).

aVInkamana High School is in Vryheid, Kwazulu Natal, South Africa. It was started in 1923 and had 200 boarding students in 2009.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aInkana is recognised as a historic school. It is situated in the heart of the Zululand. Inkamana High School was started 2 February 1923 as an intermediate School with only one class of grade 5 by Benedictine Missionaries from the Benedictine Congregation of St. Ottilien in Germany. The school had fifteen pupils, four boys and eleven girls, all from Vryheid and the Paulpietersburg district. They were all boarders at Inkamana. They paid sixpence a month for school fees and brought farm and garden products to pay for their boarding accommodation.\u000aA Roman Catholic Missionary School, was founded in 1918 .\u000aThe first Junior Certificate Examination was held at Inkamana in November 1934. The Senior Certificate course at Inkamana began in 1935 and a year later four pupils were preparing for their graduation. However, three of them left. The only remaining student, Ulrica Dzivane, successfully wrote her Senior Certificate Examination in Nov. 1936. Since then the Senior Certificate results have gained for Inkamana the reputation of being one of the best schools in the country. The failure rate was always low.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Today ==\u000aThe school recorded a hundred percent pass rate in matric examinations from 1969 until now, 2009. Presently the student enrolment is 200 with one class for each grade.\u000aThis co-educational boarding school is part of, and located within, Inkamana Abbey in the Abaqulusi region of KwaZulu Natal Province. There is a monastery, church, farm and other related activities as part of the location.\u000aIn 2007 Inkamana was amongst several schools recognised as "historic schools". Funding of six million rand a year was earmarked for Adams College, Inkamana High School, Ohlange High School, Inanda Seminary and Vryheid Comprehensive High School to make them academies focussing on Maths, Science and Technology. Anglican Archbishop Emeritus Njongonkulu Ndungane has said that they still need funds and "little has been achieved since democracy".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Alumni ==\u000aOswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali, poet\u000aGabriel Ndabandaba, Member of Parliament\u000aZanele Mbeki, former RSA first lady\u000aPrince Gideon Zulu, politician from Zulu Royal family (RIP)\u000aCassius Lubisi, Director-General and Secretary to Cabinet: RSA\u000aDr Malibongwe Mthethwa first black person to own a private hospital in kzn(nongoma private hospital)\u000aThando Zikalala....\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aInkamana High School website

aVSalvin's albatross, or Salvin's mollymawk, Thalassarche salvini, is a large seabird that breeds only in islands in New Zealand's realm. A medium-sized mollymawk in the albatross family, it was long considered to be a subspecies of the shy albatross. It is a medium-sized black and white albatross.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Taxonomy ==\u000aMollymawks are a type of albatross that belong to the family Diomedeidae in the order Procellariiformes, along with shearwaters, fulmars, storm petrels, and diving petrels. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns. Although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the bill, unlike other tubenosed seabirds. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. They produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. Finally, they have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.\u000aThe Salvin's albatross, white-capped albatross, shy albatross and Chatham albatross were all considered the same species until a 1998 article by Robertson and Nunn. Other experts followed suit, with BirdLife International in 2000, Brooke in 2004, ACAP in 2006, and SACC in 2008. Some, however, like James Clements (at the time of his death) didn't agree, nor has Cornell University since (which is responsible for his book). Molecular analysis has shown that it and the closely related Chatham albatross (also considered to be a subspecies of the shy albatross) are sister taxa, and more distantly related to the shy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Etymology ==\u000aThe species was named by Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild for the distinguished ornithologist Osbert Salvin.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description ==\u000a\u000aThe Salvin's albatross is about 90 cm (35 in) and 2.56 m (8.4 ft) across the wings. It weighs 3.3\u20134.9 kg (7.3\u201310.8 lb) and is, alongside the shy albatross, the largest of the mollymawk or small albatross group. The adult bird has a silver-grey crown. Its face, upper throat, and upper mantle are grey, and its back, upperwing, and tail are grey-black. It has a white rump and underparts with a black thumbmark on underwing and black narrow leading and trailing edges on the wing and black wing tips. Its bill is pale grey-green with a pale yellow upper ridge, and a bright yellow tip on the upper mandible, and a dark spot on the tip of the lower mandible. The juveniles have more extensive grey areas and a blue-grey bill with black tips on both mandibles. It can be distinguished from the Chatham albatross by its larger size and grey bill, and from the shy albatross by the greyer head. Such differences can be difficult to pick out at sea, however, and this explains the under-representation of this species in at-sea surveys.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Behavior ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Feeding ===\u000aSalvin's albatross feeds mainly on fish and cephalopods.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Reproduction ===\u000aIt breeds mainly on small rocky islands with little vegetation, and the nest is a pedestal made of mud, feathers, and bird bones. A single egg is laid in September, and incubated by both parents until early November. The chicks fledge after about 4 months.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Range and habitat ==\u000aThe Salvin's albatross breed colonially on three disparate island groups in the Southern Ocean, Île des Pingouins in the Crozet Islands in the Indian Ocean and the Bounty Islands and The Snares to the south of New Zealand, The Pyramid, and Forty-Fours Island. At sea they range from South Africa across to Australia and as far east as the coast of South America.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Conservation ==\u000aThe IUCN classifies this species as vulnerable with longline fisheries and trawlers responsible for small numbers of deaths, although trawlers are responsible for more than half of those killed.The world population is currently estimated to be around 61,500 birds in 1998, which suggests a decline in the species since earlier studies (although differences in methods make direct comparisons difficult). There are 30,750 pairs, in 1998, on the Bounty Islands, compared to 76,000 pairs in 1978. There were 650 pairs on the Snares Islands, and 4 pairs were recorded on Île des Pingouins in the Crozet Islands. Single chicks have been observed on The Pyramid and Forty-fours Island in 2007.\u000aBird banding and studies are underway, and all of the islands except for The Pyramid, and Forty-fours Island, which are privately owned, are nature preserves. In 1998, the Snares Islands and Bounty Islands were declared World Heritage Sites, and in 2006, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission adopted a measure to require bird bycatch mitigation measures south of 30°S.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Footnotes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aSpecies factsheet - BirdLife International\u000aPhotos and fact file - ARKive

aVSaint Mary de Cervellione (de Cervello; Mary of Cervellon) (1230 at Barcelona \u2013 19 September 1290) was a Catalan superior of a Third Order of Mercedarians. She is a Catholic saint; her following, which began immediately after her death, was approved by Pope Innocent XII in 1692.\u000aShe is invoked especially against shipwreck and is generally represented with a ship in her hand. Her feast is celebrated on 25 September. On account of her charity towards the needy she began to be called Maria de Socos (Mary of Help).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aShe was a daughter of a Spanish nobleman named William de Cervellon. One day she heard a sermon preached by Bernard de Corbarie, the superior of the Brotherhood of Our Lady of Ransom at Barcelona, and was so deeply affected by his pleading for the Christian slaves and captives in the hands of the Muslims of Spain and North Africa that she resolved to do all in her power for their alleviation. In 1265 she joined a little community of pious women who lived near the monastery of the Mercedarians and spent their lives in prayer and good works under the direction of Bernard de Corbarie. They obtained permission to constitute a Third Order of Our Lady of Ransom (de Mercede) and to wear the habit of the Brotherhood of Our Lady of Ransom.\u000aIn addition to the usual vows of tertiaries, they promised to pray for the Christian slaves.

aVChampeta is a genre of folk music and dance originating in the Atlantic coastal regions of Colombia.\u000aChampeta originated among inhabitants of African descent of the Colombian cities of Cartagena de Indias and Barranquilla, and was linked with the culture of the Palenque of San Basilio district. It shows influences of musical genres from Euro-African colonial settlements and from the continent of Africa. \u000a\u000a\u000a== Background ==\u000aThe word \u201cchampeta\u201d originally denoted a short, curved knife of the same name, used in the region at work, in the kitchen and as an offensive weapon. The word is first known to have been used as a cultural identifier in the 1920s. It was used to identify a dance in the 1970s and a musical genre in the 1980s.\u000a\u000aSocio-cultural researchers and sociologists have established that at some time before the 1920s the term \u201cchampetudo\u201d started to be applied to residents of the more outlying districts of Cartagena, who tended to be poorer and of African descent. The term was applied by the economic élite with the intention of disparaging this surviving culture, with associations of vulgarity, poverty and blackness. Thus \u201cchampeta\u201d refers to a culture whose history is marked by slavery and mistreatment. At the start of the 1970s Champeta culture became better-known in Colombia due to the development of a set of complex dances set to the rhythms of salsa and jíbaro and later reggae, as well as progressively more foreign or novel dance genres as providers competed for exclusivos, records other groups did not have in their library. This music was played at full volume through big loudspeakers known locally as \u201cpicós\u201d (from the English word \u201cpick-up\u201d) by troupes of the same name. These early dances were called \u201ctherapy\u201d for their relaxing nature, a distraction from the economic problems of the country.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Development of the musical genre ==\u000aAround 1981 \u201ccreole therapy\u201d emerged as a musical genre to be performed and sung. Among its sources of inspiration was recorded music brought into the port of Cartagena from Africa and from other Euro-African settlements. Its first composers were people of African descent from Cartagena and Palenque de San Basilio, later joined by songwriters and entrepreneurs from Barranquilla and other parts of Colombia. It consisted in a fusion of African rhythms (soukous, highlife, mbquanga, juju) with those from the Antilles (ragga, compás haitiano, also influenced by music of Indigenous and Afro-Colombian origins (bullerengue, mapalé, zambapalo and chalupa). This style of music came to be known as \u201cColombian therapy\u201d and finally took on the name of the \u201cchampeta\u201d culture. During the 1990s champeta underwent further changes in its musical and other content, with the introduction of digital techniques and \u201cplacas\u201d (interruptions counter to the rhythm). Despite its social origins, champeta came to be as much appreciated as rejected by the social élite.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Musical content ==\u000aIn champeta music the rhythmic base dominates over the melodic and harmonic lines, producing a music easy to dance to and marked by its strength and plasticity. The instruments used include the voice, percussion, electric guitar, bass, conga drums, and the synthesiser which contributes rhythmic effects. This musical form is characterised by a division into three sequential parts: the introductory music, the chorus, and a third element known as \u201cel Despeluque\u201d, marked by powerful repetitive rhythms and usually accompanied by \u201cplacas\u201d. Song lyrics often display the rebellious attitude of Cartagena people of African descent, challenging social and economic exclusion or relating their dreams of change and progress.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cultural aspects ==\u000a\u000aThe standard conception of champeta includes four central aspects: musical expression, the distinctive language, the loudspeakers (\u201cpicós\u201d), and the \u201cperreos\u201d \u2013 celebrations. Some give equal importance to other aspects such as dance, political activism, costume, or videos. More recently this cultural phenomenon has spread to other art forms such as cinema, literature and the plastic arts.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Performers ==\u000aAbril and Soto (2004) identify as \u201cchampeta stars\u201d those artists who have transcended their local background and signed contracts with big national and international music companies. These include \u201cEl Sayayín\u201d (Jhon Jairo Sayas), \u201cMr. Black El Presidente Del Genero\u201d (Edwin Antequera), \u201cEl Afinaito\u201d (Sergio Liñan), \u201cÁlvaro El Bárbaro\u201d (Álvaro Zapata), \u201cElio Boom\u201d (Francisco Corrales), "El Intelectual" Kevin Florez, Twister El Rey, \u201cYao & Zaa\u201d Viviano Torres, Eddy Jey, among others. Torres joined the first singers of the genre to form the group Anne Swing which achieved international fame at the end of the 1980s, appearing in the United States \u201cTop 40\u201d. More recent performers include \u201cEl Jhonky el profeta\u201d (Jhon Einster Gutíerrez Cassianis), who died in 2005; \u201cEl Michel\u201d who created an anthem-like song about the champeta way of life; Leo Fenix, Karly Way and El Oveja. El Yao, young f, Zaider, Jeivy Dance, King Kayze, Mr Anthony, J Manny, Jeizy Bow, Boby Sierra\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Performers of related genres ===\u000aThe singer Carlos Vives adopted the Terapia-Champeta genre in the song Pa' Maite and shows some of this influence elsewhere.\u000aThe salsa singer Joe Arroyo aiming to highlight what is of African or Indigenous origin in the Caribbean and Cartagena, combines various African musical influences such as champeta, and is described on many of his discs as \u201dchampetuo\u201d, for example La rebelión.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cinema ==\u000aCimarrones al filo de la champeta (2008) produced and directed by Jorge Benítez, was the first film about champeta culture to be based on the everyday life and the stereotype of the \u201cchampetudo\u201d.\u000aLa gorra, made by Andres Lozano Pineda also in 2008.\u000aBandoleros (2006) directed by Erlyn Salgado recognised by the journalist Ricardo Chica and the researcher Rafael Escallón as the first film to display champeta culture. It was filmed using a cellphone and a Handycam camera, and is notable for having been distributed through informal markets, as is normal for Therapy music.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Nightlife ==\u000aIn Colombia there are many night clubs where people can go dancing to the sound of champeta music.\u000aIn Cartagena de Indias, in the Bazurto neighbourhood, there is a place called Bazurto Social Club, next to the Centenario park, were live bands play champeta in the colourful walls that relate to Cartagena's history. Opened from Thursday to Saturday, from 19:00 until 3:00, it's a great place to learn some of the champeta's moves. \u000aIn Bogota, in the zona rosa, there's a bar called Campanario, where a live band plays all the tropical rhythms such as champeta, reggeaton, reggae, and even calypso. Opened from Wednesday to Saturday, from 19:00 until 3:00, it is recommended to be there early because it is a small, popular and quite crowded bar. \u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000aMarion Provenzal, Claudia Mosquera (2000).

aVBeaconhills College is a co-educational, ecumenical, independent school providing education from early learning to prep to year 12. The college has 3 campuses: Little Beacons Learning Centre and the Pakenham Campus located in Pakenham and the Berwick Campus is situated in Berwick, Victoria, Australia.\u000aBeaconhills was established in 1982 by the Anglican and Uniting Churches to serve the education needs of the Christian community in the greater Pakenham area. The College celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2012.\u000a\u000a\u000a== College history ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Inception ===\u000aThe idea to establish a local, independent, Christian school was conceived by a group of parishioners at St. John's Anglican Church in Upper Beaconsfield in 1980. By March 1981 a Steering Committee had been established with Mr John McConchie appointed as Chairperson. The Steering Committee called a public meeting at the Pakenham Hall on 11 March 1981 where the proposal to establish an ecumenical, co-educational, low-fee secondary school was ratified in the presence of some 250 people.\u000aIn 1981, as the Steering Committee continued to hold public meetings seeking support for the new school, a 13-acre (53,000 m2) site on Toomuc Valley Road, Pakenham was purchased and portable classrooms obtained from St. Catherine's School in Toorak, and Mr Frank Millett was appointed as founding principal. On 3 February 1982 Beaconhills Christian College opened with 34 students and five staff. A dedication service was held at St. James Church on 28 March 1982. Mr Frank Millet led the College as principal until 1988 by which time the College community had grown to include 388 students and a teaching staff of 30. Mr John McConchie, having led the Steering Committee, was Chairperson of the Board until 1986.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of schools in Victoria\u000aList of high schools in Victoria\u000aVictorian Certificate of Education\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aBeaconhills College website

aVLynn Ullom (born 17 July 1960) is the West Liberty University former women's basketball program head coach and currently its athletic program director in West Liberty, West Virginia.\u000a\u000a\u000a== High school ==\u000aUllom competed on the basketball and track teams at Cameron High School in Cameron, West Virginia before graduating from Cameron in 1978.\u000a\u000a\u000a== College ==\u000aUllom attended Waynesburg (Pa.) College immediately following high school for one year and then worked for two years before returning to college at West Liberty in 1982. He graduated from West Liberty with a B.A. in Social Science Education in 1985.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early career ==\u000aAfter graduation, Ullom spent two years as a coach and substitute teacher at Cameron High School. He coached boys' basketball (Grades 7-9 and junior varsity) as an assistant coach under former West Liberty University men's basketball head coach Jim Crutchfield.\u000aUllom left Cameron in 1987 to accept a teaching job at Lakeland High School in Freeport, Ohio. He spent his first year at Lakeland as freshman boys' basketball coach before making the transition to girls' basketball as assistant head coach for the next two years. He also served as track head coach at Lakeland for one year.\u000aUllom moved into the college ranks in 1991 when he was hired as head women's basketball coach at West Liberty. Since the women's basketball job was only a part-time position at that time, he continued to teach at Lakeland High School for two more years while making the daily 50-mile drive to the West Liberty campus. This continued until 1993, when his role as head women's basketball coach at West Liberty was combined with the job of Sports Information Director to create a full-time position.\u000aIn addition to his coaching responsibilities, Ullom also served as associate athletic director at West Liberty from 2009-16 before his appointment as co-interim athletic director, along with head football coach Roger Waialae, for the 2015-16 academic year. Ullom stepped down as head women's basketball coach on May 4, 2017 when WLU President Dr. Stephen Greiner announced his appointment as the university's full-time athletic director.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Coaching Career ==\u000aUllom averaged more than 20 wins a season (534-252, .679) during his 26 years as head women's basketball coach at West Liberty. During the 2015-16 season, he became only the 14th coach in the history of NCAA Division II women's basketball to record 500 wins. When he stepped down, Ullom ranked among the top 15 NCAA Division II coaches of all time in career wins and winning percentage. Ullom's West Liberty teams posted 17 20-win seasons, won three West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference and two Mountain East Conference regular-season championships, five WVIAC and two MEC tournament championships and advanced to the conference tournament championship game on 14 different occasions. His Hilltoppers earned 14 NCAA Tournament bids, capped by a run to the 2016 NCAA Division II "Sweet 16" that included a regional tournament victory against defending national champion California (Pa.).\u000aDuring Ullom's tenure, his teams set numerous school records, including wins in a season (29), consecutive wins (15) and points in a game (112) while claiming multiple NCAA team and individual statistical championships. His players also received extensive individual recognition, virtually rewriting the WLU record book and earning 52 first- or second-team All-Conference selections. Every women's basketball player who completed her playing career at West Liberty under Ullom has earned her degree.\u000aA two-time WVIAC Coach of the Year recipient (1996, 2000) and the 2016 MEC Coach of the Year, Ullom was the first head coach of a women's sport to receive the West Virginia College Coach of the Year Award in 2001. He was also honored as the 2011 Region 2 Coach of the Year by the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) and was a 2016 Victory Award Club recipient at the annual WBCA Convention in Indianapolis in recognition of his 500th career coaching win. Ullom passed former West Virginia University coach Kittie Blakemore as the all-time winningest collegiate women's basketball coach in the state of West Virginia during the 2006 season. Blakemore had 301 wins in 19 seasons with the Mountaineers. Ullom was inducted into the West Liberty University Hall of Fame in September 2010.

aVSharon K. "Shari" Sheeley (April 4, 1940 \u2013 May 17, 2002) was an American songwriter, who wrote songs for Glen Campbell, Ricky Nelson, Brenda Lee, and Sheeley's former fiancé, Eddie Cochran.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aSheeley attended Newport Harbor High School in Newport Beach, and briefly worked as a teen model. She went to Hollywood to meet the stars, and write songs. She wrote her first song, "Poor Little Fool", which Ricky Nelson recorded. In 1958 it became Nelson's first US No. 1 and the Billboard Hot 100's first No. 1. At age 18, Sheeley was the youngest woman to write an American number-one hit.\u000aJerry Capehart, the manager and songwriting partner of Eddie Cochran, then agreed to look after Sheeley's interests, and she and Cochran began a relationship. She wrote "Love Again" and "Cherished Memories" for Cochran, and the 1959 hit "Somethin' Else" with Eddie's brother Bob Cochran. Her other songwriting credits included "Hurry Up", recorded by Ritchie Valens.\u000aIn April 1960 she traveled to England to join Cochran and Gene Vincent, who were touring there. She and Cochran were reported as being "unofficially engaged". She recorded a song, "Homework", with producer Jack Good. On the night of April 16, 1960, Sheeley, Vincent, and Cochran were traveling in a private hire taxi from a concert in Bristol to London airport when it blew a tire and slammed into a lamp post near Chippenham, Wiltshire. All three were rushed to hospital. Cochran, who had been thrown from the vehicle, suffered fatal brain injuries and died the next day, at the age of 21. Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis, and Vincent broke his ribs and collarbone and added further damage to his already weak leg.\u000aFollowing the accident she returned to the USA, where she collaborated with musician/songwriter, Jackie DeShannon on a string of hits, including Brenda Lee's "Dum Dum" and "Heart in Hand", The Fleetwoods' "He's The Great Imposter", and Irma Thomas's "Breakaway". She also co-wrote songs with Chris Curtis of The Searchers, including "Night Time" recorded by Paul and Barry Ryan.\u000aIn 1961 she married Los Angeles disc jockey, Jimmy O'Neill. They created the ABC-TV series Shindig! (1964-1966). They divorced five years later, but remained friends. After her divorce, she moved away from the music scene, apart from some public appearances at Cochran conventions in the 1990s. In August 2000, RPM Records released a collection of her songs that were recorded in the early 1960s by session musicians, including Glen Campbell, Delaney Bramlett, Leon Russell, David Gates, Hal Blaine and Herb Alpert.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Death ==\u000aFive days after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage, she died on May 17, 2002, at Sherman Oaks Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles at the age of 62. She is buried at Forrest Lawn Memorial Park, Cypress, California, just a few feet from Eddie Cochran.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Media ==\u000aIn 1988, Levi Strauss & Co. promoted their Levi's 501 range with an advert \u2013 titled "Eddie Cochran" and directed by Syd Macartney \u2013 which told the story of how Sheeley \u2013 played by actress Sharon Devlin \u2013 attracted Cochran at a party by wearing said product. It was seemingly narrated by Sheeley and the background song, "C'mon Everybody", was released as a promotional single, followed by a compilation album of Cochran's hits.

aVPan American Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, on December 21, 1988. 243 passengers, 16 crew members, and 11 people on the ground were killed by the explosion. It was the second most disastrous passenger airline explosion up to that time By the next day, experts found enough evidence to declare the explosion to be deliberate sabotage. Within days intelligence sources reported an anonymous telephone call to the United States embassy in Helsinki, Finland, on December 5, 1988, warned of possible sabotage on the flight.\u000aNewly elected President George H. W. Bush met with victims\u2019 families in April 1989. Relatives present asked for an independent investigation of airline security which, they claimed, should have prevented the disaster. Bush promised he would look into establishing just such a commission. Relatives also complained about the State Department\u2019s poor consular services for assisting victims\u2019 family members. This news seemed to shock the President.\u000aU.S. government personnel were belatedly reported to be deeply involved in the investigation.

aVFrom the Ages is the third full-length studio album by American rock band Earthless. It was released on October 8, 2013 by Tee Pee Records. It had been six years since the band\u2019s last full-length studio album, Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky, as all three members of Earthless were pre-occupied with other matters, including other bands.\u000aThe album comprises four songs, all instrumental, and was recorded in two days. Much of the album\u2019s material had existed in the band\u2019s live repertoire before \u2013 in particular the album's title track had been released in an early form on the band's 2008 live album Live at Roadburn \u2013 and the rest of it was created during the recording sessions and rehearsals. Despite the band's preference for analog tape, the title track had to be recorded digitally to accommodate its length.\u000aThe album was released to mostly positive critical reaction, with criticisms usually directed at the length of the material (and of the title track in particular) amid praises for its composition and depth. A number of publications cited the album as one of the best 2013 releases on year-end lists. Earthless earned two nominations at the San Diego Music Awards, and From the Ages became the band\u2019s second album to win the Best Hard Rock Album award there.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Background and recording ==\u000aEarthless' last studio album, Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky, had come out in 2007, and their live album Live at Roadburn (on which an early version of "From the Ages" was recorded) in 2008; further releases had been delayed since then as members of Earthless were becoming increasingly pre-occupied with other matters. Constant touring in 2008 and 2009 kept the band out of the studio, drummer Mario Rubalcaba began playing with Off! and guitarist Isaiah Mitchell became involved with Howlin' Rain. Mitchell also moved to northern California, which reduced the available time to rehearse with Earthless (who are based in San Diego). After three rehearsals, the band recorded the album in two days, recording much of it live the first day and additional details the following day, in San Francisco with producer Phil Manley in his studio, Lucky Cat Recording.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Song information ==\u000aThe songs on the album began as "very loose, general ideas" according to Rubalcaba, who also said "Violence of the Red Sea" was the most organized, structured song on the album (although he later said the same of the title track). Eginton wrote the bass lines for "Violence of the Red Sea", inspired by funk and "prog-psych" bands from the UK and Europe. The song, which had been included in the band's concert setlist for the last few years prior to recording, was named after the combination of riffs and tempos which "collid[ed] together like an angry sea". The song's finale was present in the band's repertoire for almost a decade and was used to close the song for the tension it created, whereas the opening of the song was considered more of a "laid back groove". After Rubalcaba and Eginton had outlined the song's bass guitar and drum parts in Mitchell's absence (due to now living elsewhere), Mitchell was allowed to improvise lead guitar over them when he was able to play with the duo.\u000a"Uluru Rock" was named after the Uluru rock formation in Australia, as an homage to the country, and was written by Mitchell and Eginton through improvisations while they waited for Rubalcaba to get on stage to begin the band's first show in the country At the time the band had not been to the landmark. As a tribute to the natives, the song was specifically named Uluru as opposed to Ayers Rock, the landmark's other official name. "Uluru Rock" became the opening song on the band's setlist for all shows thereafter.\u000a"Equus October" was born out of a song that the band were considering discarding because they were never able to finish it until they entered the studio and changed their minds, wanting more material on the album. They decided to use a riff from it only as an interlude that ran 30 seconds long, but they came up with more ideas about what to do with it during the mixing process, eventually increasing the length of the song. Rubalcaba explained that the bass guitar line remained a constant fixture on jam sessions between himself and Eginton, and they decided to give it a chance by recording it at the album's sessions. Once Mitchell also began adding material to the song, Rubalcaba felt it started taking on a "strong & majestic yet mournful" sensation, almost as if it were about a ritualistic sacrifice. He later discovered the ritual of the October Horse and based the song's title on that of the ritual. "It took on the feeling I had about the jam & how it just completely comes crashing down so abruptly at the end," he explained. Expanding the song in the studio led the group to want to use it as an interlude that leads into the album's title track.\u000a"From the Ages" was recorded for the band's live album Live at Roadburn five years before and, being very long, was described by Rubalcaba as "a bastard to play [and relearn]". The band wanted to record it in as few takes as possible in spite of its length, which they addressed by recording the song in Pro Tools as they expected it could be up to forty minutes long; in the past they used analog tape which only allowed for about twenty minutes of music but, according to Rubalcaba, yielded the best recording quality. Earthless rehearsed "From the Ages" for three days before recording it in about three takes. In the last five minutes of the song, the band very gently ease into the end, to avoid having to end the song abruptly. Although he had said the same of "Violence of the Red Sea" with respect to the album itself in a previous interview, Rubalcaba later described "From the Ages" as the most organized, planned song the band had yet ever recorded, let alone recorded for this album. He described the mixture of influences in the song as "A supreme psycho-delic buffet served up with all the sour Kraut, all the freshest sushi Japan has to offer & what not". Rubalcaba reiterated the "pre-historic, caveman, dry & mysterious wasteland feel" that inspired the title. The song expanded constantly during rehearsals and evolved after its debut on Live at Roadburn.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Release and reception ==\u000aFrom the Ages was released on October 8, 2013, by Tee Pee Records. The artwork was created by artist Alan Forbes, whose work Rubalcaba commended as "captur[ing] [the phrase "From the Ages"] to a T".\u000aFrom the Ages charted at #25 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart for a week. Critical reaction to the album was largely positive, though the album's length was commonly cited as a minor flaw. Metacritic reported a score of 84 based on five reviews, indicating "Universal acclaim". "Though the silence may have been deafening for their small but devoted cadre of fans, the wait was worth every moment," wrote Erik Highter for PopMatters, who described the chemistry between the band members as "near telepathic connections between the players" and the roles of Eginton and Rubalcaba as "pulling" Mitchell back from potential unrestrained solos. He rated the album 8 out of 10, his only complaint being that listeners may consider the title track too long. Conversely, Grayson Currin of Pitchfork Media said that the rhythm section did not serve to restrain Mitchell at times, but to "instead follow his ecstatic lead everywhere, fellow travelers on his odyssey of enthusiasms". He echoed Highter's opinion with respect to the title track's length, calling it "the one moment [on the album] where the band's patience might test your own" and asked, regarding the length and repetitive nature of the album as a whole, "is there a need for an hour of three dudes tracing and retracing a melody?" The length of "From the Ages" was also criticized by Exclaim! reviewer Trystan MacDonald who cited it as the record's "only flaw" and rated the album overall 8 out of 10.\u000aeMusic contributor Dan Epstein rated the album 4.5 stars out of 5 and described the interaction between band members similarly to Highter and Currin, saying that, while Mitchell's guitar leads are prominent, Eginton and Rubalcaba are "locked-in" with him and each other, "never los[ing] focus or intensity for a second \u2014 not even during the rolling 30-minute title track." In his review for NOW Magazine, John Semley said that while inferior to Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky, the high point was the opening track, "Violence of the Red Sea", and the album is "an essential record for anyone who likes the sound of guitars sounding like guitars". Karen A. Mann also wrote, for the heavy metal section of About.com, that the opening track was the band's peak performance on the album, which she rated 4 out of 5. Rolling Stone referred to the album as one of the 20 best metal albums of 2013, while Magnet named it the third best of the year's top ten hard rock releases. Likewise, the Austin Chronicle ranked it ninth in the top ten metal releases of 2013, and later reviewer Raoul Hernandez gave the album a perfect four-star review. Earthless were again nominated for Best Hard Rock Artist at the 2013 San Diego Music Awards, and the record won the 2014 award for Best Hard Rock Album, becoming the band's second record to do so (their debut Sonic Prayer won the award in 2007).\u000aIn support of the album, Earthless toured the west coast of the United States in October 2013, with the Shrine in Australia from December 2013 to January 2014, and the east coast of the US in August 2014. They also embarked on a tour of Europe that fall. The band had planned a tour of Japan with Eternal Elysium, but were forced to cancel the engagement to tend to ill family members; they rescheduled it for January 2015.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Track listing ==\u000aAll songs written by Earthless.\u000a"Violence of the Red Sea" \u2013 14:46\u000a"Uluru Rock" \u2013 14:08\u000a"Equus October" \u2013 5:42\u000a"From the Ages" \u2013 30:55\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personnel ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Earthless ===\u000aIsaiah Mitchell \u2013 guitar\u000aMike Eginton \u2013 bass guitar\u000aMario Rubalcaba \u2013 drum kit\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Additional personnel ===\u000aCredits taken from the album's liner notes.\u000aPhil Manley \u2013 producer, mixer\u000aIsaiah Mitchell \u2013 mixer\u000aMario Rubalcaba \u2013 mixer\u000aCarl Saff \u2013 mastering\u000aAlan Forbes \u2013 cover art\u000aMike Eginton \u2013 inside art\u000aAke Arndt \u2013 album layout\u000aOperation Mindblow \u2013 liquid overlays\u000a\u000a\u000a== Chart positions ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aFrom the Ages at Discogs\u000aFrom the Ages at MusicBrainz (list of releases)

aVOn 11 April 2017, the tour bus of German football team Borussia Dortmund was attacked with roadside bombs in Dortmund, Germany. Three bombs exploded as the bus ferried the team to the Westfalenstadion for the first leg of their quarter-final against Monaco in the UEFA Champions League. One of the team's players, Marc Bartra, and a policeman were wounded, but the strengthened windows of the bus prevented further casualties.\u000aThe initial line of inquiry assumed that it was an Islamist terrorist attack due to letters found at the scene, which claimed the attack was an act of retaliation for Muslims killed in the German military intervention against Islamic State, and threatened further attacks unless Germany withdraws and the US military base in Ramstein is shut down. However, discrepancies in the evidence eventually led investigators to consider it a false flag attack. Additional claims of responsibility, supposedly from far-left and far-right groups, were also investigated.\u000aOn 21 April 2017, German police arrested a man on suspicion of planting bombs to drive down the Borussia Dortmund share price and profit by put warrants he bought prior to the attack.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bombing ==\u000aThe team bus of Borussia Dortmund was attacked with three homemade pipe bombs while on its way to Westfalenstadion in Dortmund. The bombs were hidden in hedges by the roadside and detonated at around 19:15 local time (17:15 UTC). They were packed with sharp metal pins and had a reach of about 100 meters (109 yards). Based on the type of detonator and explosive involved, German authorities assume "terrorist involvement". The bombs used military detonators and the explosives may have come from military stocks. Spanish footballer and Dortmund's team member Marc Bartra was wounded by shards of glass from the shattered bus window; he was taken to a nearby hospital where his right wrist was immediately operated on, and was forced to miss both legs. A policeman suffered blast injury and shock; he was escorting the bus on a motorcycle.\u000aAt the time, the bus was on its way to the first leg of Borussia Dortmund's 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League quarter-final against Monaco at the Signal Iduna Park; the match was rescheduled for the following day.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Investigation ==\u000aThe German police and state lawyers are treating it as attempted murder and a planned attack on Borussia Dortmund. There were three claims of responsibility: one left at the scene claiming an Islamist motive, one posted on the internet claiming an 'anti-fascist' motive (which was deemed to be fake), and one later sent to a newspaper claiming a far-right motive. The German Federal Prosecutor's Office initially called the attack an act of terrorism with possible Islamist involvement. The Interior Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia called the attack "professional". Police are investigating whether it was an attack by Islamists, by the far-left or by the far-right. According to German media, investigators are also considering whether a foreign security service was behind the bombing.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Claims of responsibility ===\u000aThere were three differing claims of responsibility. The first claim was found in three identical letters left at the scene. The letters said the attack was retaliation for German military intervention against Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria, accusing it of being responsible for killing Muslims. It demanded that the US military base in Ramstein be shut down and the German Tornado jets be withdrawn from Syria. It threatened further attacks on non-Muslim celebrities in Germany unless the demands are met. The letters were seen as unusual, as previous ISIS-linked attacks in Europe did not come with such confessions. Unlike previous video claims of responsibility, the letters directly addressed the German chancellor and had no religious justifications, ISIS logo, or signature. German newspapers later reported that investigators had "significant doubts" over the letters' authenticity, and suggested they may have been written to frame Islamists.\u000aAnother claim was posted on the left-wing, open-publishing website IndyMedia. It said the attack was committed because Borussia Dortmund did not do enough against racists, Nazis, and right-wing populists within its fanbase. The claim was removed as fake, and police also treated it as fake.\u000aA few days later, a third claim of responsibility was sent to the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, which hinted at a far-right motive. The anonymous e-mail praised Adolf Hitler and attacked multiculturalism, adding that the attack was a "last warning". A spokeswoman for the federal prosecutors said the claim was being investigated. The letter also threatened another attack on protesters who plan to demonstrate against the Alternative for Germany party's conference in Cologne in 22 April. Police also considered the possibility that the attack was carried out by the far-right in order to incite backlash against Muslims.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Suspects ===\u000aIn the initial stage of the investigation, the police identified two suspects and arrested one of them. The apartments of both suspects were searched. The arrested suspect was an Iraqi immigrant living in Wuppertal and was suspected of being an Islamist extremist. Police believe he led an ISIS unit in Iraq involved in killings, kidnappings, smuggling, and extortion. However, police later concluded he was not responsible for the Dortmund bombing.\u000aOn 21 April 2017, the federal prosecutor announced that it had arrested a 28-year-old German-Russian citizen, identified only as Sergej W., on suspicion of 20-fold attempted murder, bringing about an illegal detonation of explosives, and aggravated battery. The man had been staying at the Borussia team hotel. He planted explosives along the road where the team bus would later leave to the stadium. During check-in, he chose a room with a window facing the road so he would be able to remotely trigger the explosion when the bus passed by. It was revealed that on the day of the attack, he had bought put warrants for \u20ac78,000 from an investment bank using the internet connection in his hotel room. These would have made him a large profit of up to \u20ac3.9 million if Dortmund's share price were to plummet after a successful attack, but it only dropped by 5% after the attack and later recovered. The unusual transaction raised suspicion of money laundering with bank employees, prompting them to alert authorities and pass to them the identity of Sergej W., which led to his arrest. Police also said Sergej W. left letters at the scene of the crime to frame Muslims for the attack.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Aftermath ==\u000aThe match was postponed until the following day at 18:45 local time (16:45 UTC), which resulted in a 3\u20132 win for Monaco. Both Monaco and Dortmund fans united in friendship after the bombing. Many Dortmund fans, Germans and local hotels offered Monaco fans free food and places to stay for the night. Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel expressed her appalled reaction to the attack. The staff of Borussia Dortmund and former football player Lothar Matthäus criticized the short-term planning of UEFA.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVCroatian Canadians are Canadian citizens who are of Croatian descent. The community exists in major cities including the Greater Toronto Area, Hamilton, Ottawa, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Windsor, and Montreal.\u000aA popular Croatian Canadian event is the Croatian-North American Soccer Tournament.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Demographics ==\u000aThere are approximately 114,880 Canadians of Croatian ethnic origin as reported in the 2011 Census compiled by Statistics Canada. Although predominantly found in Ontario, Croatian Canadians are present in most major Canadian cities throughout the country. The three largest Croatian communities are found in the following cities:\u000aToronto, Ontario: 12,665\u000aHamilton, Ontario: 9,110\u000aMississauga, Ontario: 8,935\u000aThe town with the largest percentage of people of Croatian ethnic origin is Kenaston, Saskatchewan - 17.5% of its 285 inhabitants claim Croatian ethnic origin. Statistics Canada also designates Census Metropolitan Areas in the collection of its data. The ten Census Metropolitan Areas with the highest concentration of Croatian Canadians are:\u000aToronto CMA: 37,460\u000aVancouver CMA: 15,670\u000aHamilton CMA: 13,655\u000a\u000a\u000a== Religious affiliation ==\u000aMost Croatian Canadians are Roman Catholic who follow the Latin Rite of their ancestors in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. A very small minority of Croatians are Byzantine Rite Roman Catholics. There is also a community of Croats who follow Islam, the descendants of those who converted after the 16th century, after the conquest of much of Croatia by the Ottomans. Communities of Protestants have historically been negligible in Croatia.\u000aIn Canada, the first ethnic Croatian parish was established in Windsor in 1950. Soon, parishes were established in Toronto (1951), Hamilton (1958), Vancouver (1967). Today there are ethnic Croatian parishes and missions in seventeen cities in Canada. In addition, previously unorganized Croats of the Muslim faith, with the arrival of eminent physician Asaf Durakovi\u0107 founded the Croatian Islamic Centre on June 23, 1973 in Etobicoke (75 Birmingham Street, Etobicoke, ON M8V 2C3), helped by the Croatian Catholic community. An old Catholic school was bought for 75,000 CAD and readjusted into masjid. There was also a community of Bosnian Muslims of Yugoslav option, but the Croat option of Bosnian Muslims never cooperated with them, since Muslim Croats considered all Yugoslavs and Communists as chetniks and as their worst enemies. Since the old building was in catastrophic condition, a new mosque was built on the site of the old one in 1983. Today, given changing political affiliations and political pressures from 1990's, and influx of non-Croat option of Bosnian Muslims,the center is now known as the Bosnian Islamic Centre. Despite that, today 4 out of 64 Canadian mosques have the attribute "Croatian". In Croatian Islamic Centre the children are taught the Croatian and Arabic languages, but there also Croatian Islamic newspapers, books, brochures, etc. Croatian Islamic Center called on Muslim governments, organisations, and individuals to press the Yugoslav regime, to end the persecution of Islam and to grant genuin equality of Muslims in Yugoslavia. The director of Centre Kerim Reis wanted that Belgrade releases the Muslim prisoners of conscience and to end to restrictions on the building of mosques. During Yugoslavia, this group often spoke accused Tito's Yugoslavia for practising discrimination both Muslim and Catholic Croats. While an overwhelming percentage of Croatians in Canada remain Roman Catholic, there are significant non-Catholic populations, including Protestants (most of whom have been in Canada for more than one generation) and Eastern Orthodox (the majority of whom are of mixed ethnic background).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notable Croatian Canadians ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Businesspeople ===\u000aRobert Herjavec - CEO of the Herjavec Group, one Canada's most prominent technology companies\u000aTihomir Ore\u0161kovi\u0107 - 11th Prime Minister of Croatia\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Politicians ===\u000aEve Adams - Liberal MP, Missisauga-Brampton South; born Eve Horvat to Hungarian-Croats parents\u000aBob Bratina - former Mayor of Hamilton, 2010\u20132014; Liberal MP, Hamilton East-Stoney Creek 2015\u2013Present\u000aJan Brown - former Reform/Independent MP Calgary Southeast, 1993-1997\u000aAllan Kerpan - Saskatchewan Party MLA, Carrot River Valley, 2003\u2013present; former Reform MP, Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, 1993-2000\u000aJanko Peric - former Liberal MP, Cambridge, 1993-2004\u000aPeter Sekulic former Alta Liberal MLA, Edmonton Manning, 1993-1997\u000aRoseanne Skoke - former Liberal MP, Central Nova, 1993-1997\u000aJohn Sola - former Liberal MPP, 1987\u20131995\u000aDave Stupich - former NDP MP, Nanaimo-Cowichan 1988-1993; former B.C.

aVLouis P. Fuhrmann (1868\u20131931) was Mayor of the City of Buffalo, New York, serving 1910\u20131917. He was born in Buffalo, New York on November 7, 1868. He grew up on the city's east side, graduated from Central High School, and began working in the meat packing industry. In 1892, he started his own meat packing business at 1010 Clinton Street. He married Alice S. Meald on July 13, 1900.\u000aIn 1905, Fuhrmann was first elected a member of the Board of Aldermen from the Fifth Ward. He was elected November 2, 1909, as the Democratic candidate. He was elected to a second term on November 4, 1913. During this term, America entered World War I and the Mayor was integral in assisting the Federal Government in coordination of the American forces. He was defeated in his quest for a third term on November 6, 1917, and returned to his meat packing business.\u000aIn 1917, he was elected president of the Buffalo Baseball and Amusement Company and, in 1922, appointed a member of the Buffalo Board of Education.

aVNakhodka (Russian: \u041d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430, IPA: [n\u0250\u02c8xotk\u0259]) is a port city in Primorsky Krai, Russia, located on the Trudny Peninsula jutting into the Nakhodka Bay of the Sea of Japan, about 85 kilometers (53 mi) east of Vladivostok, the administrative center of the krai. Population: 159,719\u2009(2010 Census); 148,826\u2009(2002 Census); 160,056\u2009(1989 Census).\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe Nakhodka Bay, around which the city is organized, was found in 1859 by the Russian corvette Amerika, which sought shelter in the bay during a storm. In honor of this occasion, the ice-free and relatively calm bay was named Nakhodka, which in Russian means "discovery" or "lucky find".\u000aAn imperial settlement existed here from 1868 to 1872 but was abandoned following the death of its administrator, Harold Furuhjelm. In the fall of 1870, Otto Wilhelm Lindholm established a whaling station across the bay from the settlement. In the spring of 1871 he fitted out his schooner Hannah Rice and sailed to Posyet, where he caught six gray whales.\u000aUntil the 20th century, the area around the bay remained uninhabited, with the first settlement a small fishing village founded in 1907. When the Soviet government decided to build a harbor in the area in the 1930s, a number of small settlements were founded, which were merged as a work settlement in the 1940s. On May 18, 1950, the settlement, by then with a population of about 28,000 residents, was granted town status.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Administrative and municipal status ==\u000aWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with three rural localities, incorporated as Nakhodka City Under Krai Jurisdiction\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Nakhodka City Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as Nakhodkinsky Urban Okrug.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Climate ==\u000aNakhodka has one of the mildest climates in Primorsky Krai and in the whole of the Asian part of Russia thanks to its southerly location and oceanic influences from the Sea of Japan. Average temperature in January is \u22129.3 °C (15.3 °F); in August (the warmest month), it is +20.6 °C (69.1 °F). It is classified as a humid continental climate due to the vast seasonal differences and is a very cold climate for a coastal location below 43 degrees latitude. The maritime influence is manifested in low diurnal temperature variation and a vast summer seasonal lag. Due to the influence of the interior, there is a sharp drop in temperatures between October and November. Half of the year has mean temperatures above 10 °C (50 °F), in spite of the warmest month being only moderately warm and the coldest month having quite severe cold, with a very low seasonal lag in winter.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Economy and infrastructure ==\u000a\u000aThe city's economy, based mostly around the port and port-related activity such as fish processing and canning, has suffered since 1991 as Vladivostok was opened to foreign activity again. Local industry also took a hit during the 1998 Russian financial crisis. However, Nakhodka has been declared a free economic zone, and the governments in both Moscow (federal) and Vladivostok (regional) have seemed interested in opening the city further to foreign investment.\u000aNakhodka is also an important transport junction where goods from Japan are transferred from ships onto the Russian railway system, including the Trans-Siberian Railway portion of the Eurasian Land Bridge.\u000aAs of 2010, there are 1,932 enterprises listed. There are 646 retail stores, 210 public catering entities, 9 markets. Annual turnover tops 13, 1 bln rubles (over 400, 400 USD). There operate many malls, supermarkets, federal chain store outlets in the city, the examples being Svyaznoy, Yevroset, Eldorado, and many others.\u000aCity's enterprises make their entry in the '100 best goods of Russia' nationwide contest, among numerous others, on a regular basis to a moderate success.\u000aThere was also opened a consulting center for young entrepreneurs, a collaboration of sister-cities' municipalities of Nakhodka and Bellingham, United States.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sports ==\u000aFC Okean Nakhodka is the only professional sport club in the city. It spent the 1992 and 1993 seasons in the Russian Premier League. It is also the home town of association football player Viktor Fayzulin.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Twin towns and sister cities ==\u000a\u000aNakhodka has the following sister city relationships:\u000a\u000a^1 First Soviet Union-Japan sister city\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Notes ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Sources ===\u000a\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0421\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f. \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u2116161-\u041a\u0417 \u043e\u0442 14 \u043d\u043e\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2001 \u0433. «\u041e\u0431 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f», \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u2116673-\u041a\u0417 \u043e\u0442 6 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2015 \u0433. «\u041e \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f "\u041e\u0431 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f"». \u0412\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0432 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0443 \u0441\u043e \u0434\u043d\u044f \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u041e\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d: "\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043c\u044f \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0440\u044c\u044f", \u211669 (119), 29 \u043d\u043e\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2001 \u0433.

aVThis is a list of minor characters that have appeared on the PBS Kids series Cyberchase.\u000aFor a list of Main Protagonists and Main Antagonists, as well as the characters of the "For Real" segment, see Cyberchase#Characters.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Secondary antagonists ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Baskerville ===\u000aBaskerville is a hunchback wolf-like cyborg with a British accent who has often been called up by Hacker to assist in his evil schemes. Hacker hired Baskerville because he wanted a henchman who was evil, cheap, and more reliable than Buzz and Delete. Baskerville took over the daily tasks of Buzz and Delete, earning him their disdain. Afterwards Buzz and Delete, out of jealousy, anonymously helped the cyber squad defeat Hacker. When Hacker went back to having bad luck, Baskerville quit his job with Hacker. Nevertheless, he has returned on many occasions to help Hacker \u2013 but he is constantly begrudged by Buzz and Delete in almost every case he is working on. Baskerville also made an appearance along with the Wicked Witch, who gathered some villains together to make a truce with Motherboard, in order to throw suspicion off of her own plots to take over Cyberspace. He is voiced by Juan Chioran. Baskerville is a reference to the Sherlock Holmes novel "The Hound of the Baskervilles".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ledge ===\u000aLedge (Alex Karzis) made his first debut in the episode "Hackerized", where he was the true mastermind for the Hackerization in "Sensible Flats". His goal was to convince Hacker that they should work together. He used deception in an attempt to separate the Cybersquad and ultimately get rid of them. This was done by creating a false friendship with the Cybersquad and eliminating each member one by one. He nearly succeeded in doing so until he was foiled by Inez's successful tactics in disabling the machine within the 3-minute limit. After being defeated by Inez, Hacker promptly rejected him. Inez and Hacker both hold grudges against him. Unlike Hacker, Ledge thinks through his plans more.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Wicked ===\u000aWicked (Linda Ballantyne) is a witch who lives in Happily Ever After and appears in many adventures. She has bright red hair, likes spending money, and has a quick temper. She wants to take over Cyberspace just as much as Hacker. She often tries to convince Hacker to become her partner. She and Hacker sometimes have a love for each other. Hacker has several times reluctantly hired or even courted her, but always jilts her. In return, Wicked either casts a spell on him or wrecks his evil-doing plans. Wicked, tired of seeing everybody happy and joyful, asked Hacker for help creating misery in Happily-Ever-After. She and Hacker, for most of the series, were in love with each other, but often their interactions would end in arguments. The Wicked Witch has since made multiple attempts to conquer Cyberspace herself, much to Hacker's dismay. She and Hacker have since taken their turns loving and hating each other. Wicked call them Hacker as Hacky-Poo.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Minor antagonists ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Warren ===\u000aWarren is a wayward genie who wants to rule Cyberspace.

During especially dry times, he and the fish will do a rain dance in attempt to bring the rain. He uses a line graph to keep track of the water level of the lake changes over time and to predict the future water level. He also helped Inez stop the Hackerization.\u000aChef Foody is a chef that is seen in 601 and 1002. In 601 he made one of his famous chocolate sculptures for Digit's birthday. He states that the chocolate must be kept at a certain temperature or it will melt. IN episode 1002, he appears as one of the judges in the cookoff between Hacker and Digit. He speaks with a French accent. Voiced by Dwayne Hill.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Shangri-La ===\u000aMaster Pi (voiced by Geoffrey Holder) is the reigning leader of Shangri-La, an East Asian-themed Cybersite, and is dressed in a blue robe and holds a rod with a ball with the symbol Pi.

At first, AVA does not trust the children, but becomes friendly with them after seeing evidence that Motherboard sent them.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Tikiville ===\u000aCreech is the young Big Kahuna (ruler) of Tikiville. She became the ruler after competing in a race with other Tikiville-inhabitants and Hacker. Creech is in some ways similar to Inez, helping the two to become friends easily. Both have a fairly similar outlook: optimistic until something goes completely wrong, and they both have a large vocabulary. She also is the person in charge of Tikiville's Egg of Benedicta. She is voiced by Stephanie Beard.\u000aMax is Creech's father. He went to school with Hacker and always beat Hacker at everything. He only appeared once and was voiced by Matthew Broderick.\u000aBig Kahuna is the Big Kahuna of Tikiville in episode 305. At the end of that episode, he hands over the title to Creech.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Thornia ===\u000aDeci helps around in Thornia.

Hacker attempts to kidnap Zanko to make his wish of taking over Cyberspace come true, but Delete and Zanko refuse to let him do so.\u000aRourke is a fairy Borg agent from the Fairy Borg Father Eligibility Department. It's his job to visit applicants and inform them if they are qualified for the Fairy Borg Father program or not. He visits Hacker only to explain to the latter that he cannot qualify for the Fairy Borg Father Program due to Hacker's many attempts to take over Cyberchase, meaning that he will never get any wishes ever.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The Black Hole ===\u000aBernie is the owner of the black hole. He charges disposal fees for objects dumped into the hole. Hacker intends to dispose the Encrpytor Chip with Motherboard into the black hole, but Bernie requires 10 million sneflus for the disposal, which Hacker does not have. Angered, Hacker tries to throw the chip into the hole, but it bounces back.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Movie exclusive characters ==\u000aOllie is an explorer boy voiced by Modern Family star Rico Rodriguez.

aVBénoué National Park is a national park of Cameroon and a UNESCO designated Biosphere Reserve. It is 180,000 ha (440,000 acres) in size. The park has a wide frontage to the Bénoué River, which stretches for over 100 km (62 mi), forming the eastern boundary. The public road to Tcholliré cuts across the northern part of the park. The western boundary is made up of the main road linking the towns of Garoua to the north, with Ngaoundéré to the south. The park can be accessed coming north from Ngaoundéré.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aIn 1932, the area was established as a Faunal Reserve. It was upgraded to a National Park in 1968, and in 1981, it became a Biosphere Reserve.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geography ==\u000a\u000aThe National Park is located in the northeastern part of Cameroon in the Bénoué Department. It lies in the Bénoué savanna belt, a humid savannah woodland area between the cities of Garoua in the north and Ngaoundéré to the south. The main river is the Bénoué River,which stretches for over 100 km (62 mi), forming the eastern boundary. The park's altitude ranges from 250 to 760 m (820 to 2,490 ft) above sea level.The higher elevations are characterized by large rocky massifs, while the undulating plain and forest characterizes the lower sections. Eight hunting reserves, totaling 520,378 ha (1,285,880 acres), surround the park except along the main road.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Flora and fauna ==\u000aThe habitat in Bénoué National Park is characterized by wooded grassland. It includes several types of Sudanian woodland such as Isoberlinia-dominated and other woodland in the south-centre, to shorter, more open, mixed wooded grassland in the north, dry Anogeissus forest, semi-evergreen riparian forest and thickets along the Bénoué and its major affluents.\u000aThere is a small population of about 30 Cameroon lions. Elephants, spotted hyena, water buck, warthog and monkeys are also found in the park. The predominant large ungulates in the park are antelope such as the kob, western hartebeest, Lord Derby's eland and waterbuck, as well as buffalo. The only place in Africa where there is a realistic change to view the Derby eland, Africa's largest antelope, is within Bénoué National Park. The African wild dog is present within the national park, though less common here than in Faro National Park. Bénoué National Park is known for its hippopotamus colonies. Along with hippo, crocodile are common in the rivers.\u000a\u000aBénoué National Park is an Important Bird Area (#CM007) with recent surveys identifying 306 species. In the dry season, sandbars exposed by fluctuating levels of the sandy Bénoué River provide habitat for plover and other waterbirds. Common species include Adamawa turtle-dove, crocodile bird, red-throated bee-eater, red-winged grey warbler, stone partridge, and violet turaco.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Population ==\u000aThe majority of the population within the park is nomadic. There is a loose social structure that park guards and conservationists deal with, taking on roles such as community educators and arbitrators. At least one incident of kleptoparasitism, stealing meat from a lion kill, was documented at Bénoué National Park.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aMayakaa, Theodore B.

aVThe ecological footprint measures human demand on nature, i.e., the quantity of nature it takes to support people or an economy. It tracks this demand through an ecological accounting system. The accounts contrast the biologically productive area people use for their consumption to the biologically productive area available within a region or the world (biocapacity). In short, it is a measure of human impact on Earth's ecosystem and reveals the dependence of the human economy on natural capital.\u000aThe ecological footprint is defined as the biologically productive area needed to provide for everything people use: fruits and vegetables, fish, wood, fibers, absorption of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel use, and space for buildings and roads. Biocapacity is the productive area that can regenerate what people demand from nature.\u000aFootprint and biocapacity can be compared at the individual, regional, national or global scale. Both footprint and biocapacity change every year with number of people, per person consumption, efficiency of production, and productivity of ecosystems.At a global scale, footprint assessments show how big humanity's demand is compared to what planet Earth can renew. Global Footprint Network calculates the ecological footprint from UN and other data for the world as a whole and for over 200 nations. They estimate that as of 2013, humanity has been using natural capital 1.6 times as fast as nature can renew it.\u000aEcological footprint analysis is widely used around the Earth in support of sustainability assessments. It can be used to measure and manage the use of resources throughout the economy and explore the sustainability of individual lifestyles, goods and services, organizations, industry sectors, neighborhoods, cities, regions and nations. Since 2006, a first set of ecological footprint standards exist that detail both communication and calculation procedures. The latest version are the updated standards from 2009\u000a\u000a\u000a== Footprint measurements ==\u000aIn 2013, the Global Cat stem services|ecological services]] were being used 1.6 times faster than they were being renewed.\u000a\u000aEcological footprints can be calculated at any scale: for an activity, a person, a commmunity, a city,a town, a region, a nation or humanity as a whole. Cities, due to population concentration, have large ecological footprints and have become ground zero for footprint reduction.\u000aGlobal Footprints: Currently there is no fixed way to measure global footprints, and any attempts to describe the capacity of an ecosystem in a single number is a massive simplification of thousands of key renewable resources, which are not used or replenished at the same rate. However, there has been some convergence of metrics and standards since 2006.\u000aCity Ecological Footprints: are being measured. There are two types of measurements in use. The first measures ecosystem displacement which is defined as City Area minus remaining green spaces. This is an area measurement that does not include human or other biological activity. The Second attempts to quantify surviving ecosystem health. Specifically, it attempts to quantify both area and biological health of ecosystems surviving inside city areas such as nature reserves, parks, other green spaces. City footprints are being calculated and ranked with city ecological indexes.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Overview ==\u000aThe first academic publication about ecological footprints was by William Rees in 1992. The ecological footprint concept and calculation method was developed as the PhD dissertation of Mathis Wackernagel, under Rees' supervision at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, from 1990\u20131994. Originally, Wackernagel and Rees called the concept "appropriated carrying capacity". To make the idea more accessible, Rees came up with the term "ecological footprint", inspired by a computer technician who praised his new computer's "small footprint on the desk". In early 1996, Wackernagel and Rees published the book Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing Human Impact on the Earth with illustrations by Phil Testemale.\u000aFootprint values at the end of a survey are categorized for Carbon, Food, Housing, and Goods and Services as well as the total footprint number of Earths needed to sustain the world's population at that level of consumption. This approach can also be applied to an activity such as the manufacturing of a product or driving of a car. This resource accounting is similar to life-cycle analysis wherein the consumption of energy, biomass (food, fiber), building material, water and other resources are converted into a normalized measure of land area called global hectares (gha).\u000aPer capita ecological footprint (EF), or ecological footprint analysis (EFA), is a means of comparing consumption and lifestyles, and checking this against nature's ability to provide for this consumption. The tool can inform policy by examining to what extent a nation uses more (or less) than is available within its territory, or to what extent the nation's lifestyle would be replicable worldwide. The footprint can also be a useful tool to educate people about carrying capacity and overconsumption, with the aim of altering personal behavior. Ecological footprints may be used to argue that many current lifestyles are not sustainable. Such a global comparison also clearly shows the inequalities of resource use on this planet at the beginning of the twenty-first century.\u000aIn 2007, the average biologically productive area per person worldwide was approximately 1.8 global hectares (gha) per capita. The U.S. footprint per capita was 9.0 gha, and that of Switzerland was 5.6 gha, while China's was 1.8 gha. The WWF claims that the human footprint has exceeded the biocapacity (the available supply of natural resources) of the planet by 20%. Wackernagel and Rees originally estimated that the available biological capacity for the 6 billion people on Earth at that time was about 1.3 hectares per person, which is smaller than the 1.8 global hectares published for 2006, because the initial studies neither used global hectares nor included bioproductive marine areas.\u000aA number of NGOs offer ecological footprint calculators (see Footprint Calculator, below).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Methodology ==\u000aThe ecological footprint accounting method at the national level is described in the l Footprint Atlas 2010 or in greater detail in the Calculation Methodology for the National Footprint Accounts. The National Accounts Review Committee has also published a research agenda on how the method will be improved.\u000aIn 2003, Jason Venetoulis, Carl Mas, Christopher Gaudet, Dahlia Chazan, and John Talberth developed Footprint 2., which offers a series of theoretical and methodological improvements to the standard footprint approach. The four primary improvements were that they included the entire surface of the Earth in biocapacity estimates, allocated space for other (i.e., non-human) species, updated the basis of equivalence factors from agricultural land to net primary productivity (NPP), and refined the carbon component of the footprint based on the latest global carbon models.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Studies in the United Kingdom ==\u000aThe UK's average ecological footprint is 5.45 global hectares per capita (gha) with variations between regions ranging from 4.80 gha (Wales) to 5.56 gha (East England).\u000aTwo recent studies have examined relatively low-impact small communities. BedZED, a 96-home mixed-income housing development in South London, was designed by Bill Dunster Architects and sustainability consultants BioRegional for the Peabody Trust. Despite being populated by relatively "mainstream" home-buyers, BedZED was found to have a footprint of 3.20 gha due to on-site renewable energy production, energy-efficient architecture, and an extensive green lifestyles program that included on-site London's first carsharing club. The report did not measure the added footprint of the 15,000 visitors who have toured BedZED since its completion in 2002. Findhorn Ecovillage, a rural intentional community in Moray, Scotland, had a total footprint of 2.56 gha, including both the many guests and visitors who travel to the community to undertake residential courses there and the nearby campus of Cluny Hill College. However, the residents alone have a footprint of 2.71 gha, a little over half the UK national average and one of the lowest ecological footprints of any community measured so far in the industrialized world. Keveral Farm, an organic farming community in Cornwall, was found to have a footprint of 2.4 gha, though with substantial differences in footprints among community members.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Ecological footprint at the individual level ==\u000aIn a 2012 study of consumers acting "green" vs. "brown" (where green people are «expected to have significantly lower ecological impact than \u201cbrown\u201d consumers»), the conclusion was "the research found no significant difference between the carbon footprints of green and brown consumers". A 2013 study concluded the same.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reviews and critiques ==\u000aEarly criticism was published by van den Bergh and Verbruggen in 1999, which was updated in 2014. Another criticism was published in 2008. A more complete review commissioned by the Directorate-General for the Environment (European Commission) was published in June 2008. The review found Ecological Footprint "a useful indicator for assessing progress on the EU\u2019s Resource Strategy" the authors noted that Ecological Footprint analysis was unique "in its ability to relate resource use to the concept of carrying capacity." The review noted that further improvements in data quality, methodologies and assumptions were needed.\u000aA recent critique of the concept is due to Blomqvist et al., 2013a, with a reply from Rees and Wackernagel, 2013, and a rejoinder by Blomqvist et al., 2013b.\u000aAn additional strand of critique is due to Giampietro and Saltelli (2014a), with a reply from Goldfinger et al., 2014, a rejoinder by Giampietro and Saltelli (2014a), and additional comments from van den Bergh and Grazi (2015).\u000aA number of countries have engaged in research collaborations to test the validity of the method. This includes Switzerland, Germany, United Arab Emirates, and Belgium.\u000aGrazi et al. (2007) have performed a systematic comparison of the ecological footprint method with spatial welfare analysis that includes environmental externalities, agglomeration effects and trade advantages. They find that the two methods can lead to very distinct, and even opposite, rankings of different spatial patterns of economic activity. However this should not be surprising, since the two methods address different research questions.\u000aCalculating the ecological footprint for densely populated areas, such as a city or small country with a comparatively large population \u2014 e.g. New York and Singapore respectively \u2014 may lead to the perception of these populations as "parasitic". This is because these communities have little intrinsic biocapacity, and instead must rely upon large hinterlands. Critics argue that this is a dubious characterization since mechanized rural farmers in developed nations may easily consume more resources than urban inhabitants, due to transportation requirements and the unavailability of economies of scale. Furthermore, such moral conclusions seem to be an argument for autarky. Some even take this train of thought a step further, claiming that the Footprint denies the benefits of trade. Therefore, the critics argue that the Footprint can only be applied globally.\u000aThe method seems to reward the replacement of original ecosystems with high-productivity agricultural monocultures by assigning a higher biocapacity to such regions. For example, replacing ancient woodlands or tropical forests with monoculture forests or plantations may improve the ecological footprint. Similarly, if organic farming yields were lower than those of conventional methods, this could result in the former being "penalized" with a larger ecological footprint. Of course, this insight, while valid, stems from the idea of using the footprint as one's only metric. If the use of ecological footprints are complemented with other indicators, such as one for biodiversity, the problem could maybe be solved. Indeed, WWF's Living Planet Report complements the biennial Footprint calculations with the Living Planet Index of biodiversity. Manfred Lenzen and Shauna Murray have created a modified Ecological Footprint that takes biodiversity into account for use in Australia.\u000aAlthough the ecological footprint model prior to 2008 treated nuclear power in the same manner as coal power, the actual real world effects of the two are radically different. A life cycle analysis centered on the Swedish Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant estimated carbon dioxide emissions at 3.10 g/kWh and 5.05 g/kWh in 2002 for the Torness Nuclear Power Station. This compares to 11 g/kWh for hydroelectric power, 950 g/kWh for installed coal, 900 g/kWh for oil and 600 g/kWh for natural gas generation in the United States in 1999. Figures released by Mark Hertsgaard, however, show that because of the delays in building nuclear plants and the costs involved, investments in energy efficiency and renewable energies have seven times the return on investment of investments in nuclear energy.\u000a\u000aThe Swedish utility Vattenfall did a study of full life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources the utility uses to produce electricity, namely: Nuclear, Hydro, Coal, Gas, Solar Cell, Peat and Wind. The net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 3.3 grams of carbon dioxide per KW-Hr of produced power. This compares to 400 for natural gas and 700 for coal (according to this study). The study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of CO2 of any of their electricity sources.\u000aClaims exist that the problems of nuclear waste do not come anywhere close to approaching the problems of fossil fuel waste. A 2004 article from the BBC states: "The World Health Organization (WHO) says 3 million people are killed worldwide by outdoor air pollution annually from vehicles and industrial emissions, and 1.6 million indoors through using solid fuel." In the U.S. alone, fossil fuel waste kills 20,000 people each year. A coal power plant releases 100 times as much radiation as a nuclear power plant of the same wattage. It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the Three Mile Island incident. In addition, fossil fuel waste causes global warming, which leads to increased deaths from hurricanes, flooding, and other weather events. The World Nuclear Association provides a comparison of deaths due to accidents among different forms of energy production. In their comparison, deaths per TW-yr of electricity produced (in UK and USA) from 1970 to 1992 are quoted as 885 for hydropower, 342 for coal, 85 for natural gas, and 8 for nuclear.\u000aThe Western Australian government State of the Environment Report included an Ecological Footprint measure for the average Western Australian seven times the average footprint per person on the planet in 2007, a total of about 15 hectares.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Footprint by country ==\u000a\u000aThe world-average ecological footprint in 2013 was 2.8 global hectares per person. The average per country ranges from over 10 to under 1 global hectares per person. There is also a high variation within countries, based on individual lifestyle and economic possibilities.\u000aThe GHG footprint or the more narrow carbon footprint are a component of the ecological footprint. Often, when only the carbon footprint is reported, it is expressed in weight of CO2 (or CO2e representing GHG warming potential (GGWP)), but it can also be expressed in land areas like ecological footprints. Both can be applied to products, people or whole societies.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Implications ==\u000a\u000a. . . the average world citizen has an eco-footprint of about 2.7 global average hectares while there are only 2.1 global hectare of bioproductive land and water per capita on earth. This means that humanity has already overshot global biocapacity by 30% and now lives unsustainabily by depleting stocks of "natural capital"\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aSince the 1950s, a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene has been proposed to distinguish the period of major human impact.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aRees, W.

aVThe Rugby by-election, 1942 was a parliamentary by-election for the British House of Commons constituency of Rugby on 29 April 1942.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Vacancy ==\u000aThe by-election was caused by the resignation of the sitting Conservative MP, David Margesson in March 1942. He had been MP here since gaining the seat from the Liberal, Ernest Brown in 1924. Margesson had been Secretary of State for War until February 1942 when Winston Churchill sacked him following the fall of Singapore.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Election history ==\u000aRugby had been won by the Conservative Party at every election since 1924 and was a safe seat. The result at the last General election was as follows;\u000a\u000a\u000a== Candidates ==\u000aThe local Conservatives selected 56-year-old Lt-Col. Sir Claude Holbrook. He was a serving officer with the Royal Army Service Corps who had also served in the European War from 1914-18. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Warwickshire in 1931. He had been Chairman of Rugby Conservative Association since 1927. He was Officer-in-Charge of a big Ordnance Depot. The Labour party had selected A E Millett to contest a General Election expected to take place in 1939-40. He had fought Yeovil in 1935, coming third behind the Liberal. Although the General Election had not taken place because of the war, he had remained active for the Labour party in Rugby and was still officially their candidate. In accordance with the terms of the wartime electoral truce, Millett was not put forward by the Rugby Labour party. The Liberals had not fought the constituency since 1929 and had no candidate in place. The Rugby Liberals had remained active through their Chairman, M E Avery, but did not put forward a candidate.\u000aHowever an Independent candidate did emerge to challenge the Conservatives, in the shape of 48-year-old William Brown. He had a history of going up against the party machines. Although he was elected Labour MP for Wolverhampton West in 1929 he had resigned from the party in 1930 along with Oswald Mosley when the Labour government failed to tackle unemployment. However, he did not join Mosley's New Party and instead continued in parliament as an Independent Labour member. Under that label, he was defeated in the 1931 elections even though no official Labour candidate opposed him. By the 1935 elections, the Wolverhampton West Labour party did oppose him but did very poorly, while Brown came second standing as an Independent. Brown did however have a political power-base, he had been General Secretary of the Civil Service Clerical Association since he founded the organisation in 1921. The union membership were government employees and thus it was not affiliated to the Labour party.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Campaign ==\u000aPolling day was set for 29 April 1942. When nominations closed, it was to reveal a two horse race, the Conservative local man, Holbrook, against the Independent outsider, Brown. Holbrook demonstrated what he thought about the situation by stating that the electors of the division were against holding an election.\u000aBrown chose as his election agent, another outsider in Reg Hipwell who was a Services Journalist and had himself fought the Hampstead by-election, 1941 as an Independent candidate.\u000aOn the 14 April 1942 Brown's 6 point policy plan was released in the Birmingham Post; 1. Total efficiency in total war effort. 2. Reconstitution of the Government on a non-party basis. 3. Breaking through the contradictions in production, the Civil Service, politics and propaganda, which hinder the war effort. 4. Maintenance of the freedom of the public Press and of public criticism against the growing tendency of the Government towards suppression. 5. Democratisation of the Army. 6. Real equality of sacrifice.\u000aAt the start of the campaign Holbrook was sharply criticised by a Magistrate in open Court for being very unhelpful to the police, who had been trying to enquire into thefts from the Ordnance Depot of which he was the Officer-in-Charge. The case had been widely reported in the Press. Brown telegraphed Prime Minister Winston Churchill drawing attention to the reports asking if Churchill proposed to send a letter commending Holbrook to the electors of Rugby. Churchill did not reply but did as Brown had expected.\u000aAs was usual, Holbrook received a joint letter of endorsement from all the leaders of the parties in the coalition. Interestingly, one of these signatories was Ernest Brown the leader of the Liberal Nationals, who had been the MP in the constituency until defeated by Margesson in 1924.\u000aThe Rugby Labour party was split over Brown's candidature. Some members wanted to support him because he was a leading trade unionist and easily to the left of Holbrook, while others felt that it was important to follow the party leader, Clement Attlee, who had endorsed Holbrook. The National Council of Labour passed a resolution condemning Brown as a disruptive individual, not a fit and proper person to represent the working classes.\u000aHolbrook lost his temper and made some very damaging statements about Brown, which seemed to gain Brown public sympathy. Embarrassed by Brown's telegram to Churchill, which had become front page news, he issued a writ of libel against Brown. This ensured that Brown would be kept quiet on further raising issues in connection with the depot. Holbrook was to later drop the case and paid all costs.\u000aCampaign slogans played their part; the Conservative campaign for Holbrook - "Vote for Holbrook, the man whom Churchill wants". The Brown campaign countered this with "Vote for Brown, the man whom Churchill needs!"\u000aThe issue of the Second Front in Europe came to the fore late in the campaign. Holbrook's position was that it was too soon to establish it. This upset the local Communist party, who had been instructed by their headquarters in London to call on their supporters to vote for Holbrook as the best way of getting it. Brown belatedly came out in support of the Second Front. The retired Rugby Conservative MP, David Margesson warned voters that Adolf Hitler would gloat if Brown got in.\u000aOn the eve of poll, Holbrook wrote an article for the local press entitled "Why I Won".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Result ==\u000aHolbrook had been premature with his article for the papers as he lost.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Aftermath ==\u000aIn 1945, free from the restrictions of the electoral truce, the Labour party fielded a candidate against Brown and finished last. Brown held onto his seat, the result at the following General election;\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of United Kingdom by-elections\u000aUnited Kingdom by-election records\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aV"Vincent and the Doctor" is the tenth episode in the fifth series of British science fiction television series Doctor Who, first broadcast on BBC One on 5 June 2010. It was written by Richard Curtis and directed by Jonny Campbell and featured an uncredited guest appearance from actor Bill Nighy.\u000aIntrigued by an ominous figure in one of Vincent van Gogh's paintings, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) go back in time to meet Van Gogh (Tony Curran) and discover that Provence has been plagued by an invisible monster, known as the Krafayis, which only Van Gogh can see. The Doctor and Amy work with Van Gogh to defeat the Krafayis, but in their attempt to have Van Gogh realise his legacy through bringing him to the future they ultimately realise that not all of time can be rewritten and there are some evils which are out of the Doctor's reach.\u000aCurtis, inspired by the fact that Van Gogh never knew he would be famous, had the idea for an episode centred on him. He left the script open to criticism from the crew and made many revisions as a result. Curtis wanted to portray Van Gogh truthfully, rather than being cruel by writing jokes about his mental illness. Most of the episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia, and many of the sets were modelled after Van Gogh paintings. The episode was watched by 6.76 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD. Reception to the episode varied, ranging from very positive to mixed to very negative. While the amount of emotion in the episode was debated, many reviewers agreed that Curran's performance as Van Gogh was excellent, but that the Krafayis was not a threatening monster.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Synopsis ===\u000aThe Doctor has taken Amy to the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, where they admire the work of the post-impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. The Doctor discovers a seemingly alien figure in a window of the painting The Church at Auvers, and decides they must travel back in time to speak to Vincent around when he painted the painting. In 1890, they find Vincent at a cafe in Arles, a lonely man with a bad reputation. Vincent opens up when he notices Amy, sensing a loss she herself is not aware of. Outside the cafe a young girl is murdered, when the trio go out to see what happened they are stoned by locals who blame Vincent's insanity for the killing. The Doctor and Amy talk Vincent into letting them stay the night and they return to his home.\u000aThat evening, Vincent confesses that his works have little value to anyone else. He believes the universe is filled with wonders that he must paint, and that he can "hear the colours". Amy goes outside and is attacked by a beast that only Vincent is able to see. He sketches it for the Doctor, who identifies it as a Krafayis. Knowing the beast will appear when Vincent paints the nearby church the next evening, the Doctor and Amy plan to join him. The next morning, Vincent becomes distraught after being told that the Doctor and Amy won't be staying long. Vincent shuts himself in his bedroom, saying that everyone leaves him in the end. The Doctor and Amy set out to capture the beast alone, but Vincent soon joins them eager to help. He confides to Amy that if she can "soldier on, then so can Vincent van Gogh".\u000aVincent begins creating the painting of the church and soon spots the beast inside. The Doctor demands that Amy stay back as he enters the church alone, but she and Vincent both agree they should help the Doctor. Vincent is able to save the Doctor and Amy, describing the beast's actions as they hide in the confessionals. The Doctor soon realises from Vincent's description that the beast is blind, the likely reason it was abandoned on Earth, and is frightened of its surroundings. The beast is impaled on Vincent's easel when it tries to lunge at the artist. The Doctor attempts to soothe the dying creature while Vincent empathises with its pain. After the creature dies, the three return outside the church and Vincent describes the night sky as he envisions it.\u000aThe next day, the Doctor and Amy prepare to leave. Vincent asks Amy to return and marry him should she leave the Doctor. The Doctor offers to show him something. The Doctor and Amy take Vincent in the TARDIS to the present and the Van Gogh exhibit at the Musée d'Orsay. Vincent is stunned at the display and becomes emotionally overwhelmed when he overhears art curator Dr. Black (Bill Nighy) say that Van Gogh was "the greatest painter of them all" and "one of the greatest men who ever lived". They return an emotionally changed Vincent to the past and say their final goodbyes. As the Doctor and Amy return to the present, Amy is confident that there will be hundreds of new paintings by Vincent waiting for them, though the Doctor is less certain. The former is crushed to learn that Vincent still committed suicide weeks after their adventure, at the age of 37. The Doctor explains that life is a mixture of bad and good, and while their brief encounter with Vincent couldn't undo all of the bad, they added some good to his life. The evidence is in Vincent's displayed works: the face no longer appears in The Church, and now Vase with 12 Sunflowers bears the inscription, "For Amy".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Continuity ===\u000aImages of the First and Second Doctors are displayed on the Doctor's mirror device and printout from the TARDIS' typewriter. The episode presents these trips as the Doctor's compensation to Amy for her fiancé Rory Williams' death in the previous episode, which Amy herself does not remember since Rory was consumed by a crack in the universe and thus erased from time. Van Gogh is able to sense Amy's sadness at Rory's death, and the Doctor later accidentally addresses Amy and Vincent as Amy and Rory, respectively.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Writing ===\u000a\u000aWriter Richard Curtis was previously executive producer on the Doctor Who spoof The Curse of Fatal Death, a one-off comedy special written for Comic Relief by current show-runner Steven Moffat. Based on this experience, Moffat asked Curtis to write an episode of Doctor Who. Curtis had enjoyed the show's historical episodes and felt comfortable writing one. He had the idea of a story centred on Van Gogh for "a long while" and was particularly interested in the fact Van Gogh never knew he would be famous, as well as his inspirational story. Curtis was also interested in depression and the price paid for it. He wanted to convey that the Doctor could rewrite time, but Van Gogh's "demons" were out of his reach. Moffat was "enthusiastic" about the story idea.\u000aCurtis asked Moffat to criticise "anything and everything" and later said he was very honest. Executive producer Piers Wenger and director Jonny Campbell also critiqued the script. Moffat told Curtis that it needed to "start quicker" and that the meeting with the Doctor and Vincent was "dull" and needed to be something "cute" like Curtis had done in his films. He also noted that the Doctor did not talk as much as Curtis had written and recommended Curtis watch some episodes to see he was "rather efficient in the way that he talked". Curtis enjoyed the experience, commenting that it was "fun" to work within boundaries rather than doing it all himself. After seeing a read-through performed by leads Matt Smith and Karen Gillan, Curtis made more changes. He commented that it was easy to write for them as they were "so delightful and modern and relaxed". Curtis's original title for the episode was "Eyes that See the Darkness", but he said this was vetoed.\u000aCurtis wanted to write for Doctor Who because he thought it would be "something my kids would like." When writing "Vincent and the Doctor", Curtis put up prints of Van Gogh paintings around the house as well as a board with index cards outlining the plot. His children helped him come up with some ideas. Gillan commented that the story had a different style and approach and was more character-driven. Though it was a subject he knew "quite a lot" about, he still read a 200-page biography of Van Gogh, which was more research than he normally would have done if working on other projects; he took Van Gogh very seriously. As such, he wanted to be "truthful rather than cruel" and refused to write any jokes about Van Gogh's ears after he famously cut one of them off. However, he did incorporate other humour as he naturally wanted to "try to make things funny".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Casting and filming ===\u000a\u000aCurtis stated that casting an actor to play Van Gogh was done carefully, as he wanted him to feel to the audience as Van Gogh, not "like a bloke they\u2019ve seen acting lots of other parts, in an orange wig". Tony Curran was ultimately cast as the part; Curtis called him a "wonderful actor" who "really could not look more like" Van Gogh. Curran, Smith and Gillan got to know each other very well, which Gillan hoped would be evident in their chemistry in the episode. Bill Nighy appears uncredited as the Musée d'Orsay's expert on Van Gogh. Nighy was rumoured to have been considered for the role of the Ninth Doctor when the show was revived. Campbell stated that they were "very fortunate" to have Nighy in the role, who he believed was someone people paid attention to, and the audience needed to pay attention to his character as he said facts which would become important later in the story.\u000aScenes set in Provence were filmed on location in Trogir, Croatia, in the same production block as "The Vampires of Venice", which sees Trogir depicting 16th-century Venice. Filming took place around November 2009. The scenes at the church which were filmed at Llandaff Cathedral in Wales, while the National Museum Cardiff doubled for the interior of the Musée d'Orsay. Some of the sets were intended to reference paintings, such as Van Gogh's bedroom. One such set was the café where the Doctor and Amy first meet Van Gogh, which was modelled after the painting Cafe Terrace at Night. This proved challenging for the art department, who extensively looked for a suitable building in Croatia to use. Once they found the one they wanted, they had to redesign it to look like the painting; this involved putting an awning up, changing the windows, and adding a platform with tables and chairs. The song played during the ending scene is "Chances" by the British rock band Athlete.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Broadcast and reception ==\u000a"Vincent and the Doctor" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One and simulcast on BBC HD on 5 June 2010. Initial overnight ratings showed that the episode was watched by 5 million, the second rated show of the day and the first on BBC One. Final consolidated ratings rose to 6.76 million, with 6.29 on BBC One and a further 0.47 on BBC HD. It was the second most watched programme on BBC One and the highest on BBC HD. It was given an Appreciation Index of 86, considered "excellent".\u000aAfter the original broadcast, viewers were offered a helpline if they had been affected by the issues raised in the programme. "Vincent and the Doctor" was released in Region 2 on DVD and Blu-ray on 6 September 2010 with "The Lodger", "The Pandorica Opens" and "The Big Bang". It was then re-released as part of the Complete Fifth Series boxset on 8 November 2010.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Critical reception ===\u000aSince its broadcast, Vincent and the Doctor has received critical acclaim. Dave Golder of SFX magazine gave the episode five out of five stars, calling it "a genuinely magical episode of Who, high on atmosphere...and bursting with charm". John Moore, writing on Den of Geek, also took a positive stance towards the episode, describing it as "life-affirming" as a Doctor Who fan, and, though he did criticise some elements of the plot, likewise wrote positively about the ending, ultimately finding the episode "utterly useless, but absolutely art". Keith Watson in the Metro was surprised by the "impressive imagining of Van Gogh's world", praising Curtis' humour throughout the episode. He also praised the performance by Curran as Van Gogh, feeling that, with regard to Van Gogh's depression, the producers "pulled it off" against the odds. Mark Lawson of The Guardian praised it as "exceptionally good" and "thrilling and funny, as well as educational", noting its "historical rigour" and its "good arty jokes", while Deborah Orr wrote that it was "hardly original for someone to alight on [Van Gogh's] tale as a tear-jerker, although it is pretty shrewd to think of placing it in a popular time-travel context" and that "the feeling that I'd been gently monstered into life-affirming feel-good sobs by Richard Curtis was not new, not in the least".\u000aIn the mainstream press, Tom Sutcliffe in The Independent praised the episode as "first ingenious and then decidedly poignant", though he felt some aspects of plot would have wider implications not addressed in the episode, and remained "coldly unfeeling" towards the death of the Krafayis. Sam Wollaston of The Guardian liked the episode, considering Curtis' dialogue to be "witty and clever" and, despite feeling that some of the moral sentiments expressed during the episode were "as schmaltzy as sugary gloop", described how the emotion of the episode eventually got to him. The A.V. Club's Keith Phipps gave the episode a B-, explaining that it "didn't quite work" and suffered from tonal problems. Matt Wales on IGN was also mixed, giving it a 7.5 out of 10 rating. He was positive toward Curran and Gillan and that the episode "finally gave us a three-dimensional Amy Pond", but thought the "usually excellent" Smith "didn't get much to work with". He also thought that the Krafayis was "a nice idea" for being a metaphor but was not threatening, and he labelled the emotional ending as "self-indulgently mawkish".\u000aOn The Guardian film blog, Peter Bradshaw considered "Vincent and the Doctor" to be a "terrifically clever, funny, likeable wildly surreal episode". He praised the "unmistakeably [sic] Curtis dialogue" and the "uproariously emotional ending of the sort only Richard Curtis could get away with". Dan Martin on the same paper's regular Doctor Who blog was more critical, writing that its "main problem [was] that it doesn't feel much like a Doctor Who story" and would have worked better if "the middle section with the monster had been stripped out". He also criticised the script for its "lashings of weapons-grade sentimentality" and for "throwing up possibilities that weren't followed up" and the monster as an "afterthought [posing]...no tangible threat". However, he did praise Curran's "great performance" along with the episode's treatment of depression, concluding like Wollaston that he enjoyed the episode despite his misgivings.\u000aOne of the most negative reviews came from Gavin Fuller in The Telegraph, who criticised it as a "bland, inconsequential episode that, once it set up what was a decent enough premise...completely failed to run with it". He compared it unfavourably with the third series episode "The Shakespeare Code" in being centred round a historical "tormented artist" but wrote that it lacked that episode's "narrative drive", with "a serious plot hole" in Van Gogh's ability to see the creature and that the Krafayis was "the most pointless monsters ever to appear in the series' long history". He also criticised Smith's Doctor and wrote that Van Gogh still committing suicide despite the trip to the Orsay was "nonsensical". He did, however, praise "the Doctor's homily about good things and bad things" (though Sam Wollaston criticised this speech in The Guardian) and was grateful that Curtis "avoided turning the Doctor into a bumbling Hugh Grant character from his romcoms", concluding however "he did little else right and a crushing disappointment was the result".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Awards and nominations ===\u000a\u000a"Vincent and the Doctor" was nominated for the Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation in the 2010 Nebula Awards and the 2011 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form). It lost both of these; the Bradbury to the film Inception and the Hugo to the series finale "The Pandorica Opens"/"The Big Bang". In Canada's Constellation Awards, Curran was nominated (alongside Smith) for Best Actor and Curtis for Best Script; Curran came in sixth with 10% of the votes and Curtis came in second, losing out to Christopher Nolan's Inception by one percent of the vote.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a\u000aVincent and the Doctor on Tardis Data Core,  an external wiki\u000a"Vincent and the Doctor" at the BBC Doctor Who homepage\u000a"Vincent and the Doctor" on IMDb\u000a"Vincent and the Doctor" at Doctor Who: A Brief History of Time (Travel)\u000a"Vincent and the Doctor" at the Doctor Who Reference Guide\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Reviews ===\u000a"Vincent and the Doctor" reviews at The Doctor Who Ratings Guide

aVWilliam V (or Guilhem V; died 1121) was the Lord of Montpellier from 1068 until his death. He was the son of William IV.\u000aSoon after his father's death, his mother, Ermengarde, quit Montpellier to marry the Lord of Anduze. William IV had confided the tutelage of his son to the child's grandmother, Beliarde, and to his nearest relatives: William Arnold, Raymond Stephen, and William Aymoin. After a short conflict with the bishop of Maguelonne, William V rendered homage to the bishop on 10 December 1090 and was recognised as lord of Montpellier.\u000aAt the call of Pope Urban II, William took up the cross of the First Crusade in the army of Raymond IV of Toulouse. He served notably at the capture of the small Syrian village of Ma'arrat al-Numan in 1098. After the fall of Jerusalem in 1099, William remained in the Holy Land for a while. He remained at the side of Godfrey de Bouillon and accompanied him to the siege of Antioch in December 1097. He did not return to Montpellier until 1103, bringing with him a relic of Saint Cleopas.\u000aWhen William returned, he found that the Aimoin brothers to whom he had confided the administration of the lordship in his absence had usurped many seigniorial rights and that he was obligated to recognise much of their newfound authority, which diminished his own, in order to retain his position.\u000aWilliam participated in the army of Raymond Berengar III of Barcelona which captured Majorca from the Moors in 1114. The rest of his reign was marked by the important acquisition of nearby territories, which greatly recouped his power: Montarnaud, Cournonsec, Montferrier, Frontignan, Aumelas, Montbazin, Popian.\u000aBy his marriage to Ermensenda, daughter of Peter, Count of Mauguio, he had six children:\u000aWilliam VI\u000aWilliam of Aumelas\u000aBernard, Lord of Villeneuve\u000aGuillelme, married Raymon Bernard, Count of Mauguio\u000aErmeniarde\u000aAdelaide.\u000aUpon his death, he was succeeded by his son William as Lord of Montpellier.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sources ==\u000aRiley-Smith, Jonathan, The First Crusaders, 1095-1131, Cambridge University Press, London, 1997, pg. 158, 166,226 (available on Google Books)\u000aRunciman, Steven, A History of the Crusades, Volume One: The First Crusade and the Foundation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Cambridge University Press, London, 1951, pg.160, 259\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==

aVThe 8th Battalion (90th Winnipeg Rifles), CEF, was an infantry battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the Great War. The battalion was authorized on 10 August 1914 and embarked for Great Britain on 1 October 1914. It disembarked in France on 13 February 1915, where it fought as part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, 1st Canadian Division in France and Flanders until the end of the war.

aVThe Salisbury cathedral clock is a large iron-framed clock without a dial located in the aisle of Salisbury Cathedral. Supposedly dating from about 1386, it is said to be the oldest working clock in the world, although a similar statement is made of the clock in the cathedral of Beauvais in France (said to date from 1305) and the clock tower of Chioggia in Italy, which most likely holds the primacy. The clock is one of the group of 14th to 16th century clocks to be found in the West of England. (See also Wells, Exeter, Castle Combe, Ottery St Mary, and Wimborne Minster.) An attempt to date this clock to around 1386 was made by T.R. Robinson. His estimated date has been supported by others. Most of the parts of the striking train are believed to be original. The great wheel of the going train is also believed to be original.\u000aOther clocks from the 14th century (the first century in which the mechanical clock flourished throughout Europe), such as those at Rouen (Gros Horloge), Paris (Heinrich von Wick clock) or Dijon (the clock taken by Philippe le Hardy from Courtrai in 1382), have either been lost, destroyed, or substantially modified. The Wells Cathedral clock might have been made by the same craftsmen as the Salisbury clock, but is usually dated to around 1392, and is now relocated in the Science Museum in London, where it continues to operate.\u000aThere are some doubts that the clock displayed in Salisbury Cathedral is actually the clock mentioned in 1386, as the construction is quite advanced and more comparable to clocks made in the 16th and 17th century than those made in the 14th century. The question if this is the 1386 clock is quite important as the Wells Cathedral clock was previously dated in the 16th century, but then dated 1392 after the discovery of the Salisbury clock in 1928. Dating mistakes for old turret clocks are not uncommon. The Dover Castle clock was initially dated in the 14th century, only to be later revised to around 1600.\u000aIn 1993, Christopher McKay organised a symposium with the Antiquarian Horological Society to determine if the clock could be dated to 1386. The majority of participants voted for it to be the original, but roughly 1/3 of participants voted the clock to be of a much later date.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe clock was re-discovered in 1928, set aside in the cathedral tower. At that time it had a pendulum, which appeared to have been installed at a later date, replacing a verge and foliot. The clock was restored in 1956, and a reproduction verge and foliot were installed. There were no drawings or documents available, and it is possible that the original foliot and verge escapement did not look exactly like the one now installed in the clock.\u000aThe striking train of the clock is believed to be original.\u000aLike many of these more practical devices, its main purpose was to strike a bell at precise times. It probably did not have a dial. The wheels and gears are mounted in a four-post wrought iron frame. The framework is held together with metal wedged tenons. rather than with nuts and bolts (which had not been invented).\u000aAs found, the escapement was a pendulum - which must have been a replacement as it is too early for clocks of this age, which would have had verge and foliot. The power was supplied by two large stone weights. As the weights descend, ropes unwind from the wooden barrels. One barrel drives the going train which is regulated by the escapement, the other drives the striking train the speed of which is regulated by the fly (air brake).\u000aBefore the weights reach the floor, they have to be wound back up again, a task that explains the presence of two large wheels shaped like steering wheels at either end of the clock.\u000aThe clock is now a "single strike" clock that strikes only on the hour. It makes one strike per hour of the day (e.g. one strike at noon). The left half of the clock (as in the photograph above), is the striking train; the right half is the going train. When it was built, it may have simply struck bells for the masses - which were up to four.\u000aAt the end of the 17th century, the Salisbury clock, like many others, was modified from verge and foliot to pendulum and anchor operation. This usually made clocks much more accurate, even though trials in the early 1990s by Michael Maltin showed that the clock was running to within two minutes a day if the rope on the barrel was kept in a single layer. As soon as there are two layers, there is more torque applied to the barrel by the weight and the clock will go faster. As a single layer of winding is enough to keep the clock going for 12 hours, it could have been kept exact to within 2 minutes per day if it had been wound twice per day.\u000aIn 1790, the old bell tower 'on the ditch of the close of the canons of the said church' mentioned in the deed of 1386 which had housed the clock was demolished, so the clock was moved to the Cathedral's central tower. In 1884, a new clock was installed and the old one was left to the side.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Revival ==\u000aThe clock was re-discovered in the tower in 1928 by T.R. Robinson, an horological enthusiast who went up the clock tower to see the new clock (installed in 1884). The presence of the old clock was known to many, but nobody attributed much importance to the old clock. It was only T.R. Robinson who believed that it was the clock mentioned in 1386. From photos taken in 1928, it looked to be fairly complete. Eventually its historic importance was realised. It was first put on display in the Cathedral's North transept. Then, in 1956, the clock was restored to its original condition and started working again. The pendulum and recoil escapement were replaced by a new verge and foliot escapement, thus restoring the clock to something like its original design.\u000aToday, the escapement operates, but the striking mechanism is normally prevented from running by a clamp, which may be removed for demonstration purposes..\u000a\u000a\u000a== 1956 restoration ==\u000aMessrs. John Smith & Sons of Derby received the clock in February 1956. It was taken apart for the transport. They reassembled the clock in their workshop and compared it to existing clocks in the Science Museum before deciding how to restore it.\u000aThe help of Rolls Royce was enlisted to have X-ray photographs of two of the wheel arbors taken. This confirmed that the two arbors of the going train had been lengthened when the clock had been converted to pendulum operation. Subsequent investigations revealed that the clock had actually been converted twice, as remains of an earlier pendulum escapement were discovered.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Technical details ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Frame ===\u000aThe frame height is 1.24m, the width 1.29m, and the depth 1.06m.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Going train ===\u000a\u000aGreat wheel to verge escape wheel: 100 to 10, verge escape wheel 45 teeth.\u000aThe Great wheel turns once in 3600 seconds (1 hour), so the verge escape wheel turns once in 360 seconds. One full foliot swing thus takes 8 seconds, or 4 seconds per half swing.\u000aSeen from the going train side, the great wheel with the winding barrel turns anti-clockwise, and the escapement wheel turns clockwise.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Striking train ===\u000a\u000aGreat wheel to fly: 64 teeth driving an 8 pin birdcage; second (hoop) wheel 64 teeth driving an 8 leaf pinion on the fly. So each turn of the great wheel makes the fly turn 64 times, or 8 turns of the fly per strike of the clock (as the great wheel has 8 striking pins).\u000aGreat wheel to count wheel: 8 tooth pinion to internal 78 teeth on count wheel, with 8 striking pins on the great wheel. This directly corresponds with the 78 strikes the clock will make in 12 hours (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 78). The count wheel turns once every 12 hours, so the great wheel turns 9.75 times, operating the strike lever thus 9.75 × 8 = 78 times.\u000aSeen from the striking train side, the great wheel with the winding barrel turns clockwise, the hoop wheel anti-clockwise, the count wheel clockwise, and the fly clockwise.\u000aOne peculiarity of this clock is that the count wheel only appears to have 11 notches, but the clock strikes 12 times each complete turn. This is because the first strike (when the clock strikes one) is executed whilst the lever is still within the first, wider, notch. The locking piece is lifted out of the hoop of the hoop wheel, which then turns once, which leads to the great wheel turning 1/8 and striking once. Then the locking piece falls back into the hoop wheel. The fly will continue to turn until it stops gently on his own as it has a ratchet mechanism, which protects the bird cage on the fly arbor.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aRichard of Wallingford\u000aDating the Salisbury cathedral clock

aVThe Greater Richmond Transit Company, known locally as GRTC Transit System, is a local government-owned public service company which operates an urban-suburban bus line based in Richmond, Virginia.\u000aGRTC primarily serves the independent city of Richmond and a very small portion of the adjacent counties of Henrico and Chesterfield with a fleet of over 175 diesel-powered and CNG-powered transit buses operating approximately 59 routes.\u000aGRTC uses government-funded equipment and resources principally provided by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation (VDRPT), and local funds. It also maintains equipment and has other affiliations with Petersburg Area Transit, a similar agency which also serves a portion of Chesterfield County.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Ownership and management ==\u000aAs a public service company, GRTC is owned equally by the City of Richmond and neighboring Chesterfield County. Henrico County currently purchases services from it, but holds no ownership interest.\u000aIt is managed by a private transit management company that provides the CEO, COO, and Transportation Manager, as was its predecessor, Virginia Transit Company (VTC). GRTC itself has 400 employees.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ownership history ===\u000aIn 1860, Richmond Railway was organized, beginning operations in August. The service was forced to stop for nearly 2 years during the Civil War.\u000aIn 1866, Joseph Jackson, Jr., acquired control and resumed operations.\u000aIn 1881, it was sold to Richmond City Railway Company.\u000aIn 1887, The Richmond City Council adopted an ordinance granting a franchise to the Richmond Union Passenger Railway Company to operate a street railway system. Ground was broken for laying rail.\u000aIn 1888, Frank Sprague installed a complete system of electric streetcars in Richmond, Virginia. This was the first large scale and successful use of electricity to run a city's entire system of streetcars. Operation of streetcars continued until they were totally replaced by buses in 1949.\u000aIn 1925, Virginia Railway and Power company bought the transit system.\u000aIn 1944, the Securities and Exchange Commission directed Virginia Electric and Power company to confine its activities to the electricity business.\u000aIn 1944, the Richmond transit bus system (and a similar one in Norfolk) was purchased by VTC, which became part of the United Transit Company the next year. After World War II, public transit systems in the United States became unprofitable, and most were eventually converted to government-owned and funded operations. This trend included Virginia Transit Company operations in Richmond and Norfolk.\u000aIn 1947, the Main Street and Westhampton streetcar lines are motorized. Virginia Transit Company began conversion to motor buses.\u000aIn 1949, Buses replace electric trolleys. On November 25, 1949, ten streetcars make the last run.\u000aIn 1962, American Transportation Enterprises, Inc., acquired controlling interest in United Transit Company.\u000aIn 1972, federal, state and local funds were used to purchase the assets of the Virginia Transit Company, and a new public service company was set up, GRTC, which was wholly owned by the City of Richmond. A one-half interest was later purchased by Chesterfield County in the late 1980s.

aVIn probability theory and statistics, the beta-binomial distribution is a family of discrete probability distributions on a finite support of non-negative integers arising when the probability of success in each of a fixed or known number of Bernoulli trials is either unknown or random. The beta-binomial distribution is the binomial distribution in which the probability of success at each trial is not fixed but random and follows the beta distribution. It is frequently used in Bayesian statistics, empirical Bayes methods and classical statistics to capture overdispersion in binomial type distributed data.\u000aIt reduces to the Bernoulli distribution as a special case when n = 1. For \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 1, it is the discrete uniform distribution from 0 to n. It also approximates the binomial distribution arbitrarily well for large \u03b1 and \u03b2. The beta-binomial is a one-dimensional version of the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution, as the binomial and beta distributions are univariate versions of the multinomial and Dirichlet distributions, respectively.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Motivation and derivation ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== As a compound distribution ===\u000aThe Beta distribution is a conjugate distribution of the binomial distribution.

also be motivated via an urn model for positive integer values of \u03b1 and \u03b2, known as the Polya urn model. Specifically, imagine an urn containing \u03b1 red balls and \u03b2 black balls, where random draws are made. If a red ball is observed, then two red balls are returned to the urn. Likewise, if a black ball is drawn, then two black balls are returned to the urn. If this is repeated n times, then the probability of observing k red balls follows a beta-binomial distribution with parameters n,\u03b1 and \u03b2.\u000aNote that if the random draws are with simple replacement (no balls over and above the observed ball are added to the urn), then the distribution follows a binomial distribution and if the random draws are made without replacement, the distribution follows a hypergeometric distribution.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Moments and properties ==\u000aThe first three raw moments are\u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a

underdispersed relative to the binomial distribution. In this case, the binomial distribution and the hypergeometric distribution are alternative candidates respectively.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Maximum likelihood estimation ===\u000aWhile closed-form maximum likelihood estimates are impractical, given that the pdf consists of common functions (gamma function and/or Beta functions), they can be easily found via direct numerical optimization. Maximum likelihood estimates from empirical data can be computed using general methods for fitting multinomial Pólya distributions, methods for which are described in (Minka 2003). The R package VGAM through the function vglm, via maximum likelihood, facilitates the fitting of glm type models with responses distributed according to the beta-binomial distribution. Note also that there is no requirement that n is fixed throughout the observations.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Example ===\u000aThe following data gives the number of male children among the first 12 children of family size 13 in 6115 families taken from hospital records in 19th century Saxony (Sokal and Rohlf, p. 59 from Lindsey). The 13th child is ignored to assuage the effect of families non-randomly stopping when a desired gender is reached.\u000aWe note the first two sample moments are\u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          \u000a            \u000a              \u000a                \u000a                  m\u000a                  \u000a                    1\u000a                  \u000a                \u000a              \u000a              \u000a                \u000a                =\u000a                6.23\u000a              \u000a            \u000a            \u000a              \u000a                \u000a                  m\u000a                  \u000a                    2\u000a                  \u000a                \u000a              \u000a              \u000a                \u000a                =\u000a                42.31\u000a              \u000a            \u000a            \u000a              \u000a                n\u000a              \u000a              \u000a                \u000a                =\u000a                12\u000a              \u000a            \u000a          \u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle {\u005cbegin{aligned}m_{1}&=6.23\u005c\u005cm_{2}&=42.31\u005c\u005cn&=12\u005cend{aligned}}}\u000a  \u000a\u000aand therefore the method of moments estimates are\u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          \u000a            \u000a              \u000a                \u000a                  \u000a                    \u000a                      \u03b1\u000a                      ^\u000a                    \u000a                  \u000a                \u000a              \u000a              \u000a                \u000a                =\u000a                34.1350\u000a              \u000a            \u000a            \u000a              \u000a                \u000a                  \u000a                    \u000a                      \u03b2\u000a                      ^\u000a                    \u000a                  \u000a                \u000a              \u000a              \u000a                \u000a                =\u000a                31.6085.\u000a              \u000a            \u000a          \u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle {\u005cbegin{aligned}{\u005chat {\u005calpha }}&=34.1350\u005c\u005c{\u005chat {\u005cbeta }}&=31.6085.\u005cend{aligned}}}\u000a  \u000a\u000aThe maximum likelihood estimates can be found numerically\u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          \u000a            \u000a              \u000a                \u000a                  \u000a                    \u000a                      \u000a                        \u03b1\u000a                        ^\u000a                      \u000a                    \u000a                  \u000a                  \u000a                    \u000a                      m\u000a                      l\u000a                      e\u000a                    \u000a                  \u000a                \u000a              \u000a              \u000a                \u000a                =\u000a                34.09558\u000a              \u000a            \u000a            \u000a              \u000a                \u000a                  \u000a                    \u000a                      \u000a                        \u03b2\u000a                        ^\u000a                      \u000a                    \u000a                  \u000a                  \u000a                    \u000a                      m\u000a                      l\u000a                      e\u000a                    \u000a                  \u000a                \u000a              \u000a              \u000a                \u000a                =\u000a                31.5715\u000a              \u000a            \u000a          \u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle {\u005cbegin{aligned}{\u005chat {\u005calpha }}_{\u005cmathrm {mle} }&=34.09558\u005c\u005c{\u005chat {\u005cbeta }}_{\u005cmathrm {mle} }&=31.5715\u005cend{aligned}}}\u000a  \u000a\u000aand the maximized log-likelihood is\u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        log\u000a        \u2061\u000a        \u000a          \u000a            L\u000a          \u000a        \u000a        =\u000a        \u2212\u000a        12492.9\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005clog {\u005cmathcal {L}}=-12492.9}\u000a  \u000a\u000afrom which we find the AIC\u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          \u000a            A\u000a            I\u000a            C\u000a          \u000a        \u000a        =\u000a        24989.74.\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle {\u005cmathit {AIC}}=24989.74.}\u000a  \u000a\u000aThe AIC for the competing binomial model is AIC = 25070.34 and thus we see that the beta-binomial model provides a superior fit to the data i.e. there is evidence for overdispersion.

aVDaniel "Dan" Shanahan (born 4 January 1977) is an Irish hurling selector and former player. He has been a selector with the Waterford senior team since 2013.\u000aBorn in Lismore, County Waterford, Shanahan was introduced to hurling by his father, a former hurler with Waterford. He was a Harty Cup runner-up with Lismore CBS while simultaneously enjoying championship successes at senior level with the Lismore club.\u000aShanahan made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Waterford minor team. A two-time Munster runner-up in this grade, he later lined out with the under-21 team. Shanahan joined the senior team in 1995. He went on to play a key role for Waterford in attack during a hugely successful era, and won four Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion.\u000aShanahan represented the Munster inter-provincial team at various times throughout his career, winning one Railway Cup medal in 2007. At club level he won one championship medal with Lismore.\u000aThroughout his career Shanahan made 52 championship appearances for Waterford. His tally of 21-58 marks him out as Waterford's fourth highest scorer of all-time, while he is the all-time leading goal-scorer for Waterford. Shanahan announced his inter-county retirement on 18 August 2010.\u000aShanahan is widely regarded as one of Waterford's greatest hurlers. During his career he won three All-Star awards, while in 2007 he was named Texaco, All-Star and GPA Hurler of the Year.\u000aHis brother, Maurice, is a current member of the Waterford senior team.And former teammate, Eoin Kelly is his cousin\u000aIn retirement from playing, Shanahan became involved in team management and coaching. In October 2013 he became part of Derek McGrath's management team to the Waterford senior hurlers.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Playing career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Club ===\u000aShanahan plays his club hurling with the Lismore club in Waterford and has enjoyed much success.\u000aHe has enjoyed some success at underage levels winning county medals in hurling at under-14, under-16, minor and under-21 levels. Shanahan was only sixteen years-old when he won a senior county club championship in 1993 following a one-point defeat of Passage. The following years proved to be somewhat frustrating for Shanahan and Lismore. Ballygunner and Mount Sion both had very strong teams and dominated the county scene for a number of years. Despite having a depth of talent within their ranks, Lismore were unable to win another county title in this period, going very close on a number of occasions most notably in the 1996, 2001 and 2009 county finals. In 2016 and at 39 years old, Shanahan finally captured another county medal, this time in the intermediate grade. This win was followed by Lismore winning the Munster Intermediate championship with a victory over Kerry side Kilmoyley.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Inter-county ===\u000aShanahan's inter-county career began with the Waterford minor and under-21 teams. He was a member of the Waterford team that reached the Munster minor final in 1994. However, Cork ran out comfortable winners. The following year Shanahan and Waterford were back in the Munster final against the same opposition, and once again it was the Cork men who emerged victorious. He was also a member of the Lismore CBS side that reached the Harty cup final the same year. A star studded Midleton CBS outfit were the opposition, and despite Shanahan being amongst the goals, it was the east Cork school who took home the cup.\u000aHe joined the Waterford senior team in 1995, however, he didn't make his senior championship debut until 1998. That year Waterford held All-Ireland champions Clare to a draw in the Munster final, however, the Decies lost the replay. Shanahan\u2019s side later faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final in what would be the county's first appearance in Croke Park since 1963. Kilkenny won by a single point.\u000aIn 2002 Waterford emerged from the doldrums by reaching the Munster final once again, however, Shanahan could not command a definite place on the starting fifteen. In spite of this he came on as a substitute to claim his first Munster winners' medal as Waterford defeated Tipperary by 2-23 to 3-12. It was their first provincial crown in thirty-nine years.\u000aAfter surrendering the Munster title to Cork in 2003, Shanahan's side were back in the provincial showpiece for a third successive year in 2004. He was by now a regular on the starting fifteen. In one of the greatest games of all-time Waterford defeated Cork in a Munster final for the first time in forty-five years to take the title by 3-16 to 1-21. An All-Ireland appearance subsequently eluded the team yet again. In spite of this there was some consolation at the end of the year as Shanahan's scoring prowess earned him his first All-Star award.\u000aThe following few years proved difficult for Shanahan. Waterford crashed out of the early stages of the provincial championship in 2005 and 2006. On both these occasions his team was defeated by Cork in the All-Ireland series. He did, however, win a second All-Star award in 2006.\u000aIn 2007 Shanahan added a National Hurling League medal to his collection when Waterford defeated Kilkenny by 0-20 to 0-18 in the final. He later claimed a third Munster winners' medal as Waterford defeated Limerick by 3-17 to 1-14 in the provincial decider. Shanahan himself scored a hat-trick of goals in the second half. While Waterford were viewed as possibly going on and winning the All-Ireland title for the first time in almost half a century, Limerick ambushed Waterford in the All-Ireland semi-final. In spite of falling short of championship success Shanahan\u2019s tally of eight goals over the whole championship marked him out as one of the best forwards in the country. He was later presented with a third All-Star award as well as claiming the Vodafone Hurler of the Year award. Shanahan later made a clean sweep of all the player of the year awards by also collecting the GPA Hurler of the Year and Texaco Hurler of the Year awards as well.\u000a2008 began with Waterford losing their opening game to Clare as well as their manager Justin McCarthy. In spite of this poor start Shanahan's side reached the All-Ireland final for the first time in forty-five years. Kilkenny provided the opposition and went on to defeat Waterford by 3-30 to 1-13 to claim a third All-Ireland title in-a-row.\u000aShanahan was relegated to the subs' bench in 2010 as Waterford faced Cork in another Munster final. A 2-15 apiece draw was the result on that occasion, however, Waterford went on to win the replay after an extra-time goal by Shanahan. It was a fourth Munster winners' medal for Shanahan, a record that he shares with five other Waterford players.\u000aIn August 2010 he announced his retirement from the inter-county game after Waterford's exit to Tipperary in the All Ireland semi final.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Inter-provincial ===\u000aShanahan was also a veteran of five inter-provincial championship campaigns with Munster. He first lined out with his province in 1998, however, he did not capture a winners medal in this competition until 2007 when Munster defeated Connacht by 2-22 to 2-19.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Honours ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Team ===\u000aLismore\u000aWaterford Senior Club Hurling Championship (1): 1993\u000aWaterford Intermediate Hurling Championship (1): 2016\u000aMunster Intermediate Club Hurling Championship (1): 2016\u000aWaterford\u000aMunster Senior Hurling Championship (4): 2002, 2004, 2007, 2010\u000aNational Hurling League (1): 2007\u000aMunster\u000aInter-provincial Championship (1): 2007\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Individual ===\u000aAll-Stars: 3\u000a2004, 2006, 2007\u000a\u000aTexaco Hurler of the Year: 1\u000a2007\u000a\u000aAll-Stars Hurler of the Year: 1\u000a2007\u000a\u000aGPA Hurler of the Year: 1\u000a2007\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVMoby Grape is an American rock group from the 1960s, known for having all five members contribute to singing and songwriting and that collectively merged elements of folk music, blues, country, and jazz, together with rock and psychedelic music. They were one of the few groups of which all members were lead vocalists. The group continues to perform occasionally.\u000aMoby Grape's success was significantly impeded by decades-long legal disputes with their former manager, Matthew Katz. Legal difficulties originated shortly after the group's formation, when Katz insisted that an additional provision be added to his management contract, giving him ownership of the group name. At the time, various group members were indebted to Katz, who had been paying for apartments and various living costs prior to the group releasing its first album. Despite objecting, group members signed, based in part on an impression that there would be no further financial support from Katz unless they did so. Neil Young, then of Buffalo Springfield, was in the room at the time, and kept his head down, playing his guitar, and saying nothing. According to Peter Lewis, "I think Neil knew, even then, that this was the end. We had bought into this process that we should have known better than to buy into."\u000aThe dispute with Katz became more acute after the group members' rights to their songs, as well as their own name, were signed away in 1973, in a settlement made without their knowledge between Katz and Moby Grape's then manager (and former producer), David Rubinson. It was also a settlement made at a time when Bob Mosley and Skip Spence were generally recognized as being legally incapacitated from the effects of schizophrenia.\u000aAs described by Jeff Tamarkin, "The Grape's saga is one of squandered potential, absurdly misguided decisions, bad luck, blunders and excruciating heartbreak, all set to the tune of some of the greatest rock and roll ever to emerge from San Francisco. Moby Grape could have had it all, but they ended up with nothing, and less."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1966\u20131967 ===\u000aThe group was formed in late 1966 in San Francisco, at the instigation of Skip Spence and Matthew Katz. Both had been previously associated with Jefferson Airplane, Spence as the band's first drummer, playing on their first album, Jefferson Airplane Takes Off, and Katz as the band's manager, but both had been dismissed by the group. Katz encouraged Spence to form a band similar to Jefferson Airplane, with varied songwriting and vocal work by several group members, and with Katz as the manager. According to band member Peter Lewis, "Matthew (Katz) brought the spirit of conflict into the band. He didn't want it to be an equal partnership. He wanted it all."\u000aThe band name, judicially determined to have been chosen by Bob Mosley and Spence, came from the punch line of the joke "What's purple and swims?". Lead guitarist Jerry Miller and drummer Don Stevenson (both formerly of The Frantics, originally based in Seattle) joined guitarist (and son of actress Loretta Young) Peter Lewis (of The Cornells), bassist Bob Mosley (of The Misfits, based in San Diego), and Spence, now on guitar instead of drums. Jerry Miller and Don Stevenson had moved The Frantics from Seattle to San Francisco after a 1965 meeting with Jerry Garcia, then playing with The Warlocks at a bar in Belmont, California. Garcia encouraged them to move to San Francisco. Once The Frantics were settled in San Francisco, Mosley joined the band.\u000aWhile Jerry Miller was the principal lead guitarist, all three guitarists played lead at various points, often playing off against each other, in a guitar form associated with Moby Grape as "crosstalk". The other major three-guitar band at the time was Buffalo Springfield. Moby Grape's music has been described by Geoffrey Parr as follows: "No rock and roll group has been able to use a guitar trio as effectively as Moby Grape did on Moby Grape. Spence played a distinctive rhythm guitar that really sticks out throughout the album. Lewis, meanwhile, was a very good guitar player overall and was excellent at finger picking, as is evident in several songs. And then there is Miller, "The way they crafted their parts and played together on Moby Grape is like nothing else I've ever heard in my life. The guitars are like a collage of sound that makes perfect sense."\u000aAll band members wrote songs and sang lead and backup vocals for their debut album Moby Grape (1967). Mosley, Lewis, and Spence generally wrote alone, while Miller and Stevenson generally wrote together. In 2003, Moby Grape was ranked as number 121 in Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". Noted rock critic Robert Christgau listed it as one of The 40 "Essential Albums of 1967". In 2008, Skip Spence's song "Omaha", from the first Moby Grape album, was listed as number 95 in Rolling Stone's "100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time". The song was described as follows:\u000a\u000aOn their best single, Jerry Miller, Peter Lewis and Skip Spence compete in a three-way guitar battle for two and a quarter red-hot minutes, each of them charging at Spence's song from different angles, no one yielding to anyone else."\u000a\u000aIn a marketing stunt, Columbia Records immediately released five singles at once, and the band was perceived as being over-hyped. This was during a period in which mainstream record labels were giving previously unheard-of levels of promotion to what was then considered counter-cultural music genres. Nonetheless, the record was critically acclaimed and fairly successful commercially, with The Move covering the album's "Hey Grandma" (a Miller-Stevenson composition) on their eponymous first album. More recently, "Hey Grandma" was included in the soundtrack to the 2005 Sean Penn-Nicole Kidman film, The Interpreter, as well as being covered in 2009 by the Black Crowes, on Warpaint Live. Spence's "Omaha" was the only one of the five singles to chart, reaching number 88 in 1967. Miller-Stevenson's "8:05" became a country rock standard (covered by Robert Plant, Guy Burlage, and others).\u000aOne of Moby Grape's earliest major onstage performances was the Mantra-Rock Dance\u2014a musical event held on January 29, 1967 at the Avalon Ballroom by the San Francisco Hare Krishna temple. At the event Moby Grape performed along with the Hare Krishna founder Bhaktivedanta Swami, Allen Ginsberg, Grateful Dead, and Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, donating proceeds to the temple. The group appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival on Saturday, June 17, 1967. Due to legal and managerial disputes, the group was not included in the D.A. Pennebaker-produced film of the event, Monterey Pop. Moby Grape's Monterey recordings and film remain unreleased, allegedly because Matthew Katz demanded one million dollars for the rights. According to Peter Lewis, "[Katz] told Lou Adler they had to pay us a million bucks to film us at the Monterey Pop Festival. So instead of putting us on Saturday night right before Otis Redding, they wound up putting us on at sunset on Friday when there was nobody in the place." \u000aThe Moby Grape footage was shown in 2007 as part of the 40th anniversary celebrations of the film. Jerry Miller recalls that Laura Nyro was given Moby Grape's original position opening for Otis Redding, "because everybody was arguing. Nobody wanted to play first and I said that would be fine for me." In addition to the marketing backlash, band members found themselves in legal trouble for charges (later dropped) of consorting with underage females, and the band's relationship with their manager rapidly deteriorated.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1968 ===\u000aThe second album, Wow/Grape Jam, released in 1968, was generally viewed as a critical and commercial disappointment, even though the album charted at No. 20 on the Billboard Pop Albums charts, partially due to the special low price double-album packaging. Though Wow added strings and horns to some songs, their basic sound remained consistent from the debut album, featuring tight harmonies, multiple guitars, imaginative songwriting, and a strong level of musicianship. The album included the track "Just Like Gene Autry, a Foxtrot", a tribute to the ballroom music big band era which was tracked to only be played back properly at the speed of 78 RPM. The Grape Jam LP was one of loose improvised studio jams with outside musicians; this detracted from the stronger tunes on Wow, such as the room-shaking shuffle "Can't Be So Bad." Also in 1968, the band contributed to the soundtrack of the movie The Sweet Ride, and appeared, credited, in the film.\u000aThe band was also introduced to a wide group of UK listeners in 1968 through the inclusion of "Can't Be So Bad", from the Wow album, on the iconic sampler album The Rock Machine Turns You On (CBS).\u000aBut, amidst this success, troubled times plagued the band when founding member Spence began abusing LSD, which led to increasingly erratic behavior. According to Miller: "Skippy changed radically when we were in New York. There were some people there (he met) who were into harder drugs and a harder lifestyle, and some very weird shit. And so he kind of flew off with those people. Skippy kind of disappeared for a little while. Next time we saw him, he had cut off his beard, and was wearing a black leather jacket, with his chest hanging out, with some chains and just sweating like a son of a gun. I don't know what the hell he got a hold of, man, but it just whacked him. And the next thing I know, he axed my door down in the Albert Hotel. They said at the reception area that this crazy guy had held an ax to the doorman's head."  After spending time in the infamous Tombs jail in New York, Spence was committed to New York's Bellevue Hospital, where he spent six months under psychiatric care.\u000aRecalling this troubled time for Spence, Peter Lewis said, "We had to do (the album) in New York because the producer (David Rubinson) wanted to be with his family. So we had to leave our families and spend months at a time in hotel rooms in New York City. Finally I just quit and went back to California. I got a phone call after a couple of days. They'd played a Fillmore East gig without me, and Skippy took off with some black witch afterward who fed him full of acid. It was like that scene in The Doors movie. He thought he was the anti-Christ. He tried to chop down the hotel room door with a fire axe to kill Don [Stevenson] to save him from himself. He went up to the 52nd floor of the CBS building where they had to wrestle him to the ground. And Rubinson pressed charges against him. They took him to the Tombs (and then to Bellevue) and that's where he wrote Oar. When he got out of there, he cut that album in Nashville. And that was the end of his career. They shot him full of Thorazine for six months. They just take you out of the game."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1969\u20131970 ===\u000aAfter the forced departure of Spence, the remaining four members continued recording throughout 1968 and released Moby Grape '69 in January 1969. Spence's "Seeing" (also known as "Skip's Song") was finished by the foursome, and it is one of the highlights. Despite the collaborative effort to complete the song, the songwriting credit was left solely with Spence. After a tour of the UK and Holland in February 1969 (the band toured as a 4 piece, minus Skip Spence) Bob Mosley then left the group, shocking the remaining members by joining the Marines. The remaining three released their final album for Columbia, Truly Fine Citizen, in late 1969, with session bassist Bob Moore filling in for the departed Mosley during the sessions for the album. Truly Fine Citizen would be the final work conducted by the band prior to their initial dissolution.\u000aMiller and Stevenson then formed The Rhythm Dukes, later joined by Bill Champlin. The band achieved a degree of success as a second-billed act during much of the latter part of 1969 to 1971, plus recorded one album, which was ultimately released in 2005.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1970s\u20131980s ===\u000aIn 1971, the original five members reunited and, along with violinist Gordon Stevens, recorded 20 Granite Creek for Reprise Records. Prior to Spence once again departing and the group breaking up, the group performed a few concerts to support the album, most notably, during the last days of the Fillmore East. These concerts were described by contemporary accounts as disastrous, and circulating recordings do little to challenge that assessment. These shows are noteworthy, however, due to their inclusion of original material that did not appear on their albums proper. Mosley contributed "When You're Down The Road" and "Just A Woman", Lewis "There Is No Reason", and Spence brought along a song referred to as "We Don't Know Now" (a misinterpretation of Miller on an audience recording telling them that they were "going to do Omaha now" before launching into the song) and "Sailing", a song which would be all but forgotten until Spence performed it with Moby Grape at a 1996 gig near Spence's home in Santa Cruz, California, at the Palookaville nightclub. They also performed songs cut for "20 Granite Creek". A Fillmore East gig saw Mosley doing an a capella rendition of "Ode To The Man At The End of The Bar".\u000aFollowing the departure of Spence, and the band's consequent dissolution, the band reformed several times over the following years; featuring different combinations of the members. In 1973, Lewis, Miller, and Mosley reformed the band for some live shows; with guitarist Jeff Blackburn and drummer Johnny Craviotto filling the roles vacated by Spence and Stevenson. Following the end of the shows in 1975, Miller, Mosley, and Craviotto were joined by Michael Been (later of The Call), under the name Fine Wine, and recorded an LP under the same name on Polydor Records in Germany in 1976. Following the end of Fine Wine, Mosley and Craviotto joined with Jeff Blackburn and Neil Young to form The Ducks, which played in and around the Santa Cruz area during 1977, and were immensely popular during the band's brief life; whilst Miller and Been went on to form The Original Haze", also originating around the Santa Cruz area, before joining Lewis and Spence in another reformation of Moby Grape; this time joined by keyboardist/sax Cornelius Bumpus, drummers John Oxendine and Daniel Spencer, and bassist Chris Powell. The band released 1978's Live Grape album before again splitting in 1979.\u000aThe eighties saw the band reform again on two occasions; firstly in 1983 with a line-up consisting of Lewis, Miller, Mosley, and Stevenson, which released the Moby Grape '84 album before dissolving in 1984. Then, in February 1987, the full original line-up of Moby Grape, along with It's a Beautiful Day, Fraternity of Man, and the Strawberry Alarm Clock, got together for a couple of shows. They performed their classics "Hey Grandma," "Naked, If I Want To," "Omaha," "Fall on You," and "8:05," among others, before fans at the Marin Civic and Cupertino\u2019s DeAnza College. Notwithstanding continuing to perform on occasion, the group has never returned to the level of popularity enjoyed in the early Avalon Ballroom/Fillmore Auditorium days. Following these shows Spence departed the band (for the final time), and his role within the group was filled by Dan Abernathy for recording and touring purposes.\u000aDue to continued legal battle between the band and Matthew Katz over ownership of the "Moby Grape" name, other names were used during this period for performance or recording purposes; including Mosley Grape, Legendary Grape, Maby Grope, the previously used Fine Wine, and The Melvilles. This led to the band's 1989 Legendary Grape album being considered by some to be a Melvilles recording, as, while it was originally issued as a Moby Grape cassette-only release, the tape eventually had to be withdrawn due to pressure from Katz's legal team; and it was subsequently repackaged and reissued as being by The Melvilles. Despite Jerry Miller, Bob Mosley and Peter Lewis continuing to release solo records in the 1990s and 2000s, Moby Grape has not released an album of new material since the release of Legendary Grape in 1989. Jerry Miller considers the 2003 remastered and supplemented CD version of Legendary Grape to be an essential Moby Grape album.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1990s\u20132000s ===\u000aThe debut album and Wow/Grape Jam were first released on CD during the late 1980s by the San Francisco Sound label, a company owned by their former manager, Matthew Katz. These releases suffer from mediocre sound and poor quality packaging. It is also contended that Moby Grape has never been properly compensated for recordings released by this label. The 2 CD 1993 Legacy Recordings compilation Vintage: The Very Best of Moby Grape includes their entire first album and most of Moby Grape '69, selected tracks from Wow and Truly Fine Citizen, as well as studio outtakes and alternate versions, in much better quality. This compilation attracted new attention to the band and helped to re-introduce their music to a new audience. In 1994, the group members commenced an action against Matthew Katz, Sony Music Entertainment and Columbia Records (Sony being the successor corporation to CBS Records), seeking to have the settlement overturned. This settlement from 1973 meant that the group members would receive no royalties whatsoever from the well-regarded Vintage: The Best of Moby Grape, which Sony had released as part of its Legacy Records series in 1993. Production of the Vintage collection soon ceased.\u000aThe band had folded again in 1991 due to the deteriorating emotional state of Bob Mosley; who ultimately ended up being homeless in San Diego. This led Lewis, Miller, and Stevenson to regroup with Mosley and reform the band in 1996 as a means to help him resolve his problems; with health problems preventing Skip Spence from also joining the band. Spence lived in a residential care facility in northern California, and despite an extended period of homelessness and suffering from mental illness, there was a marked improvement in his domestic life in his later years before he died from lung cancer in 1999, two days before his 53rd birthday.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2000s\u2013present ===\u000aAmid the ongoing legal proceedings between Moby Grape and Katz, the surviving members of the band decided to dissolve the group once again in 2001. Finally, in 2006, and after three decades of court battles, the band finally won back its name; and subsequently reformed. To celebrate, in September 2007, a reunited Moby Grape performed for over 40,000 fans at the Summer of Love 40th Anniversary Celebration in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. In October 2007, Sundazed Records reissued the Grape's first five albums (with bonus tracks) on CD and vinyl. The following month, the label was forced to both withdraw and recall Moby Grape, Wow and Grape Jam from print on both vinyl and CD because of a new lawsuit by former manager Katz. Sundazed stated on their website that they were directed to withdraw the three titles by Sony BMG (inheritors of the band's original label, Columbia), from whom Sundazed had licensed the recordings. Following the reunion performance, Stevenson departed the band and semi-retired from the music industry. Moby Grape continues to perform occasionally, performing with core members Jerry Miller, Bob Mosley and Peter Lewis, and in such incarnations as with Skip Spence's son Omar joining on vocals and Jerry Miller's son Joseph on drums. New recording commenced in 2009, following the release of The Place and the Time, a well-received collection of demos, outtakes, alternate versions and otherwise unreleased material from the band's 1960s recording period.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Later releases ===\u000aSubsequent to the withdrawal of Vintage, Sony released Cross Talk: The Best of Moby Grape (2004), followed by Listen My Friends! The Best of Moby Grape (2007). Legendary Grape was issued for the first time in CD by Dig Music in 2003. In 2009, Sundazed Music issued The Place and the Time, a two disc collection of alternate takes, live versions and other previously unreleased material. In February 2010 Sundazed released the First Official Live Moby Grape 'Live' Album on Vinyl and Compact Disc formats.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Tribute albums ===\u000aMoby Grape has been the subject of five fan-initiated tribute albums, whereby Moby Grape songs are covered by fans of the band. The series commenced with Mo'Grape (2000) and Even Mo'Grape (2002) and has been followed by Still Mo' Grape, Forever Mo and Just Say Mo.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Work outside of Moby Grape ==\u000aOf the four surviving band members, all but Don Stevenson still perform to a regular degree.\u000aPeter Lewis released a debut CD in 1995 and formed an acoustic duo with David West (released Live in Bremen, 2003). Lewis also spent three years (2000\u20132003) as a guitarist with the reformed Electric Prunes, contributing to the band's Artifact album (2002).\u000aJerry Miller appears as both a solo artist and as a member of the Jerry Miller Band, and plays regularly in the Washington State area.\u000aBob Mosley's relocation to the Santa Cruz area has been noteworthy for weekly guest appearances with veteran country artist Larry Hosford, a stalwart of the Santa Cruz music scene, and in occasional duos with ex-Doobie Brothers keyboardist Dale Ockerman. Don Stevenson, who has rejoined Moby Grape for occasional performances, has developed business interests outside of the music industry, including time share sales of recreational property in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, where he maintains a residence.\u000aIn 2010, Don Stevenson, Jerry Miller and Omar Spence performed at the South by Southwest music festival (the performance at the Dirty Dog was recorded by Eric Sigsbey), while Peter Lewis appeared separately.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personnel ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Members ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Line-ups ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discography ==\u000aContains Billboard (BB) and Cashbox (CB) chart peak positions.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Studio albums ===\u000a1967 \u2013 Moby Grape\u000a1968 \u2013 Wow/Grape Jam\u000a1969 \u2013 Moby Grape '69\u000a1969 \u2013 Truly Fine Citizen\u000a1971 \u2013 20 Granite Creek\u000a1984 \u2013 Moby Grape '84 (also known as "Silver Wheels" or "The Heart Album")\u000a1989 \u2013 Legendary Grape\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Live albums ===\u000a1978 \u2013 Live Grape\u000a2010 \u2013 Moby Grape Live\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Compilations ===\u000a1971 \u2013 Omaha (features '69 album without tracks 'Ooh Mama Ooh' and 'Seeing'; plus 'Omaha' from 1st album)\u000a1973 \u2013 Great Grape\u000a1986 \u2013 Murder in My Heart \u2013 compilation album of selections from Wow, Moby Grape '69 and Truly Fine Citizen.\u000a1993 \u2013 Vintage: The Very Best of Moby Grape\u000a2004 \u2013 Crosstalk: The Best of Moby Grape\u000a2007 \u2013 Listen My Friends!

aVThe West Siberian petroleum basin (variously known as the West Siberian hydrocarbon province, Western Siberian oil basin, etc.) is the largest hydrocarbon (petroleum and natural gas) basin in the world covering an area of about 2.2 million km2.\u000aGeographically it corresponds to the West Siberian plain. From continental West Siberia, it extends into the Kara Sea as the East-Prinovozemelsky field.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description ==\u000aThe public domain U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 2201-G describes the basin as follows.\u000a\u000aThe basin occupies a swampy plain between the Ural Mountains and the Yenisey River. On the north, the basin extends offshore into the southern Kara Sea. On the west, north, and east, the basin is surrounded by the Ural, Yenisey Ridge, and Turukhan- Igarka foldbelts that experienced major deformations during the Hercynian tectonic event and the Novaya Zemlya foldbelt that was deformed in early Cimmerian (Triassic) time. On the south, the folded Caledonian structures of the Central Kazakhstan and Altay-Sayan regions dip northward beneath the basin\u2019s sedimentary cover. The basin is a relatively undeformed Mesozoic sag that overlies the Hercynian accreted terrane and the Early Triassic rift system. The basement is composed of foldbelts that were deformed in Late Carboniferous\u2013Permian time during collision of the Siberian and Kazakhstan continents with the Russian craton. The basement also includes several microcontinental blocks with a relatively undeformed Paleozoic sedimentary sequence.\u000aThe sedimentary succession of the basin is composed of Middle Triassic through Tertiary clastic rocks. The lower part of this succession is present only in the northern part of the basin; southward, progressively younger strata onlap the basement, so that in the southern areas the basement is overlain by Toarcian and younger rocks. The important stage in tectono-stratigraphic development of the basin was formation of a deep-water sea in Volgian\u2013early Berriasian time. The sea covered more than one million km 2 in the central basin area. Highly organic-rich siliceous shales of the Bazhenov Formation were deposited during this time in anoxic conditions on the sea bottom. Rocks of this formation have generated more than 80 percent of West Siberian oil reserves and probably a substantial part of its gas reserves. The deep-water basin was filled by prograding clastic clinoforms during Neocomian time. The clastic material was transported by a system of rivers dominantly from the eastern provenance. Sandstones within the Neocomian clinoforms contain the principal oil reservoirs. The thick continental Aptian\u2013 Cenomanian Pokur Formation above the Neocomian sequence contains giant gas reserves in the northern part of the basin.\u000aThree total petroleum systems are identified in the West Siberian basin. Volumes of discovered hydrocarbons in these systems are 144 billion barrels of oil and more than 1,300 trillion cubic feet of gas. The assessed mean undiscovered resources are 55.2 billion barrels of oil, 642.9 trillion cubic feet of gas, and 20.5 billion barrels of natural gas liquids.\u000aThe largest known oil reserves are in the Bazhenov-Neocomian Total Petroleum System that includes Upper Jurassic and younger rocks of the central and southern parts of the basin. Oil reservoirs are mainly in Neocomian and Upper Jurassic clastic strata. Source rocks are organic-rich siliceous shales of the Bazhenov Formation. Most discovered reserves are in structural traps, but stratigraphic traps in the Neocomian clinoform sequence are productive and are expected to contain much of the undiscovered resources. Two assessment units are identified in this total petroleum system. The first assessment unit includes all conventional reservoirs in the stratigraphic interval from the Upper Jurassic to the Cenomanian. The second unit includes unconventional (or continuous), self-sourced, fractured reservoirs in the Bazhenov Formation. This unit was not assessed quantitatively.\u000aThe Togur-Tyumen Total Petroleum System covers the same geographic area as the Bazhenov-Neocomian system, but it includes older, Lower\u2013Middle Jurassic strata and weathered rocks at the top of the pre-Jurassic sequence. A Callovian regional shale seal of the Abalak and lower Vasyugan Formations separates the two systems. The Togur-Tyumen system is oil-prone; gas reserves are insignificant. The principal oil reserves are in sandstone reservoirs at the top and bottom of the Lower\u2013Middle Jurassic Tyumen Formation; comparatively small reserves are in pre-Jurassic carbonate and clastic rocks. The principal source rocks are lacustrine to marine shales of the Toarcian Togur Bed. Traps are structural, stratigraphic, or a combination of the two. The total petroleum system was asssessed as a single assessment unit. Most of the undiscovered resources are expected in stratigraphic and combination traps.\u000aThe northern onshore and offshore parts of the basin are included in the Northern West Siberian Mesozoic Composite Total Petroleum System that encompasses the entire sedimentary cover. The system is strongly gas-prone; it contains giant gas reserves and comparatively small oil reserves. The major part of hydrocarbon reserves is dry gas in the upper Aptian\u2013Cenomanian sandstones (Pokur Formation and equivalents). Smaller reserves of wet gas and some oil are in Jurassic and Neocomian sandstones. Source rocks for the dry gas in the Pokur Formation that constitutes more than 80 percent of the hydrocarbon reserves are unknown. Wet Neocomian gas and oil were generated from Jurassic source rocks, including the Bazhenov Formation.\u000aAlmost all discovered reserves are in structural traps; however, stratigraphic traps in the Neocomian interval probably contain large undiscovered gas resources. The onshore and offshore parts of the total petroleum system were assessed as separate units because of different exploration maturity and different infrastructure requirements. The onshore area is substantially explored, especially in the shallow Aptian\u2013Cenomanian sequence, whereas only three exploratory wells have been drilled offshore. Undiscovered gas potential of both assessment units is very high.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Great Plains skink (Plestiodon obsoletus) is a species of lizard endemic to North America.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description ==\u000aThe Great Plains skink, together with the broad-headed skink, is the largest skink of the genus Plestiodon. It reaches a length of 9 to 13 cm from snout to vent (SVL) or up to nearly 34 cm total length (including the tail).\u000aThis lizard is light gray or beige in color; its dorsal scales have black or dark brown edges. The scales on the sides run diagonally. The belly is yellow. Juveniles are black with white sports on the lips and the head and have a blue or bluish tail.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geographic range ==\u000aThe Great Plains skink is very common on the Great Plains, ranging from southeastern Wyoming and Nebraska (and also Fremont County, Iowa) southward to eastern Arizona, Texas, and into Mexico.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Habitat ==\u000aThis skink lives in open plains habitat or the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains, in areas near water, e.g. irrigation ditches. In southeastern Colorado, it occurs in elevation up to about 1900 m (7200 ft); in northern Colorado, only at elevations below about 1400 m (4500 ft).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reproduction ==\u000aThe mating season of the Great Plains skink is in April or May. The female lays between 5 and 32 eggs (on the average about 12) in early summer, which she guards until they hatch in late summer.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aBaird, S.F., and C.F.

aVThe Rove Formation is located in the upper northeastern part of Cook County, Minnesota, United States, and extends into Ontario, Canada. It is the youngest of the many Animikie layers, a layer of sedimentary rocks.\u000aBefore the Rove sediments were laid down, during the Archean Eon, the Algoman orogeny added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region; this boundary is the Great Lakes tectonic zone. Several million years later a thin layer of hypervelocity impact ejecta from the Sudbury impact event was deposited on the older, underlying, Gunflint Iron Formation, and the Rove was then deposited on top of the ejecta; it is estimated that at ground zero the earthquake generated by the meteor impact would have registered 10.2 on the Richter scale.\u000aDuring the Middle Precambrian a shallow inland sea covered much of the Lake Superior region and formed the Animikie Group, layers of sedimentary rocks overlying 2700-million-year-old Archean rocks. The Rove Formation is the youngest of the many Animikie layers.\u000aAfter the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny added more land mass by accretion that occurred from the south. A few hundred million years later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone, which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The more resistant diabase sills and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.\u000aAs a result of erosion of sandstone and the erosion-resistant sills and dikes, the topography in Minnesota has repeated parallel hills and valleys. The tightly packed lakes in the narrow valleys are long and narrow, and they orient from the east to west. The cliffs in these narrow valleys are the habitat to several rare plants which prefer living in narrow cliff areas in a sub-Arctic climate. In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlain by a thick diabase cap.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Location ==\u000a\u000aThe Rove Formation is in the Arrowhead Region of northeastern Minnesota, U.S., and extends into Ontario, Canada. In Minnesota it occurs along the U.S.-Ontario border from Gunflint Lake to Pigeon Point (both in northeastern Cook County) and northward into Canada. Pigeon Point is the most eastern part of Minnesota; it is a diabase sill about 152 m (500 ft) thick. Both the north and south coasts of the point expose Rove slates under and over the sill. Within the sill, rates of cooling and gravity have created an interesting distribution of rock types.\u000aThe visible formation is in Minnesota and contains many east-west oriented ridges and valleys. Many lakes in this 5 to 8 km (3 to 5 mi) wide band along the Canada\u2013US border are in the elongated east-west valleys; included are Caribou, Clearwater, Crocodile, Daniels, Duncan, Dunn, Hungry Jack, Iron, Loon, Moose, Pine, Portage and South. In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlaid by a thick diabase sill.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geologic history ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Archean Eon ===\u000a\u000aThe Archean Eon lasted from 3,800 million years ago until approximately 2,500 million years ago.\u000a\u000aThe Algoman orogeny occurred 2800 to 2,500 million years ago, and it marks the end of the crust-building Archean Eon. There were several episodes of continental collision, compression and subduction which resulted in mountain building during this time. Orogenic events are characterized by extensive metaphorism, granitic extrusions and unconformities. The Algoman orogeny added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region; this boundary is the Great Lakes tectonic zone (GLTZ).\u000aNortheast Minnesota has 2700-million-year-ago exposed rocks formed during volcanic activity that was in the form of seepage of lava from rifts in the sea floor. These lava flows began to rise up out of the ancient ocean to form the Superior craton; the Superior craton later assembled into the Canadian shield, which became part of the North American craton. The Superior province is the largest preserved fragment of Archean crust, and the Canadian shield is the nucleus of the North American craton.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Proterozoic Eon ===\u000aThe Proterozoic Eon lasted from 2,500 million years ago until 570 million years ago\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Animikie Group ====\u000aThe Animikie Basin, measuring 700 x 400 km (420 mi x 240 mi), is an elongated oval straddling the North Shore of Lake Superior, mainly in Minnesota. Approximately the northwestern two-thirds lies to the northwest of the shoreline; the southeastern third lies to the southeast of the shoreline (so is under Lake Superior's waters).\u000aDuring the Middle Precambrian a shallow inland sea covered much of the Lake Superior region and formed the Animikie Group, which are layers of sedimentary rocks which unconformably overlies 2700-million-year-old Archean rocks. This group contains both the Rove and Gunflint Iron formations. The Rove Formation is the youngest of the many Animikie layers; it consists of gently tilted fine-grained sediments. It is composed of greywackes and black shale, and contains lower concentrations of iron and taconite than the underlying Gunflint Iron Formation does.\u000aThe Rove Formation consists of a lower argillite unit, a middle transition unit and an upper thin-bedded greywacke unit. The lower argillite unit is about 150 m (490 ft) thick; this layer contains fine-grained greywacke, and silty and graphitic argillites. Greywacke is a sedimentary rock composed of a mixture of poorly sorted grains of sand, silt and clay particles. Argillite is a fine-grained sedimentary rock composed primarily of clay particles; they are essentially lithified muds and oozes. Greywacke is abundant in the middle unit and dominates the upper unit. The complete thickness of the upper two units is about 900 m (3,000 ft).\u000aGunter Faure and Jack Kovach, using Rb-Sr dating, determined the age to be 1635 ±24 million years old. The Resident Geologist Program, Geology of the Thunder Bay South District, reports an age of 1800 million years old.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Penokean orogeny ====\u000a\u000aThe Penokean Mountain Range formed in the Penokean orogeny 1880 to 1830 million years ago, when an oceanic island arc called the Pembine\u2013Wausau terrane collided with the southern margin of the Superior craton. From 1880 to 1850 million years ago, the region was volcanically active. This volcanism ceased 1850 million years ago when a fragment of Archean crust arrived from the South at the subduction zone. Collision of this Archean crust in the south with the Superior craton in the North caused a period of intense crustal shortening. Rocks of the Pembine\u2013Wassau terrane were thrust up over and onto the Superior craton, forming a mountain range that covered all but the northernmost portion of Lake Superior, crossed parts of three US states (south-central Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan), and continued to the southernmost tip of Ontario, Canada. Loading of the lithosphere by these thrust sheets caused it to flex downwards, forming a foreland basin at around 1850 million years ago in the south and 1835 million years ago in the north. The Rove Formation was deposited in the northern basin. In the southern basin, crustal thickening caused high-grade metamorphism of the sedimentary fill by 1830 million years ago. A series of post-orogenic plutons intruded into the overlying rocks 1830 million years ago,; these plutons mark the end of the Penokean orogeny.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Sudbury impact ejecta ====\u000aAt the base of the Rove Formation, between the Rove and the underlying Gunflint Iron Formation, there is a lateral layer of shocked quartz and feldspar grains found within accretionary lapilli, accreted grain clusters and spherule masses. These pieces of debris indicate that the layer contains hypervelocity impact ejecta. Zircon geochronologic data shows that this layer formed 1878 to 1836 million years ago; the Sudbury Impact event occurred 1,850 ± 1 million years ago. Because of the closeness in dating and the nearness of the crater, the Sudbury Impact event is the likely source for the ejecta; these are the oldest ejecta linked to a specific event on Earth. In the Rove area this layer is about 7.6 m (25 ft) thick; this thin layer very likely represents the catastrophic events of a single day nearly 1,850 million years ago.\u000aEvidence indicates a 16 km (10 mi) diameter meteorite collided with Earth in the current-day vicinity of Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, about 1,850 million years ago. The meteorite vaporized and created a 240 km (150 mi) wide crater (this is the second-largest impact depression on Earth). This impact is 770 km (480 mi) east of the Minnesota-Ontario border of the Rove Formation. Earthquakes shattered the ground hundreds of miles away and within seconds ejecta (cloud of ash, rock fragments, gases and droplets of molten rock) began to spread around the globe. It is estimated that at ground zero the earthquake would have registered 10.2 on the Richter scale. Seas covered the Rove Formation area and the Sudbury impact generated huge tsunamis.\u000aTo put the Sudbury meteorite impact in perspective, the Chicxulub impact on the Yucatán Peninsula occurred 66 million years ago from an object perhaps 60% the size of the Sudbury impactor; the results of this impact caused the worldwide extinction of many species (including dinosaurs).\u000aThe Sudbury Impact would have had global ramifications; it is conjectured that this caused the end of the iron deposits. The impact fundamentally affected concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the sea; the accumulation of marine sediments (known as banded-iron formations) were almost instantaneously shut down. Banded-iron formations are massive deposits rich in iron oxides; they accumulated at several periods in the Earth's geologic past. One extended episode of banded-iron formation buildup suddenly ended about 1,850 million years ago. In northeastern Minnesota these banded-iron formations lie immediately under the ejecta layer. Minnesota's Iron Range is composed of this layer of banded-iron formation.\u000aMost of the impact layer in the Rove area consists of beccia, a mixture of rock fragments which ripped loose from the sea floor during the earthquakes. The tsunamis jumbled the loosened bedrock and ejecta together; over time this layer was buried by younger sediments, cemented together and fused by molten rock to form a solid layer. Ejecta from the Sudbury Impact was found in May 2007 on the Gunflint Trail in Cook County, Minnesota. Geologists Mark Jirsa and Paul Weiblen from the University of Minnesota took advantage of the burnt-over landscape resulting from the intense, hot Ham Lake fire to explore the newly exposed geology along the Gunflint Trail. Jirsa picked up some rocks which turned out to be ash and debris from the 1,100 km (680 mi) distant impact site; this is the farthest distance that Sudbury detrita has been found.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Midcontinent Rift ====\u000a\u000aThe Midcontinent Rift (also known as the Keewenawan Rift) began about 1,100 million years ago; it lasted for about 20 million years. After the Penokean Mountains had eroded away, the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along this rift zone. The 2,000 km (1,200 mi) bow-shaped rift extended from northeastern Kansas, through the southeastern corner of Nebraska, diagonally northeast through Iowa, through Minnesota along the current Minnesota-Wisconsin border, arced through the present-day Lake Superior basin and angled southeasterly through Michigan.\u000aThe Midcontinent Rift is the largest-known continental rift in the world. The rift began as a hot spot of basaltic magma underneath the Lake Superior region; it extruded layers of lava up to 20 km (12 mi) thick and extending up to 100 km (60 mi) on either side of the rift. The deposited lava along the North Shore of Lake Superior is 7,620 m (5 mi) thick.\u000aThis was a fast-spreading rift; the resulting basalts show little interaction with the then-existing rock. These immense volumes of mafic lava were generated in two major pulses, mostly via a hot mantle plume. Along the North Shore of Lake Superior, one can see the solidified lava (igneous rock) most everywhere. In the Rove region the magma didn't reach the surface; it intruded into fractures in the formation and slowly cooled to become diabase (rather than basalt). These solidified bodies are the Pigeon River and Logan Intrusion diabases.\u000aThe continent didn't split into two because the Grenville province (a microcontinent) was converging with the proto-North American continent to the east. This convergence applied compressional forces to the rift, preventing the complete splitting apart of the proto-North American continent.\u000aThis rift was the last of volcanic or mountain-building activity in present-day Minnesota. The solidified lava flows have sagged, tilted and faulted; this created a basin up to 5,000 m (16,000 ft) deep along the rift zone. Proto-Lake Superior filled the basin.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Puckwunge Formation ====\u000a\u000aThe Puckwunge Formation has buff to grey sandstone which comes from sediments deposited during the early stages of the Midcontinent rift; zircon dating shows a time period of 1200 to 1100 million years ago.\u000aPuckwunge sandstone is exposed along an extremely narrow (feet-wide) band on the southwestern border of the Rove formation. The Puckwunge exposure begins at Raspberry Point within the Grand Portage National Monument on Lake Superior, Cook County, Minnesota, and extends for about 40 km (25 mi) inland to the northwest. The Rove Formation is located to the northeast of the Puckwunge sandstone; none is southwest of the border. The Rove Formation is bisected by several bands of Pigeon River Diabase; these bands are in a west-to-east orientation. The bands of Pigeon River Diabase do extend southwesterly past the Puckwunge Formation.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Quaternary Period and glaciation ===\u000aThe Quaternary Period began about 2 million years ago and continues today. This is the period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The Rove region has multiple tilted layers of volcanic rocks and easily eroded shale. The more resistant diabase dikes and sills remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. These former shale valleys filled with water, forming the many lakes in the region. The character of the slates made them especially well suited for glacial quarrying, much more so than the contiguous sills. A cuesta \u2013 a ridge formed by gently tilted sedimentary rock layers \u2013 topography had developed and was dominated by major east-west valleys with a few pronounced gaps in the intervening ridges.\u000aThe Rainy Lobe of the Wisconsin glaciation was the most recent of the glaciation events, and it retreated about 10,000 years ago. Glacial scratches and grooves in Rove rocks indicate a north or somewhat east-of-north glacial movement. This direction is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges. The lakes in the Rove Formation area are unique from other well-known linear bedrock lakes in North America because their long axes lie transverse to the general movement of the glaciers.\u000aWhen continental glaciers moved over the Rove Formation area, the ice was a hundreds of meters thick and its surface sloped gently southward from the Patrician center to the north. The base of the ice sheet encountered the cuesta topography relief of a few hundred feet. Because the ice over the valleys would be thicker than the ice over the ridges, obstructed extrusion flow would operate and resulted in the removal of the easily quarried slates of the valleys. The ridges would not be appreciably eroded, partly because the ice would be thinner over the ridges and therefore less plastic, and partly because of the resistance of the diabase to both quarrying and abrasion by the ice.\u000aThe weight of the ice sheet compressed the land and created depressions. As the glacier retreated, the weight and pressure were relieved from the surface of the land and the land rebounded; the rebound process continues, and is estimated to be 100 m (330 ft).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Human history ==\u000a\u000aThe Pigeon River forms the border between Minnesota and Ontario in this area. The first 32 km (20 mi) of the river is crooked, swift, interrupted by rapids and falls, and flows in places through a steep-walled canyon. The High Falls are 37 m (120 ft) high and presents an impassable obstacle to river travel. The Cascade Falls are further up the river. The soft shale erodes easily, leaving the Logan and Pigeon River diabases which create the waterfalls and cascades.\u000aA portage was necessary from the shore of Lake Superior past the High Falls. Southwest of the mouth of the Pigeon River is Grand Portage Bay; about 1.6 km (1.0 mi) inland there is a gap through the surrounding hills and bluffs which provides a gradual ascent to Cascade Falls. The river is navigable by canoe beyond the Cascade Falls. The Sioux and Chippewa created a 14.5 km (9.0 mi) long portage from Grand Portage Bay to bypass the three falls and several kilometers of turbulent river up to the Cascade Falls, probably by following animal trails. The French called this trail the Great Portage because it was so long.\u000aThe first-known non-native visitors were French-speaking people from France and eastern Canada who started to explore the area in about 1655. They were looking for the Northwest Passage and to trade for furs, particularly beaver pelts. Beaver pelts were in demand for European fashion during the 17th and 18th centuries. The Grand Portage was on the major fur trade route of the 18th century and was the first of more than 40 portages along the fur trade route. The French-Canadian voyageurs would carry two 40 kg (88 lb) packs from the main storage depot at Grand Portage Bay along the trail to their smaller storage depot at Fort Charlotte; it took a few hours. In 1784 Grand Portage Bay became the headquarters for the North West Company. The post was abandoned in 1803 when the North West Company moved north.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Present-day topography ==\u000aIn Ontario, the shales and greywackes from the Rove Formation of the Animikie Group are overlain by a 60 m (200 ft) cap of diabase. This diabase cap is a sill remnant, and most of the diabase is covered by a considerable thickness of mineral soil. The mesa at Russell Point (about 16 km (10 mi) south of Thunder Bay) is a Logan sill of diabase over the softer Rove Formation metasediments. It is one of the many flat-topped, steep-sided mesas along Lake Superior's northwestern shore south of Thunder Bay that are collectively known as the Nor'Wester Mountains.\u000aIn Minnesota, the Rove Formation area shows a relationship of bedrock to topography, with its valley-and-ridge landscape. There are several series of steep, east-west oriented valleys which were created by the erosion of the exposed shale. The diabase-capped ridges between the valleys slope gently to the south (4° to 15° from the horizontal); the northern faces are precipitous; they rise 60 to 140 m (200 to 460 ft) above deep, cold lakes, creating an asymmetrical cross-section profile. The asymmetrical cross section of the ridges is the result of bands of massive, poorly jointed rock alternating with highly jointed rock units. The valleys contain glacially quarried bedrock lakes; they are also asymmetrical in cross section because of the same structural elements which control the ridge shapes. Most of the lakes show an asymmetrical bottom configuration, showing a steep subaqueous slope on the south shore. The northern-facing cliffs provide the habitat for a few species of endangered flora. The Rove Formation has landscape features that are not found elsewhere in Minnesota.\u000aMost of the valleys are occupied by chains of elongate lakes, many of which are bordered by solid rock on all sides. Many of the east-west valleys terminate abruptly at either one or both ends when the bordering sills merge. The elevation of the lakes ranges from Rose Lake's 465 m (1,526 ft) to Loon Lake's 532 m (1,745 ft) above sea level. Lakes on the opposite sides of a single ridge may differ in surface elevation by as much as 60 m (200 ft). Many of the rock-bound lakes have a depth of about 30 m (100 ft); a few are deeper than 61 m (200 ft).\u000aA topographic map shows that the majority of the interconnected complex of tightly packed lakes with their valley-and-ridge landscape is primarily in Minnesota; the border of the landscape is the Canada\u2013US border. This border is composed of the Pigeon River, and these Rove Formation lakes (going east to west): South Fowl, North Fowl, Moose, Mountain, Watap, Rose, South, Little North and Gunflint. The border runs approximately through the center of the lengths of these lakes. The only Rove-typical east-west oriented lakes lying in Ontario are Arrow and North lakes.\u000aThe preglacial drainage pattern was controlled by the rock structure. Ver Steeg reconstructed a preglacial drainage pattern that shows major streams flowing east in the slate belts. Short tributaries and short north-south segments of the major streams cut across ridges which formed small gaps that are still present.\u000aThe Laurentian Continental Divide is within the formation. Between North Lake, Ontario, and South Lake, Minnesota, is a low saddle of land right on the border; this is the divide. North Lake drains into the Rainy River and then to Hudson Bay. South Lake drains into the Pigeon River and then to Lake Superior.\u000aTopsoils are thin and poor because the glaciers had abraded down to the bedrock. The soils are clayey silt.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Endangered flora ==\u000aTopographically this is the Rove Slate Bedrock Complex Landtype Association. The sedimentary and diabase rocks are calcareous; they produce a more basic, nutrient-rich soil compared to the poorer soils typical of the Canadian shield. The Royal River drains Royal Lake [which is about 1.2 km (3,900 ft) east of South Fowl Lake] into John Lake, both in Minnesota. The relatively rich soils, particularly in the Royal River drainage area, along with steep, moist, north-facing cliffs provide the habitat for these rare plants. For over a century this landtype association has been recognized as being ecologically and botanically unique; it harbors a rare assemblage of plants, including the rarest plants in Minnesota. Virtually all of the known sensitive plant species in this landscape association occur on the north side of the cliffs or in the Royal River drainage.\u000aSix vascular plants are unique in that they are at the extreme edge of their range or are disjunct from the main range of their species. They are the Maidenhair spleenwort (Asplenium trichomanes L.), in Minnesota six small populations of 20 to 40 plants have been found in the Rove area; Ross's (or Short) sedge (Carex rossii), only three populations are known to exist in the Rove area; Large-leaved sandwort (Moehringia macrophylla or Arenaria macrophylla), evidence indicates that this is a very rare species with limited distribution and restrictive environmental needs; Sticky locoweed (Oxytropis borealis var. viscida), is restricted to a single cliff in Cook County; Encrusted saxifrage (Saxifraga paniculata ssp. neogaea), 11 populations are known to exist in the Rove formation; and Smooth Woodsia (Woodsia glabella), there are small, isolated populations in the Rove Formation.\u000aDuring two sensitive plant surveys conducted in June and July 2003, and July 2004, a Superior National Forest sensitive plant, Canada Yew (Taxus canadensis), was found; and a state-listed species of concern, Blunt-fruited sweet cicely (Osmorhiza depauperata), has only four populations within 30 km (19 mi) of each other. Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources lists these vascular plants as being threatened: Rocky Mountain woodsia (Woodsia scopulina ssp. laurentiana), there are few isolated populations in the formation; and Holboell's rock-cress (Boechera retrofracta or Arabis holboellii var. retrofracta), rare in Ontario and Minnesota. Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources lists the Nodding saxifrage (Saxifraga cernua) as endangered, one source refers it to being "very rare" and that Cook County has Minnesota's single colony with about a dozen plants \u2013 the entire population occupies less than a 1 m2 (1 sq yd) \u2013 so it is vulnerable to singular events which would alter its habitat.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Ayres Thrush, formerly the Snow S-2, Aero Commander Ag Commander, and Rockwell Thrush Commander, is an American agricultural aircraft produced by Ayres Corporation and more recently by Thrush Aircraft. It is one of the most successful and long-lived agricultural application aircraft types in the world, with almost 2,000 sold since the first example flew 62 years ago. Typical of agricultural aircraft, it is a single-seat monoplane of conventional taildragger configuration. Originally powered by a radial piston engine, most examples produced since the 1980s have been turboprop-powered.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Design and development ==\u000a\u000aThe Thrush was designed by Leland Snow, first flew in 1956 and before long was being produced in series as the S-2 by the company he founded, Snow Aeronautical. In 1965, the corporation and all of its assets were purchased by the Aero Commander division of Rockwell, which put it into production alongside the CallAir A-9 that it had also acquired, branding both unrelated (though similar) machines as "Ag Commanders". When Rockwell dropped the Aero Commander brand, the S-2 was renamed the "Thrush Commander".\u000aIn 1977, Rockwell sold off the production rights to the aircraft and the production facility at Albany, Georgia, which were purchased by Ayres Corporation, a firm which had been built on retro-fitting turboprop engines to Thrush Commanders. On June 30, 2003, Ayres' assets were purchased by Thrush Aircraft, the current producer of the aircraft.\u000aThe S-2 and its several variants have been purchased by agricultural spraying operators in many countries. Large numbers are operated in the United States and Australia, while other countries using the type include Costa Rica, France, Guyana, Iran, Israel, Jamaica, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\u000aAyres developed a special anti-narcotics crop-spraying version of the Turbo-Thrush for the United States Department of State. This version, known as the Narcotics Eradication Delivery System (NEDS) featured an armored cockpit and engine to protect against hostile ground fire. Nine were sold to the Department of State between 1983 and 1985. Ayres also attempted to market a militarized version as the Ayres Vigilante, intended for the Close Air Support role, but this failed to attract customers. IOMAX USA of North Carolina, which had previously modified Air Tractor AT-802 agricultural aircraft as reconnaissance/attack aircraft, has developed the Archangel attack aircraft modeled on the S-2R-660. The United Arab Emirates has ordered 24 Archangels, with delivery from June 2015.\u000aTwo Thrush 510Gs were modified to perform a counter-insurgency role by the Austrian company Airborne Technologies at the direction of Erik Prince, the former head of Blackwater, but in the absence of an export license the aircraft have not been used operationally.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Variants ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Snow Aeronautical ===\u000a(per Simpson, 2005, p. 39)\u000aS-1\u000ainitial prototype with open cockpit.\u000aS-2\u000apre-production version of S-1 - three built.\u000aS-2A\u000ainitial production version, powered by Continental engine \u2013 73 built.\u000aS-2B\u000aS-2 powered by 450 hp Pratt & Whitney R-985 \u2013 19 built.\u000aS-2C\u000arefined production version \u2013 214 built.\u000aS-2C-600\u000aS-2C re-engined with Pratt & Whitney R-1340-AN1.\u000aS-2D\u000a6,000 lb take-off weight \u2013 105 built.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Aero Commander ===\u000aS-2D Ag Commander\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Rockwell ===\u000aThrush Commander 600\u000aThrush Commander 800\u000apowered by Wright R-1300.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Marsh ===\u000aS2R-T Turbo Thrush\u000aRockwell Thrush Commanders converted to turbine power by Marsh Aviation using Garrett AiResearch TPE331-1-101 engines.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ayres ===\u000aS-2R 1340\u000aequivalent to Thrush Commander 600.\u000aS-2R 1820\u000aBull Thrush\u000aPezetel Thrush\u000apowered by PZL-3.\u000aS-2R-T\u000aturboprop powered versions equipped with Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Thrush Aircraft ===\u000aThrush Model 400\u000aThrush Model 510G\u000aGeneral Electric H80 powered\u000aThrush Model 510GR\u000aHoneywell TPE 331 powered\u000aThrush Model 510P\u000aPratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-34 powered\u000aThrush Model 550\u000aPratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-65AG powered\u000aThrush Model 710\u000aPratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-65AG powered\u000aArchangel\u000aThrush 550G modified as two-seat armed attack aircraft. 1,600 shp (1,200 kW) PT6A-67F engine.

aVBertrand Russell "Bert" Berns (November 8, 1929 \u2013 December 30, 1967), also known as Bert Russell and (occasionally) Russell Byrd, was an American songwriter and record producer of the 1960s. A pioneer of 1960s rock and soul, Berns made numerous contributions to popular music, including "Twist and Shout", "Piece of My Heart", "Brown Eyed Girl" (as a producer), "Here Comes the Night", "Hang On Sloopy", "Under the Boardwalk" and "Everybody Needs Somebody to Love".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aBorn in the Bronx, New York City, to Russian Jewish immigrants, Berns contracted rheumatic fever as a child, an illness that damaged his heart and would mark the rest of his life, resulting in his early death. Turning to music, he found consonance in the sounds of his African American and Latino neighbors. As a young man, Berns danced in mambo nightclubs, and made his way to Havana before the Cuban Revolution.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Music career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Beginnings (1960\u20131963) ===\u000aShortly after his return from Cuba, Berns began a seven-year run from an obscure Brill Building songwriter to owner of his own record labels. He signed as a $50/week songwriter with Robert Mellin Music at 1650 Broadway in 1960. His first hit record was "A Little Bit of Soap", performed by the Jarmels on Laurie Records in 1961. Berns himself had a short-lived career as a recording artist, and in 1961, under the name "Russell Byrd", Berns scored his only Billboard Hot 100 appearance with his own composition, "You'd Better Come Home", which peaked at Number 50. That song would later be recorded by the Isley Brothers, and featured as the B-side of their 1962 single "Twistin' With Linda". Also in 1962, the Isley Brothers recorded "Twist and Shout" on Wand Records, written by Berns and Phil Medley. Berns also hit the charts in late 1962 with the Exciters' "Tell Him" on United Artists, and with Solomon Burke's "Cry to Me" on Atlantic Records. As an independent producer working with myriad record labels, Berns also made important records with Garnet Mimms ("Cry Baby") and Gene Pitney ("If I Didn't Have a Dime (To Play the Jukebox)").\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Atlantic Records (1963\u20131965) ===\u000aBerns's early work with Solomon Burke brought him to the attention of Atlantic label chiefs Ahmet Ertegün and Jerry Wexler. In 1963, Berns replaced Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller as the staff producer at Atlantic, where he wrote and produced hits for Solomon Burke ("Everybody Needs Somebody to Love"), the Drifters ("Under the Boardwalk" and "Saturday Night at the Movies"), Barbara Lewis ("Baby I'm Yours" and "Make Me Your Baby"), Little Esther Phillips ("Hello Walls"), Ben E. King, Wilson Pickett and LaVern Baker.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== British Invasion (1964\u20131965) ===\u000aWith many of Berns's songs being recorded by British Invasion bands such as the Beatles ("Twist and Shout"), the Rolling Stones ("Cry to Me") and the Animals ("Baby Let Me Take You Home"), Berns became the first American record producer to travel across the Atlantic to work in London. He went to England three times between 1964 and 1965, where he produced a number of British Decca artists such as Van Morrison's Them ("Here Comes the Night", "Baby Please Don't Go") and Lulu.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== BANG Records (1965\u20131967) ===\u000aIn 1965, Berns formed his own record label, BANG Records. BANG Records was founded with his Atlantic Records partners, with the label's name derived from the initials of each of their respective personal names\u2014in order, Bert Berns, Ahmet Ertegün, Nesuhi Ertegün, and Gerald (Jerry) Wexler. BANG was home to such artists as the McCoys ("Hang on Sloopy"), the Strangeloves ("I Want Candy"), Them's ex-lead singer Van Morrison ("Brown Eyed Girl"), and, most notably, Neil Diamond ("Solitary Man" and "Cherry Cherry").\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Shout Records (1966\u20131967) ===\u000aWith BANG Records releasing predominantly rock and roll, Berns formed Shout Records in 1966 as an outlet for his greatest passions of R&B and soul music, recording artists such Freddie Scott ("Are You Lonely for Me Baby") and Erma Franklin ("Piece of My Heart"). One of his last songs, "Piece of My Heart," was covered shortly thereafter by Big Brother and the Holding Company, which the then unknown Janis Joplin fronted.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Death and legacy ==\u000aBerns, who had a history of cardiac trouble, as a result of his heart being damaged from rheumatic fever contracted during childhood, died in his New York apartment of heart failure on December 30, 1967, aged 38. He was buried two days later, following a funeral service at Riverside Memorial Chapel on New York's 180 West 76th Street in Manhattan.\u000aThough not as widely known as his contemporaries, Bert Berns ranks among the most significant and influential of his generation, on a par with the writer-producer teams of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller and Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland. Beyond his contribution to artists such as The Isley Brothers, The Exciters, Solomon Burke, The Drifters, Ben E. King, Van Morrison, and Neil Diamond, Berns has been credited with bringing Latin rhythms to soul music and soul to rock and roll.\u000aThe Led Zeppelin outtake "Baby Come On Home" (originally titled "A Tribute To Bert Berns") was loosely based on a song Berns wrote for Hoagy Lands, and was recorded in Berns' honour.\u000aA book on his life and career, Here Comes the Night: The Dark Soul of Bert Berns and the Dirty Business of Rhythm and Blues by Joel Selvin, was published in 2014.\u000aA musical, Piece of My Heart: The Bert Berns Story by Daniel Goldfarb, premiered off Broadway in 2014 at the Pershing Square Signature Center.\u000aA documentary film titled BANG!

It is operated by Metro Istanbul (known as Istanbul Ula\u015f\u0131m A.\u015e. before 2016), a public enterprise, controlled by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. The oldest section is the metro is M1 line, which opened in 1989; it now includes 82 stations in service, with 62 more under construction.\u000aThe system consists of six lines named M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 and the M6 Mini-Metro. More lines are under construction or planned: M8 (Bostanc\u0131-Dudullu) will be on the Asian side, while M7 (Kabata\u015f-Mahmutbey), M9 (Ataköy-\u0130kitelli) will be on the European side.\u000aIstanbul Metro is connected with Marmaray and F1 Funicular underground systems and T1 modern tram ground system.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aThe oldest underground urban rail line in Istanbul is the Tünel, which entered service on January 17, 1875. It is the world's second-oldest underground urban rail line after the London Underground which was built in 1863, and the first underground urban rail line in continental Europe.\u000aThe first master plan for a full metro network in Istanbul, titled Avant Projet d'un Métropolitain à Constantinople and conceived by the French engineer L. Guerby, dates to January 10, 1912. The plan comprised a total of 24 stations between the Topkap\u0131 and \u015ei\u015fli districts and included a connection through the Golden Horn. Each station would have a 75-metre platform next to the rail line, while the distance between stations varied from 220 to 975 metres. The blueprints of the project, which was never realized, are today displayed at the Istanbul Technical University Museum.\u000aIn 1936 the French urban planner Henri Prost proposed a metro network between the districts of Taksim and Beyaz\u0131t, to the north and south of the Golden Horn, respectively. In October 1951 the Dutch firm Nedeco proposed a similar route between Taksim and Beyaz\u0131t, and in September 1952 the Director of the Paris Transportation Department, Marc Langevin, prepared a 14-chapter report together with his associate Louis Meizzonet for the implementation of the project and its integration with the other means of public transportation in the city. However, these plans never came into effect and all proposals were put on hold until 1987, when the planning for the current Istanbul Metro was made.\u000aConstruction works for the first 'modern' mass transit railway system started in 1989. The M1 was initially called "Hafif Metro" (which literally translates as "light metro"). Although it was built as a fully grade separated line, the M1 line operates with shorter trainsets and shorter station platforms than is standard on a traditional metro line, hence its "light metro" designation. The M1 line was later extended from Aksaray towards the western suburbs, reaching Atatürk Airport in the southwest in 2002. Construction of the M2, began on September 11, 1992, but faced many challenges due to the numerous archaeological sites that were discovered during the drilling process, which slowed down or fully stopped the construction of many stations especially at south. Taking into account the seismic activity in Istanbul, the entire network was built with the cut-and-cover method to withstand an earthquake of up to 9.0 on the Richter magnitude scale.\u000aThe first section between Taksim and 4. Levent entered service, after some delays, on September 16, 2000. This line is 8.5 km (5.3 mi) long and has 6 stations, which all look similar but are in different colours. In 2000, there were 8 Alstom-built 4-car train sets in service, which ran every 5 minutes on average and transported 130,000 passengers daily. On January 30, 2009, the first train sets built by Eurotem entered service. Eurotem will build a total of 92 new wagons for the M2 line. As of January 30, 2009, a total of 34 trainsets, each with 4 cars, were being used on the M2 line. A northern extension from 4. Levent to Maslak was opened on January 30, 2009. On September 2, 2010 the northern (temporary) terminus Darü\u015f\u015fafaka followed. The southern extension of the M2 line from Taksim to Yenikap\u0131, across the Golden Horn via Haliç station on the bridge and underground through the historic peninsula, entered service on 15 February 2014. The Taksim-Yenikap\u0131 extension is 5.2 km long, with four stations. The total cost of the extension was $593 million. At Yenikap\u0131 it will intersect with the extended M1 line and the Marmaray commuter line.\u000a\u000aThe trip between the \u015ei\u015fhane station in Beyo\u011flu and the Haciosman station in Maslak is 20 km (12.4 mi) long and takes 27 minutes; including \u015ei\u015fhane - Taksim (1.65 km, 2 minutes), Taksim - 4. Levent (8.5 km, 12 minutes), and 4. Levent - Haciosman (8.1 km, 12 minutes.) The total length of the European side of the M2 line will reach 23 km (14.3 mi) when all 16 stations from Hac\u0131osman to Yenikap\u0131 will be completed; not including the 936 metres long Golden Horn Metro Bridge, the 0.6 km long Taksim-Kabata\u015f tunnel connection with the Seabus port, and the 0.6 km long Yenikap\u0131-Aksaray tunnel connecting the M1 line to the Yenikap\u0131 Transfer Center.\u000aOn the Asian side, construction is in progress of the remaining portion of the 26.5 km (16.5 mi) long M4 line from Kad\u0131köy to Kaynarca, yielding a total of 19 stations. It cost \u20ac 751 million and was built by the Astaldi / Makyol / Gülermak consortium. The first section opened on August 17, 2012, terminating in Kartal. Construction of the 20 km (12.4 mi) long M5 line from Üsküdar via Ümraniye to Sancaktepe started in March 2012.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Operations ==\u000aThe Metro operates from 06:00 a.m. to 00.00 a.m. every 6\u201310 minutes. M2 Yenikap\u0131 - Hac\u0131osman operates from 06:00 a.m. to 00.00 a.m. line During peak-hours the intervals reduce to 3 minutes. There is a flat fare \u2013 2.30 TL with Istanbulkart only (4 TL with token), paid in tokens (which are also valid on the funicular, modern tram, buses and trans-Bosporus ferry boats). Akbil tickets/cards are also valid, which is the most popular method for long distance traveling. The Akbil ticket is valid on all metros, trams, funiculars, ferry boats and buses. Ferryboat and bus fares are not flat, so the price of this transfer ticket also varies depending on the distance to be covered on bus or ferryboat.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Lines ==\u000a\u000aThis table lists the metro lines currently in service on the Istanbul Metro. An additional four lines are under-construction or planned.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Stations ==\u000a\u000aThe Istanbul Metro system has a total of 79 stations in operation with 50 more under construction. Since the majority of the system is underground, stations are generally accessed going down from street level. At every entrance to the metro is a post with the Istanbul metro "M" logo and the station name underneath it. Entrances are usually built into sidewalks along a street, although many stations of newer lines have their entrances from street level on small plazas.\u000aOut of the 79 operating stations of the Istanbul Metro,\u000a63 are fully underground\u000a5 are elevated stations\u000a9 are on an embankment or at-grade\u000a2 are partially underground\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Mezzanines ===\u000aMost stations have a mezzanine directly below street level, which allow passengers to enter the stations from multiple locations and proceed to the correct platform without having to cross any streets. Inside the mezzanines are ticket machines and turnstiles, where passengers must pay to enter fare control zones and proceed to the trains. In some stations, mezzanines connect directly to nearby buildings and structures, such as shopping malls or business centers. Each station concourse or mezzanine are patrolled by Istanbul Metro security guards to prevent fare evasion and crime.\u000aStations with large walkways toward different exits, such as Taksim also have travelators to cover the long walking distances.\u000aUpon entering the station, passenger may use ticket vending machines or manned ticket booths to purchase their fare, which can be stored on the Istanbulkart contactless smart card. After entering the fare-controlled area, via the turnstiles, passengers may continue further down to the platform level.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Platforms ===\u000a\u000aSince the different lines of the Istanbul Metro have different specifications, most notably car length, there is no uniform length for platforms. The oldest platforms of the network, built between 1989 and 2002 on the M1 line, are 100 m (330 ft) and can accommodate trains up to 4 cars long. Platforms on the M2, M3 and M4 lines span about 150 m (490 ft) and can each accommodate trains up to 8 cars long. Platforms on the M5 line can accommodate up to 6-car trains, whiles platforms on the M6 line accommodate 4-car trains.\u000aSections of platforms are subject to close during off-peak hours, especially on the M2 line. While platforms on the M2 line are open fully during peak hours, capacity is reduced to 4-car trains during off-peak hours. Platforms on the M5 line are protected by glass barriers, with doors that open only when a train is in the station. Except on funicular lines, most platforms of the Istanbul Metro consist of two side platforms or one island platform. Five stations consist of two island platforms, serving three tracks. These station are Otogar on the M1 line, Yenikap\u0131 and Sanayi on the M2 line, Olimpiyat on the M3 line, and Bostanc\u0131 on the M4 line.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Technical specifications ==\u000aThis table lists technical characteristics of the metro lines that are currently in service or under construction.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Alignment and interchanges ==\u000aThe lines have no connection between them. Apart from the Haliç station on the M2 line and about half of the M1 (mostly M1A) line, the lines are fully underground. All station names are on the bus lines as well.\u000aThe M2 line has an interchange between F1 in Taksim and an interchange tunnel with the Zincirlikuyu Metrobus station at the Gayrettepe station. There is also a transfer station at Yenikap\u0131 with Marmaray, M1 line and \u0130DO Ferry Port; from where it is possible to take the high-speed catamaran Seabus departing for Bursa, Band\u0131rma or Yalova; as well as the other Seabus ports of \u0130stanbul such as Bostanc\u0131, Kad\u0131köy, Bak\u0131rköy and Kabata\u015f.\u000aThe M3 line has an interchange with the M1B line at the Kirazl\u0131 station.\u000aThe M4 line has a vapur (traditional ferry), motorboat, \u0130DO and nostalgic tram interchange at Kad\u0131köy which is the heart of \u0130stanbul's Asian side. One can also interchange to Marmaray at the Ayr\u0131l\u0131k Ce\u015fmesi station. Also at Ünalan / Uzunçay\u0131r, the line has a Metrobus interchange just like Gayrettepe in M2.\u000aThe M5 line has an interchange with the Marmaray and \u0130DO at the Üsküdar station. Also at Altunizade the line has a Metrobus interchange.\u000aThe M6 line has an interchange with the M2 line at the Levent station.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Rolling stock ==\u000a\u000aAlthough line M1 is a (light) metro line, its rolling stock\u2014in use since 1989\u2014is made up of typical ABB light rail vehicles (LRVs). These are partly the same as those used on the T4 tramway line.\u000aThe first Istanbul full metro rolling stocks, which entered service on September 16, 2000 on the Taksim - 4. Levent line, were built by Alstom. These trains are air conditioned and equipped with LCD screens. On January 30, 2009, the first 8 trains (each with 4 wagons) built by Eurotem (the Turkish factory of Hyundai Rotem) entered service. Today the system has 268 trains. These trains are also air conditioned and equipped with LCD screens, as well as dynamic route map showing the location and direction of the train.\u000aIn September 2009, CAF signed a contract to supply 144 units for the M4 line, amounting to 1.156.159 euros. These metro units are formed with 4 cars for a total length of 90 meters and have a maximum transport capacity of 1300 passengers.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Future extensions ==\u000a\u000aAs part of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality's goal of expanding the size of the city's rail transportation network to 1,023 km (636 mi) by the end of the 2020s, the Istanbul Metro has several lines that, as of 2018, are under construction or planned. Since the city does not have a widespread railway network, the Metropolitan Municipality aims to connect urban areas of the city that do not have access the Istanbul's two coastal railways with metro lines.\u000aBy 2019, the Municipality aims to open five new metro lines and complete extensions of three existing metro lines. By 2023 the Municipality aims to open three more new lines and complete extensions of six other lines.\u000aConstruction of the following metro lines are under construction:\u000aConstruction of the following metro lines are planned or on hold:\u000a\u000a\u000a=== European side ===\u000aM3 metro line extension \u000aBak\u0131rköy\u2013Kirazl\u0131 metro line.

Visser stated in 2011 that he wished to play for Scotland when he became eligible in June 2012. Scotland coach Andy Robinson named Visser to the 28-player squad for Scotland's tour of Oceania in June 2012. He completed his three years of residency on 12 June and thus was not available for the match in Australia on 5 June, but was available for their two remaining tests against Fiji and Samoa.\u000aVisser made his Scotland debut against Fiji on 16 June and scored two tries in a 37\u201325 win. Visser made his home debut against New Zealand on 11 November 2012 during the autumn internationals, scoring two tries.\u000aTwo tries in the defeat of Italy in August 2015 helped Visser clinch a place in the 31-man squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\u000a\u000a\u000a== International tries ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Awards/Records ==\u000aCeltic League Dream Team 2009\u201310\u000aCeltic League Dream Team 2010\u201311\u000aPro12 Dream Team 2011\u201312\u000aCeltic League Young Player of the Year 2009\u201310\u000aPro12 Players' Player of the Year 2011\u201312\u000aMost tries scored by a player in one Celtic League/Pro12 season \u2013 14\u000aRecord Edinburgh try scorer with 59 tries (in all competitions Pro12, Heineken Cup, and Challenge Cup)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aTim Visser on Twitter \u000aOfficial website Tim Visser\u000aNewcastle profile\u000aEdinburgh profile\u000aRaboDirect Pro12 Profile\u000aHeineken Cup Profile\u000aESPN Scrum profile

aV"Gotta Be Somebody" is the first official single released from Nickelback's sixth studio album, Dark Horse. Originally, the lead single from the album was set to be "If Today Was Your Last Day" but was changed instead to "Gotta Be Somebody". The song was digitally delivered to all formats on September 29, 2008. "Gotta Be Somebody" has been covered by American country music singer Bucky Covington in 2009, and English pop singer Shayne Ward in 2010. It was used in a video package for the 2008 WWE Tribute to the Troops show.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Music video ==\u000aIn October 2008, it was reported that an official video from the commercial shoot had been shot with director Jessy Terrero. However, after claims that the band was dissatisfied with the video, it was scrapped. A new video was shot in Vancouver with long-time collaborator Nigel Dick, three months after the release of the single. The video debuted at AOL on Monday, December 15, 2008. The video for "Gotta Be Somebody" starts out in Outer Space, showing various planets before zooming in on Earth. Nickelback is shown playing at the Colosseum in Rome, which is empty. During the chorus, an earthquake comes and cracks the ground the band is standing on. The band is then shown playing on the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City. Again, an earthquake begins during the chorus and the band is finally shown playing an outdoor concert to fans in a Southwestern United States desert inside an Aircraft boneyard. The video swept the 2009 MuchMusic Video Awards, winning awards for best video, best rock video and best post production.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Charts ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Weekly charts ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Year-end charts ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Track listing ==\u000aInternational CD Single\u000a"Gotta Be Somebody"\u000a"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting"\u000aJapanese Promo "Best of" EP \u000a"Gotta Be Somebody (Edit)\u000a"Photograph"\u000a"Far Away"\u000a"If Everyone Cared"\u000a"Rockstar"\u000a"Someday"\u000a"Feelin' Way Too Damn Good"\u000a"How You Remind Me"\u000a"Too Bad"\u000a"Breathe"\u000a"Leader Of Men"\u000a"Gotta Be Somebody (Album Version)"\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bucky Covington version ==\u000aCountry artist Bucky Covington released a version of the song as his fifth single on October 19, 2009.

In an interview with Digital Spy Shayne Ward spoke about the decision to release a cover song as the album's lead single: "The whole transition from being rock to pop/R&B was really exciting for me and it's definitely made it into my own track. It's the perfect first single to kick-start my Obsession album. I don't look it as a cover. It's just a great song. I hadn't heard the song for a while before I recorded it, but I got into it again straight away because it's got such a catchy chorus." According to Ward, the song is about hope, "It's got a great message too - it's about hope, that there's someone out there for all of us. The music video for the single was shot in Los Angeles on 27 September 2010, and was directed by Bille Woodruff. The video for "Gotta Be Somebody" premiered on YouTube on October 29, 2010.

aVThe Masters Tournament, also known as The Masters or The US Masters, is one of the four major championships in professional golf. Scheduled for the first full week of April, the Masters is the first major of the year, and unlike the others, it is held at the same location, Augusta National Golf Club, a private course in the southeastern United States, in city of Augusta, Georgia.\u000aThe Masters was started by noted amateur champion Bobby Jones and investment banker Clifford Roberts. After his grand slam in 1930, Jones acquired the former plant nursery and co-designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie. First played 84 years ago in 1934, the tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\u000aThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\u000aNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. Palmer and Tiger Woods won four each, and five have won three titles at Augusta: Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Nick Faldo, and Phil Mickelson. Player, from South Africa, was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in 1961; the second was Seve Ballesteros of Spain, the champion in 1980 and 1983.\u000aThe Augusta National course first opened 85 years ago in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Augusta National Golf Club ===\u000a\u000aThe idea for Augusta National originated with Bobby Jones, who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game. He sought advice from Clifford Roberts, who later became the chairman of the club. They came across a piece of land in Augusta, Georgia, of which Jones said: "Perfect! And to think this ground has been lying here all these years waiting for someone to come along and lay a golf course upon it." The land had been an indigo plantation in the early nineteenth century and a plant nursery since 1857. Jones hired Alister MacKenzie to help design the course, and work began in 1931. The course formally opened in 1933, but MacKenzie died before the first Masters Tournament was played.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Early tournament years ===\u000aThe first "Augusta National Invitational" Tournament, as the Masters was originally known, began on March 22, 1934, and was won by Horton Smith, who took the first prize of $1,500. The present name was adopted in 1939. The first tournament was played with current holes 10 through 18 played as the first nine, and 1 through 9 as the second nine then reversed permanently to its present layout for the 1935 tournament.\u000aInitially the Augusta National Invitational field was composed of Bobby Jones' close associates. Jones had petitioned the USGA to hold the U.S. Open at Augusta but the USGA denied the petition, noting that the hot Georgia summers would create difficult playing conditions.\u000aGene Sarazen hit the "shot heard 'round the world" in 1935, holing a shot from the fairway on the par 5 15th for a double eagle (albatross). This tied Sarazen with Craig Wood, and in the ensuing 36-hole playoff Sarazen was the victor by five strokes. The tournament was not played from 1943 to 1945, due to World War II. To assist the war effort, cattle and turkeys were raised on the Augusta National grounds.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1960s\u20131970s ===\u000aThe Big Three of Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, and Jack Nicklaus dominated the Masters from 1960 through 1978, winning the event 11 times among them during that span. After winning by one stroke in 1958, Palmer won by one stroke again in 1960 in memorable circumstances. Trailing Ken Venturi by one shot in the 1960 event, Palmer made birdies on the last two holes to prevail. Palmer would go on to win another two Masters in 1962 and 1964.\u000a\u000aJack Nicklaus emerged in the early 1960s, and served as a rival to the popular Palmer. Nicklaus won his first green jacket in 1963, defeating Tony Lema by one stroke. Two years later, he shot a then-course record of 271 (17 under par) for his second Masters win, leading Bobby Jones to say that Nicklaus played "a game with which I am not familiar." The next year, Nicklaus won his third green jacket in a grueling 18-hole playoff against Tommy Jacobs and Gay Brewer. This made Nicklaus the first player to win consecutive Masters. He won again in 1972 by three strokes. In 1975, Nicklaus won by one stroke in a close contest with Tom Weiskopf and Johnny Miller in one of the most exciting Masters to date.\u000aGary Player became the first non-American to win the Masters in 1961, beating Palmer, the defending champion. In 1974, he won again by two strokes. After not winning a tournament on the U.S. PGA tour for nearly four years, and at the age of 42, Player won his third and final Masters in 1978 by one stroke over three players. Player currently shares (with Fred Couples) the record of making 23 consecutive cuts, and has played in a record 52 Masters.\u000aA controversial ending to the Masters occurred in 1968. Roberto De Vicenzo signed a scorecard (scored by playing partner Tommy Aaron) which incorrectly showed him as making a par 4 instead of a birdie 3 on the 17th hole of the final round. By the rules of golf, if a player signs a scorecard (thereby attesting to its veracity) that records a score on a hole higher than what he actually made on the hole, the player receives the higher score for that hole. This extra stroke cost De Vicenzo a chance to be in an 18-hole Monday playoff with Bob Goalby, who won the green jacket. De Vicenzo's mistake led to the famous quote, "What a stupid I am."\u000aIn 1975, Lee Elder became the first African American to play in the Masters, doing so 15 years before Augusta National admitted its first black member, Ron Townsend, as a result of the Shoal Creek Controversy.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1980s\u20132000s ===\u000aNon-Americans collected 11 victories in 20 years in the 1980s and 1990s, by far the strongest run they have had in any of the three majors played in the United States since the early days of the U.S. Open. The first European to win the Masters was Seve Ballesteros in 1980. Nicklaus became the oldest player to win the Masters in 1986 when he won for the sixth time at age 46.\u000aDuring this period, no golfer suffered from the pressure of competing at Augusta more than Greg Norman. In 1987, Norman lost a sudden-death playoff to Larry Mize when Mize holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole and win the Masters. In 1996, Norman tied the course record with an opening round 63, and had a six-stroke lead over Nick Faldo entering the final round. Norman shot a 78 while Faldo scored a 67 to win by five shots (for his third Masters championship). Norman also suffered in 1986 when after birdieing four straight holes, and needing only a par to tie Nicklaus for the lead and force a Monday playoff, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 and missed his par putt for a closing bogey.\u000aAt age 21 in 1997, Tiger Woods won the Masters by twelve shots and broke the 72-hole record that had stood for 32 years. Woods completed his "Tiger Slam" by winning his fourth straight major championship at the Masters in 2001. He won again the following year, making him only the third player in history to win the tournament in consecutive years, as well as in 2005 when he defeated Chris DiMarco in a playoff for his first major championship win in almost three years.\u000aThe club was targeted by Martha Burk, who organized a failed protest at the 2003 Masters to pressure the club into accepting female members. Burk planned to protest at the front gates of Augusta National during the third day of the tournament, but her application for a permit to do so was denied. A court appeal was dismissed. In 2004, Burk stated that she had no further plans to protest against the club.\u000aAugusta National Chairman Billy Payne himself made headlines in April 2010, however, when he commented (at the annual pre-Masters press conference) on Tiger Woods' off-the-course behavior. "It's not simply the degree of his conduct that is so egregious here," Payne said, in his opening speech. "It is the fact he disappointed all of us and more importantly our kids and grandkids."\u000aThe 2003 tournament was won by Mike Weir, who became the first Canadian to win a men's major championship, and the first left-hander to win the Masters. The following year, another left-hander, Phil Mickelson, won his first major championship by making a birdie on the final hole to beat Ernie Els by a stroke. Mickelson also won the tournament in 2006 and 2010. In 2011, the tournament was won by South African Charl Schwartzel, who birdied the final four holes to win by two strokes. In 2012, Bubba Watson won the tournament on the second playoff hole. Watson's win marked the fifth time that a left-hander won the Masters in the previous ten tournaments. Prior to 2003, no left-hander had ever won the Masters. The 2013 Masters was won by Adam Scott, the first Australian to win the tournament. Watson won the 2014 Masters by three strokes over Jordan Spieth and Jonas Blixt. It was his second Masters victory in three years. In 2015, Spieth would become the second-youngest winner in just his second Masters.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Traditions ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Awards ===\u000aThe total prize money for the 2014 tournament was $9,000,000, with $1,620,000 going to the winner. In the inaugural year of 1934, the winner Horton Smith received $1,500 out of a $5,000 purse. After Nicklaus's first win in 1963, he received $20,000, while after his final victory in 1986 he won $144,000. In recent years the purse has grown quickly. Between 2001 and 2014, the winner's share grew by $612,000, and the purse grew by $3,400,000.\u000aIn addition to a cash prize, the winner of the tournament is presented with a distinctive green jacket, formally awarded since 1949, and informally acquired by the champions for many years before that. The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the spectators. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\u000aThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket); Seve Ballesteros who, in an interview with Peter Alliss from his home in Pedreña, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and Henry Picard, whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in Beachwood, Ohio, where he was the club professional for many years.\u000aBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament. In 1966, Jack Nicklaus became the first player to win in consecutive years and he donned the jacket himself. When Nick Faldo (in 1990) and Tiger Woods (in 2002) repeated as champions, the chairman of Augusta National put the jacket on them.\u000aThere are several awards presented to players who perform exceptional feats during the tournament. The player who has the daily lowest score receives a crystal vase, while players who score a hole-in-one or a double eagle win a large crystal bowl. For each eagle a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\u000aIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. They have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy, introduced in 1961, which depicts the clubhouse. This trophy remains at Augusta National; since 1993 winners have received a sterling silver replica. The runner-up receives a silver medal, introduced in 1951. Beginning in 1978, a silver salver was added as an award for the runner-up.\u000aIn 1952 the Masters began presenting an award, known as the Silver Cup, to the lowest scoring amateur to make the cut. In 1954 they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up.\u000aIn 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Par-3 contest ===\u000a\u000aThe Par 3 Contest was first introduced in 1960, and was won that year by Snead. Since then it has traditionally been played on the Wednesday before the tournament starts. The par 3 course was built in 1958. It is a nine-hole course, with a par of 27, and measures 1,060 yards (970 m) in length.\u000aThere have been 94 holes-in-one in the history of the contest, with a record nine occurring in 2016. Camilo Villegas became the first player to card two holes-in-one in the same round during the 2015 Par 3 Contest. No par 3 contest winner has also won the Masters in the same year. There have been several repeat winners, including Pádraig Harrington, Sandy Lyle, and Sam Snead. The former two won in successive years.\u000aIn this event, golfers may use their children as caddies, which helps to create a family-friendly atmosphere. In 2008, the event was televised for the first time by ESPN.\u000aThe winner of the par 3 competition, which is played the day before the tournament begins, wins a crystal bowl.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Player invitations ===\u000aAs with the other majors, winning the Masters gives a golfer several privileges which make his career more secure. Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and the PGA Championship) for the next five years (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters. They also receive membership on the PGA Tour for the following five seasons and invitations to The Players Championship for five years.\u000aBecause the tournament was established by an amateur champion, Bobby Jones, the Masters has a tradition of honoring amateur golf. It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current U.S. Amateur champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\u000aAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the "Crow's Nest" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is 1,200 square feet (110 m2) with lodging space for five during the competition.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Opening tee shot ===\u000aSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were Jock Hutchison and Fred McLeod; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\u000aIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter. Palmer also had the honor in 2008 and 2009. At the 2010 and 2011 Masters Tournaments, Jack Nicklaus joined Palmer as an honorary co-starter for the event. In 2012, Gary Player joined them. Palmer announced in March 2016 that a lingering shoulder issue would prevent him from partaking in the 2016 tee shot. Palmer was still in attendance for the ceremony.\u000aFollowing Palmer's death in 2016, the 2017 ceremony featured tributes; his green jacket was draped over an empty white chair, while everyone in attendance wore "Arnie's Army" badges.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Champions' Dinner ===\u000aThe Champions' Dinner is held each year on the Tuesday evening preceding Thursday's first round. The dinner was first held in 1952, hosted by defending champion Ben Hogan, to honor the past champions of the tournament. At that time 15 tournaments had been played, and the number of past champions was 11. Officially known as the "Masters Club", it includes only past winners of the Masters, although selected members of the Augusta National Golf Club have been included as honorary members, usually the chairman.\u000aThe defending champion, as host, selects the menu for the dinner. Frequently, Masters champions have served finely prepared cuisine by the Masters chef from their home regions. Notable examples have included haggis, served by Scotsman Sandy Lyle in 1989, and bobotie, a South African dish, served at the behest of 2008 champion Trevor Immelman. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion Fuzzy Zoeller created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of Phil Mickelson was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that Seve Ballesteros would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died weeks later.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Caddies ===\u000aUntil 1983, all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club caddie, who by club tradition was always an African American man. Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, "As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black." Since 1983, players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\u000aThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes. The surname, and sometimes first initial, of each player is found on the back of his caddie's uniform. The defending champion always receives caddie number "1": other golfers get their caddie numbers from the order in which they register for the tournament. The other majors and some PGA Tour events formerly had a similar policy concerning caddies well into the 1970s; the U.S. Open first allowed players to use their own caddies in 1976.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Other traditions ===\u000aThe day after the tournament closes, The Bobby Jones Scholars from The University of St Andrews in Scotland play a four-ball round on the course \u2013 the last people to do so before the greenkeepers start the process of repairing and restoring the course to pre-tournament standard.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Format ==\u000aThe Masters is the first major championship of the year. Since 1948, its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times (1952, 1957, 1958, 1959) and the 1979 and 1984 tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday. The first edition in 1934 was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the 1942 event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.\u000aSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.\u000aAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To "make the cut", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since 2013. From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead. Before 1957, there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.\u000aFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a sudden-death playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains. Adopted in 1976, the sudden-death playoff was originally formatted to start on the first hole, but was not needed for the first three years. It was changed for 1979 to the inward (final) nine holes, starting at the tenth tee, where the television coverage began. First employed that same year, the Masters' first sudden-death playoff ended on the eleventh green. The current arrangement, beginning at the 18th tee, was amended for 2004 and first used the following year. Through 2017, the eleven sudden-death playoffs have yet to advance past the second extra hole. Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in 1935, which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in 1970, and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Course ==\u000aThe golf course was formerly a plant nursery and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.\u000aThe course layout in 2014:\u000aLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\u000aThe course was lengthened to 7,445 yards (6,808 m) in 2006. The first hole was shortened\u000aby 10 yards (9 m) in 2009, resulting in the current length of 7,435 yards (6,799 m).\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Course adjustments ===\u000aAs with many other courses, Augusta National's championship setup was lengthened in recent years. In 2001, the course measured 6,925 yards (6,332 m) and was extended to 7,270 yards (6,648 m) for 2002, and again in 2006 to 7,445 yards (6,808 m); 520 yards (475 m) longer than the 2001 course. The changes attracted many critics, including the most successful players in Masters history, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Tiger Woods. Woods claimed that the "shorter hitters are going to struggle." Augusta National chairman Hootie Johnson was unperturbed, stating, "We are comfortable with what we are doing with the golf course." After a practice round, Gary Player defended the changes, saying, "There have been a lot of criticisms, but I think unjustly so, now I've played it.... The guys are basically having to hit the same second shots that Jack Nicklaus had to hit (in his prime)".\u000aOriginally, the grass on the putting greens was the wide-bladed Bermuda. The greens lost speed, especially during the late 1970s, after the introduction of a healthier strain of narrow-bladed Bermuda, which thrived and grew thicker. In 1978, the greens on the par 3 course were reconstructed with bentgrass, a narrow-bladed species that could be mowed shorter, eliminating grain. After this test run, the greens on the main course were replaced with bentgrass in time for the 1981 Masters. The bentgrass resulted in significantly faster putting surfaces, which has required a reduction in some of the contours of the greens over time.\u000aJust before the 1975 tournament, the common beige sand in the bunkers was replaced with the now-signature white feldspar. It is a quartz derivative of the mining of feldspar and is shipped in from North Carolina.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Field ==\u000aThe Masters has the smallest field of the major championships, with 90\u2013100 players. Unlike other majors, there are no alternates or qualifying tournaments. It is an invitational event, with invitations largely issued on an automatic basis to players who meet published criteria. The top 50 players in the Official World Golf Ranking are all invited.\u000aPast champions are always eligible, but since 2002 the Augusta National Golf Club has discouraged them from continuing to participate at an advanced age. Some will later become honorary starters.\u000aInvitation categories\u000aSee footnote.\u000aNote: Categories 6\u201310 are honored only if the participants maintain their amateur status prior to the tournament.\u000aMasters Tournament Champions (lifetime)\u000aU.S. Open champions (five years)\u000aThe Open champions (five years)\u000aPGA champions (five years)\u000aWinners of the Players Championship (three years)\u000aCurrent U.S. Amateur champion and runner-up\u000aCurrent British Amateur champion\u000aCurrent Asia-Pacific Amateur champion\u000aCurrent U.S. Mid-Amateur champion\u000aCurrent Latin America Amateur champion\u000aThe first 12 players, including ties, in the previous year's Masters Tournament\u000aThe first 4 players, including ties, in the previous year's U.S. Open\u000aThe first 4 players, including ties, in the previous year's Open Championship\u000aThe first 4 players, including ties, in the previous year's PGA Championship\u000aWinners of PGA Tour regular-season and playoff events that award at least a full-point allocation for the FedEx Cup, starting with the RBC Heritage the week after the Masters to the Shell Houston Open the week beforehand.\u000aThose qualifying for the previous year's season-ending Tour Championship (top 30 in FedEx Cup prior to tournament)\u000aThe 50 leaders on the Final Official World Golf Ranking for the previous calendar year\u000aThe 50 leaders on the Official World Golf Ranking published during the week prior to the current Masters Tournament\u000aMost of the top current players will meet the criteria of multiple categories for invitation. The Masters Committee, at its discretion, can also invite any golfer not otherwise qualified, although in practice these invitations are currently reserved for international players.\u000aChanges since 2014\u000aChanges for the 2014 tournament include invitations now being awarded to the autumn events in the PGA Tour, which now begin the wraparound season, tightening of qualifications (top 12 plus ties from the Masters, top 4 from the U.S. Open, Open Championship, and PGA Championship), and the top 30 on the PGA Tour now referencing the season-ending points before the Tour Championship, not the former annual money list. The 2015 Masters added the winner of the newly established Latin America Amateur Championship, which effectively replaced the exemption for the United States Amateur Public Links Championship, which ended after the 2014 tournament. (The final Public Links champion played in the 2015 Masters.)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Champions ==\u000a\u000aThe first winner of the Masters Tournament was Horton Smith in 1934, and he repeated in 1936. The player with the most Masters victories is Jack Nicklaus, who won six times between 1963 and 1986. Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods have each won four, and Jimmy Demaret, Gary Player, Sam Snead, Nick Faldo, and Phil Mickelson have three titles to their name. Player was the tournament's first overseas winner with his first victory in 1961. Two-time champions include Byron Nelson, Ben Hogan, Tom Watson, Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, Ben Crenshaw, José María Olazábal, and Bubba Watson.\u000aIn the "Runner(s)-up" column, the years are sorted alphabetically, based on the name of the country of (1) that year's runner-up or (2) the first player listed, in years that have multiple runners-up.\u000aThe sudden-death format was adopted in 1976, first used in 1979, and revised in 2004.None of the 11 sudden-death playoffs has advanced past the second hole; four were decided at the first hole, seven at the second.\u000a\u000aPlayoffs prior to 1976 were full 18-hole rounds, except for 1935, which was 36 holes.\u000aNone of the 6 full-round playoffs were tied at the end of the round; the closest margin was one stroke in 1942 and 1954.\u000aThe 1962 playoff included three players Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Dow Finsterwald. Palmer won the playoff with a round of 68, Player finished 2nd with a 71 and Finsterwald finished 3rd with a 77.\u000aThe 1966 playoff included three players Jack Nicklaus, Tommy Jacobs and Gay Brewer. Nicklaus won the playoff with a round of 70, Jacobs finished 2nd with a 72 and Brewer finished 3rd with a 78.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Low amateurs ==\u000aIn 1952 the Masters began presenting an award, known as the Silver Cup, to the lowest-scoring amateur to make the cut. In 1954 they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up. There have been six players to win low amateur and then go on to win the Masters as a professional. These players are Cary Middlecoff, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Crenshaw, Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods and Sergio García.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Records ==\u000aJack Nicklaus has won the most Masters (six) and was 46 years, 82 days old when he won in 1986, making him the oldest winner of the Masters. Nicklaus is the record holder for the most top tens, with 22, and the most cuts made, with 37. The youngest winner of the Masters is Tiger Woods, who was 21 years, 104 days old when he won in 1997. In that year Woods also broke the records for the widest winning margin (12 strokes), and the lowest winning score, with 270 (\u221218). Jordan Spieth tied his score record in 2015.\u000aIn 2013, Guan Tianlang became the youngest player ever to compete in the Masters, at age 14 years, 168 days on the opening day of the tournament; the following day, he became the youngest ever to make the cut at the Masters or any men's major championship.\u000aGary Player holds the record for most appearances, with 52. Player also holds the record for the number of consecutive cuts made, with 23 between 1959 and 1982 (Player did not compete in 1973 as he was recovering from recent surgery). He shares this record with Fred Couples, who made his consecutive cuts between 1983 and 2007, not competing in 1987 and 1994.\u000aNick Price and Greg Norman share the course record of 63, with their rounds coming in 1986 and 1996 respectively.\u000aThe highest winning score of 289 (+1) has occurred three times: Sam Snead in 1954, Jack Burke, Jr. in 1956, and Zach Johnson in 2007. Anthony Kim holds the record for most birdies in a round with 11 in 2009 during his second round.\u000aThere have been only four double eagles carded in the history of the Masters; the latest was by a contender in the fourth round in 2012. In the penultimate pairing with eventual champion Bubba Watson, Louis Oosthuizen's 260-yard (238 m) downhill 4 iron from the fairway made the left side of the green at the par-5 second hole, called Pink Dogwood, rolled downhill, and in. The other two rare occurrences of this feat after Sarazen's double eagle on the fabled course's Fire Thorn hole in 1935: Bruce Devlin made double eagle from 248 yards (227 m) out with a 4-wood at the eighth hole (Yellow Jasmine) in the first round in 1967, while Jeff Maggert hit a 3-iron 222 yards (203 m) at the 13th hole (Azalea) in the fourth round in 1994.\u000aThree players share the record for most runner-up finishes with four: Ben Hogan (1942, 1946, 1954, 1955), Tom Weiskopf (1969, 1972, 1974, 1975), Jack Nicklaus (1964, 1971, 1977, 1981)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Broadcasting ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== United States television ===\u000aCBS has televised the Masters in the United States every year since 1956, when it used six cameras and covered only the final four holes. Tournament coverage of the first eight holes did not begin until 1993 because of resistance from the tournament organizers, but by 2006, more than 50 cameras were used. Chairman Jack Stephens felt that the back nine was always more "compelling", increased coverage would increase the need for sponsorship spending, and that broadcasting the front nine of the course on television would cut down on attendance and television viewership for the tournament. USA Network added first- and second-round coverage in 1982. The Masters has been broadcast every year in high-definition television since 2000, one of the first golf tournaments to ever hold that distinction. In 2008, ESPN replaced USA as broadcaster of early-round coverage. These broadcasts use the CBS Sports production staff and commentators, although then-ESPN personality Mike Tirico previously served as a studio host (replacing Bill Macatee's role under USA Network).\u000aIn 2005, CBS broadcast the tournament with high-definition fixed and handheld wired cameras, as well as standard-definition wireless handheld cameras. In 2006, a webstream called "Amen Corner Live" began providing coverage of all players passing through holes 11, 12, and 13 through all four rounds. This was the first full tournament multi-hole webcast from a major championship. In 2007, CBS added "Masters Extra," an extra hour of full-field bonus coverage daily on the internet, preceding the television broadcasts. In 2008, CBS added full coverage of holes 15 and 16 live on the web. In 2011, "Masters Extra" was dropped after officials gave ESPN an extra hour each day on Thursday and Friday. In 2016, the Amen Corner feed was broadcast in 4K ultra high definition exclusively on DirecTV\u2014as one of the first live U.S. sports telecasts in the format. A second channel of 4K coverage covering holes 15 and 16 was added in 2017.\u000aWhile Augusta National Golf Club has consistently chosen CBS as its U.S. broadcast partner, it has done so in successive one-year contracts. Former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson stated that their relationship had gotten to the point where they "could do our deal in hours". Due to the lack of long-term contractual security, as well as the club's limited dependence on broadcast rights fees (owing to its affluent membership), it is widely held that CBS allows Augusta National greater control over the content of the broadcast, or at least performs some form of self-censorship, in order to maintain future rights. The club, however, has insisted it does not make any demands with respect to the content of the broadcast. Despite this, announcers who have been deemed not to have acted with the decorum expected by the club have been removed, notably Jack Whitaker and Gary McCord, and there also tends to be a lack of discussion of any controversy involving Augusta National, such as the 2003 Martha Burk protests.\u000aCoverage itself carries a more formal style than other golf telecasts; announcers refer to the gallery as patrons rather than as spectators or fans. Gallery itself is also used. The club also disallows promotions for other network programs, or other forms of sponsored features. Significant restrictions have been placed on the tournament's broadcast hours compared to other major championships. Only in the 21st century did the tournament allow CBS to air 18-hole coverage of the leaders, a standard at the other three majors. Since 1982, CBS has used "Augusta" by Dave Loggins as the event telecast's distinctive theme music. Loggins originally came up with the song during his first trip to the Augusta course in 1981.\u000aThe club mandates minimal commercial interruption, currently limited to four minutes per hour (as opposed to the usual 12 or more); this is subsidized by selling exclusive sponsorship packages to three companies\u2014in 2013, these "global sponsors" were IBM, ExxonMobil and AT&T. In 2014, ExxonMobil was replaced as a global sponsor by Mercedes-Benz. The club also sells separate sponsorship packages, which do not provide rights to air commercials on the U.S. telecasts, to two "international partners"; in 2014, those companies were Rolex and UPS (the latter of which replaced Mercedes-Benz upon that company's elevation to "global sponsor" status). In the immediate aftermath of the Martha Burk controversy, there were no commercials during the 2003 and 2004 U.S. broadcasts.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Radio coverage ===\u000aWestwoodOne (previously Dial Global and CBS Radio) has provided live radio play-by-play coverage in the United States since 1956. This coverage can also be heard on the official Masters website. The network provides short two- or three-minute updates throughout the tournament, as well as longer three- and four-hour segments towards the end of the day.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== International television ===\u000aThe BBC has broadcast the Masters in the UK since 1986, and it also provides live radio commentary on the closing stages on Radio Five Live. With the 2007 launch of BBC HD, UK viewers can now watch the championship in that format. BBC Sport held the TV and radio rights through to 2010. The BBC's coverage airs without commercials because it is financed by a licence fee. From the 2011 Masters, Sky Sports began broadcasting all four days, as well as the par 3 contest in HD and, for the first time ever, in 3D. The BBC will only have highlights of the first two days' play but will go head to head with Sky Sports, with full live coverage on the final two days of play. In Ireland, Setanta Ireland previously showed all four rounds, and now since 2017 Eir Sport broadcast all four rounds live having previously broadcast the opening two rounds with RTÉ broadcasting the weekend coverage.\u000aIn Canada, broadcast rights to the Masters are held by Bell Media, with coverage divided between TSN (cable), which carries live simulcasts and primetime encores of CBS and ESPN coverage for all four rounds, CTV (broadcast), which simulcasts CBS's coverage of the weekend rounds, and RDS, which carries French-language coverage. Prior to 2013, Canadian broadcast rights were held by a marketing company, Graham Sanborn Media, which in turn bought time on the Global Television Network, TSN, and RDS (except for 2012 when French-language coverage aired on TVA and TVA Sports) to air the broadcasts, also selling all of the advertising for the Canadian broadcasts. This was an unusual arrangement in Canadian sports broadcasting, as in most cases broadcasters acquire their rights directly from the event organizers or through partnerships with international rightsholders, such as ESPN International (ESPN owns a minority stake in TSN). In 2013, Global and TSN began selling advertising directly, and jointly produced their own preview and highlights shows for Canadian audiences (while still carrying ESPN/CBS coverage for the tournament itself).\u000aOn December 15, 2015, TSN parent company Bell Media announced that it had acquired exclusive Canadian rights to The Masters beginning 2016 under a multi-year deal. Broadcast television coverage will move to co-owned broadcast network CTV, while TSN uses its expanded five-channel service to carry supplemental feeds (including the Amen Corner feed and early coverage of each round) that were previously exclusive to digital platforms.\u000aIn 53 countries, including much of Latin America, broadcast rights for the entire tournament are held by the ESPN International networks.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Ticketing ==\u000aAlthough tickets for the Masters are not expensive, they are very difficult to come by. Even the practice rounds can be difficult to get into. Applications for practice round tickets have to be made nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot. Tickets to the actual tournament are sold only to members of a patrons list, which is closed. A waiting list for the patrons list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978. It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again. In 2008, the Masters also began allowing children (between the ages of 8 and 16) to enter on tournament days free if they are accompanied by the patron who is the owner of his or her badge.\u000aThe difficulty in acquiring Masters badges has made the tournament one of the largest events on the secondary-ticket market. A majority of the badges for the Masters are delivered to the same group of patrons, fans, and members each year, and these perennial ticket holders sometimes decide to sell their badges through large ticket marketplaces such as StubHub, TicketCity, and VividSeats. Some of these marketplaces will allow fans to purchase a Masters badge for a single day, as opposed to the traditional 4-day pass.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000a Men's major professional golf championships \u2013 Wikipedia book\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial website\u000aMasters Tournament on Facebook\u000aMasters Tournament on Instagram\u000aAugusta.com \u2013 coverage by The Augusta Chronicle

aVRoyal Air Force Angle, or RAF Angle, is a former Royal Air Force station. Located on the Angle Peninsula Coast, 8 miles (13 km) west of Pembroke, Pembrokeshire, Wales, it was operational from 1 December 1941 to the 1950s, having been used by both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Navy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aIt was initially used by No. 32 Squadron RAF flying the Hawker Hurricane I. In November 1941 they were replaced by 615 Squadron, and the Hurricane IIC. Several Squadrons followed: 312 Squadron flew the Supermarine Spitfire VB and 263 Squadron with the Westland Whirlwind.\u000aNext No. 152 Squadron RAF, No. 412 Squadron RCAF and No. 421 Squadron RCAF squadrons occupied the base, flying the Spitfire VB.\u000aDuring May 1943 794 Naval Air Squadron were posted here conducting target towing and the control of the airfield was transferred to the Royal Navy with the site being renamed RNAS Angle (HMS Goldcrest). However in September 1943 the Royal Navy moved from RNAS Angle to the RNAS Dale, and the RAF swapped sites in the other direction with the Coastal Command Development Unit moving in.\u000aThe airfield was used as the base for trials of the prototype Highball bouncing bomb on 6 October 1943 using a tunnel at Maenclochog as a target. Highball was a spherical design with dimples by Barnes Wallis and were dropped by de Havilland Mosquito aircraft.\u000aOther units based at Angle were:\u000aNo. 1 (Coastal) Engine Control Demonstration Unit\u000aCoastal Command Development Unit from 1943 \u000aEngine Control Instructional Flight\u000aBetween 1945 and the 1950s Angle was used as a Relief Landing Ground for Fleet Air Arm aircraft based at RNAS Brawdy.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Posted squadrons ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Current use ==\u000aThe site has reverted to farming and only a few huts and the perimeter track are left.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of former Royal Air Force stations\u000aAngle, Pembrokeshire\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Citations ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Bibliography ===\u000aJefford, C.G, MBE, BA, RAF (Retd).

aVHarold Legg (credited as Dr Legg) is a fictional character from the British soap opera EastEnders, played by Leonard Fenton. Dr Legg is Walford's original GP. He is widely trusted within the community, and is always on hand to dish out advice. Dr Legg appears as a regular character between 1985 and 1989, but continues to appear in a recurring role until 1997. He was officially retired in 1999 by executive producer Matthew Robinson, though he has made cameos since this time in 2000, 2004 and 2007.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Storylines ==\u000aDr Legg first appears in EastEnders when it begins on 19 February 1985. He is the local doctor for Walford, where he had lived most of his life, opening his practice there in 1947.\u000aHis Jewish family had moved out of the East End when Oswald Mosley began his fascist marches in the 1930s. They moved to Finchley in North London, but young Harold commuted daily to his East End grammar school, to avoid any disruption to his education. He went to St. Bartholomew's hospital to start his medical training in 1940, treated air raid casualties, and met and married a non-Jewish nurse, named Judith Martin. They bought a small house in Albert Square. They lived there happily, but during the war a German bomb exploded near number 5 Albert Square and killed Judith. He never remarried, despite the hard work of matchmaking aunts and Dr Legg since devotes his life to keeping the residents of Albert Square healthy. He later moved to Islington, living there for several years, but continued to maintain his surgery in Albert Square, renting the flat upstairs to Ethel Skinner,(Gretchen Franklin) and the barman Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt), although there are an array of other tenants.\u000a\u000aAs Walford's GP, Harold is forever getting called upon to treat the troubled residents, even when he is not on duty, including helping Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff) come to terms with the death of her son, and humouring hypochondriac Dot Cotton (June Brown).\u000aIn 1988, Harold's sister, Hester, comes to Walford to visit and tells him that her son, David Samuels (Christopher Reich), is interested in joining him in Britain. As David is a doctor in Israel, Harold thinks it is a great idea and in April that year, David joins him in Walford and is made a partner in the practice. Harold even moves back to Walford and he and David live in the flat above the surgery. Despite being extremely fond of each other, the new partners argue about almost everything. David wants to modernize the surgery and bring in computers but Harold is set in his ways and is opposed to any obvious changes. Harold also disagrees with David's friendship with their secretary, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), particularly when the two get drunk at a Christmas party, leave together and share the same bed. David awakes the next day not remembering a thing, but is reassured when Michelle informs him that he had been too drunk to do anything untoward anyway. Harold is not convinced however and berates David for the degradation he brought upon himself and the surgery. Later, David and Harold fall out over Harold's treatment of patients when he discovers that Colin Russell (Michael Cashman), is showing early symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. He decides not to tell Colin as worrying about his condition could bring on another attack although Colin may not have another attack for 20 years or so, choosing instead to tell Colin that he is overworked and anemic. This highly unethical move appalls David but despite this, Harold continues to refuse to tell Colin about his illness. However, in January 1989, he finally tells Colin the truth. Colin is furious that Harold had kept this information from him and refuses to listen when he tries to explain his reasons. He threatens to report Dr Legg to the authorities and is mortified at how unethical he has been. Although Dr Legg is sorry, he stands by his decision to lie, feeling that Colin benefited from not knowing - when in fact, the opposite is true.\u000aDavid later becomes incensed by his uncle's lack of persistence concerning Donna Ludlow's (Matilda Ziegler) heroin addiction and blames him for her death later in the year. Things reach a climax in May 1989 when Dr Legg fails to diagnose Vicki Fowler's (Samantha Leigh Martin) meningitis and Vicki almost dies, consequently his practitioners no longer trust him and makes him question his abilities as a doctor, sending him into early retirement. This leaves the medical practice in the hands of his nephew but David's more modern methods prove unpopular with the older residents so Harold comes out of retirement. David tries to fight his decision but his Israeli girlfriend makes him see how futile the arguing has become. David and Harold manage to sort out their differences before David returns to Israel in September that year.\u000aDr Legg's role appears semi-regularly from this time, appearing only when another character needs medical assistance or advice. However, he remains Walford's GP. He officially retires and leaves after February 1997 and is replaced with a trendier, younger doctor named Fred Fonseca (Jimi Mistry). He makes several brief appearances since this time however, attending Ethel's funeral in September 2000 and Mark Fowler (Todd Carty)'s in April 2004. His last appearance is in June 2007, when Dot visits him when she has an hour of need. Though Harold does not appear in Walford from this time, he sends wreaths to his friends' funerals including Pauline Fowler's (Wendy Richard) in January 2007 and Frank Butcher's (Mike Reid) in March 2008. In December 2008, he telephones Dot with news of Janine Evans (Charlie Brooks), now known as Judith Bernstein, and her upcoming wedding to an elderly Jewish man.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Character creation and development ==\u000aDr Harold Legg was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Dr Legg was an attempt to represent the successive wave of Jewish immigrants that had settled in the East End of London between 1881 and 1914 in order avoid the persecution that they were being subjected to in Europe. The second generation of East End born Jews (as Dr Legg was meant to represent) prospered in the area until the 1930s when Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists was formed, and used violence to instil fear in the Jewish population. As the Jewish community grew wealthier, many moved out of the East End to more affluent areas of London, just as the character of Dr Legg had done on-screen when the show began; living in Islington, but commuting to his practice in Walford.\u000aDr Legg's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story.\u000a"His parents took the name Legg from the street they used to live in... the tough time came in the mid-thirties when the extreme right and Mosley on one hand, and the persecution of the Jews in Europe on the other, forced him as a bright teenager to become positively aware of racism, freedom and persecution. He didn't become a communist, he didn't start hating all Germans \u2014 but he did stop going to the Synagogue... he decided as he approached seventeen to become a doctor... perhaps he should have been a musician? Like his uncle Leon... He saw the air raid casualties... it reinforced his passion for the underdog... he met and fell in love with a young (non-Jewish) nurse - they were married when he was twenty-one... She was in the garden when a dog-fight took place overhead, and the German pilot dropped his bomb in order to get away. The corner of the Square went \u2014 so did she." (page 53)\u000a\u000aHolland and Smith had difficulties in casting the role of Dr Legg, as they had problems finding an actor of the right age, intelligence, and class, who could also play a Jewish professional man. Jewish actor Leonard Fenton was suggested by the writer Bill Lyons and took a great interest in the role. Holland and Smith thought that he would be perfect and he was subsequently cast as Dr Legg. Fenton has since revealed that the character was based on him. He has commented, "It wasn't easy raising a family on theatre wages, so EastEnders couldn't have come at a better time. It was the first time I had played myself on television. I'm normally a character actor, but Dr Legg was based on me."\u000aDr Legg was conveyed as a man that was trusted within the community. A traditional GP with roots in the East End, who had a genuine concern for his loyal patients and the area. The majority of his storylines concerned other characters' problems (where he was seen as the first port of call should anyone need advice or fall ill), or they related to his own professional conduct. His personal life was largely kept hidden from viewers, although he would occasionally reminisce about his and Albert Square's history, mainly with other characters supposedly born in the area, such as Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), Lou Beale (Anna Wing) and later Benny Bloom (Arnold Yarrow). The character was also featured within a series of spin-off EastEnders novels by Hugh Miller, set prior to 1985. Within the novelisation entitled Home Fires Burning, readers were made privy to the character's history as a trainee doctor during World War II, and his blossoming relationship with his would be wife, Judith.\u000aThe character served as Walford's GP for 14 years. Although his first name of Harold was revealed by the visiting DI Marsh (Harry Miller) in the final scene of the show's second episode in 1985, he has always been referred to by the majority of the other characters and in the closing credits as "Dr Legg". Though a regular character with his own storylines throughout the 1980s, for much of the 1990s he was a recurring character, making increasingly sporadic appearances, and only when other characters needed medical assistance. In 1998, the executive producer of EastEnders, Matthew Robinson, announced that he was officially retiring Dr Legg. The character was one of many axed by the producer, who was dubbed the "axeman" by the British press. Speaking of his decision, Robinson commented "Dr Legg is getting on a bit, so we're retiring him. He'll be going to a nice cottage in the country." His place was filled by a younger alternative medicine fan, Dr Fred Fonseca, played by Jimi Mistry. Leonard Fenton has since spoken about his frustration that Dr Legg did not get to practice enough, claiming that he "was frustrated for years by Dr Legg's sporadic appearances". In an interview in 2000, Fenton commented "I told them I wasn't happy about going on once every two months. That's why it ended...". Dr Legg was never given an official exit on-screen, his retirement is mentioned by Dr Fonseca in January 1999, when the character Ruth Fowler (Caroline Paterson) requests to see him.\u000aSince his retirement, Dr Legg makes several brief cameos in the soap, his returns relating to storylines concerning other long-running characters. In 2000, executive producer John Yorke brought him back for the death of Ethel Skinner, in 2004 Louise Berridge brought him back for the funeral of Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), and most recently he was brought back for one episode in 2007 by Diederick Santer, to provide counsel for the character Dot Branning (June Brown). At the time Santer commented, "Dr Legg was well-loved. I hope to get him back for at least one episode."\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of fictional doctors\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aHarold Legg at BBC Online

aVBen Dunne (born 3 March 1949, Cork) is an Irish businessman. Former director of his family firm, Dunnes Stores, one of the largest chains of department stores in Ireland, he now owns a chain of fitness centers established by his company Barkisland Developments Limited.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aIn 1981, he was kidnapped by the IRA and held for seven days. He was released unharmed.\u000aIn 1992, he was arrested for cocaine possession and soliciting while on a golf holiday in Florida, USA. His arrest triggered the end of his leadership of Dunnes Stores, as family turmoil led to control falling to his sister Margaret Heffernan and the company paying IR£100 million for Ben Dunne's share of the business.\u000aHe was again embroiled in scandal in the mid-1990s when it emerged he had given large amounts of money to a number of Irish politicians, mainly from the Fianna Fáil party including the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. He also gave money to Michael Lowry of Fine Gael. Mr Justice Brian McCracken, sole member of The McCracken Tribunal which was established by the Irish Government in 1997, found that Dunne knowingly assisted Lowry evade tax. On 22 March 2011, the Moriarty Tribunal concluded of Ben Dunne's dealings with Michael Lowry that "What was contemplated and attempted on the part of Mr Dunne and Mr Lowry was profoundly corrupt to a degree that was nothing short of breathtaking" \u2013 the report referring to its finding Mr Lowry sought to influence a rent review of a building part-owned by Mr Dunne.\u000aHe now owns a chain of fitness centres called Ben Dunne Gyms in located in Dublin and Liverpool, which he personally promotes on radio, using recent Irish advertising legislation which allows direct comparisons to named competitors. Dunne was working on a new health club, to open in Dún Laoghaire in Dublin, but abandoned the project due to complaints from local residents.\u000aIn April 2005 he paid £3,000,000 for a 21-acre (85,000 m2) site in Motspur Park, New Malden (South London), former home of BBC Football Club and other BBC sports facilities, and intends to apply for planning permission to build a leisure and fitness centre. However, he did not do so. Instead, in February 2008, his company Barkisland Developments Limited submitted a planning application to the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Council for change of use of the sports ground to a cemetery. The application to change the former BBC Sports Ground into a cemetery was withdrawn on 3 October 2008. It had become clear that planning permission was likely to be refused. Objections were lodged by many local residents, sports clubs, Sport England and the Mayor of London.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVArmor is a military science fiction novel by John Steakley. It has some superficial similarities with Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers (such as the military use of exoskeletons and insect-like alien enemies) but concentrates more on the psychological effects of violence on human beings rather than on the political aspect of the military, which was the focus of Heinlein's novel.\u000aIt was first published in December 1984.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot summary ==\u000aArmor is the story of humanity's war against an alien race whose foot soldiers are three-meter-tall insects, referred to in the book as "ants". It is also the story of a research colony on the fringes of human territory which is threatened by pirates. The two sub-plots intersect at the end, with each providing answers and insight into events of the other.\u000aThe title refers to the nuclear-powered exoskeletons worn by the soldiers, but also references the emotional armor the protagonists maintain to survive.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The plot on Banshee ===\u000aThe protagonist is Felix, an enlistee who's been given "scout" duty on an alien planet in the seemingly endless Antwar. Little is known of him initially but that he suffers from burnout and refuses to die, even when it seems inevitable. When entering into combat, a persona he calls the "Engine" takes over. The Engine makes him into a ruthless killing machine dedicated to keeping him alive at all costs.\u000aThe novel starts with Felix and his company assaulting an inhospitable planet aptly named "Banshee." Using armored infantry suits, soldiers drop onto the planet from starships via a teleportation device called "Transit." The attack goes horribly wrong, as Felix's company is completely wiped out, and the mountain fort they were originally supposed to capture is revealed to be a giant hive. In the aftermath of his first encounter, Felix regroups with the surviving humans. There, he meets another highly skilled scout named Forest, who participated in the fleet-wide Armored Olympics against decorated soldier Nathan Kent. It is also revealed that the Ants can lock onto the fleet's Transit beacons and barrage them with missiles fired from the Hive, making retreat impossible.\u000aDuring a fallback to an elevated bluff, a dying soldier keys all functions on the suit and blows up the nuclear powered suit. Several warriors are killed in the disaster, including Forest. Before dying she confesses to Felix that she always loved Kent. With no options left the warriors resort to attacking the Hive to secure transport back to the ship. Exploiting the Hive's tunnel system, they plan to use a wounded soldier as a bomb to destroy it. Before the attack, Felix meets a soldier named Bolov who tells him that as a scout on his first drop, Felix has a 10% chance of survival.\u000aFelix and his fellow soldiers are ambushed by ants on their way up the hive. During the attack, the soldier they planned on using as a bomb is killed, rendering him useless. In a stroke of bad luck, Bolov is also mortally wounded, grudgingly accepts the task of sacrificing himself and is thrown in the Hive by Felix. The Hive is then destroyed and the survivors are able to retreat back to the ship.\u000aAfter 19 drops on Banshee, Felix has learned that he is an almost unstoppable warrior. His 20th drop is revealed to be a fleet mission to create humanity's first forward operating base on Banshee. He also learns that Nathan Kent will be dropping with him.\u000aThe soldiers successfully create an impregnable fort on Banshee. Felix learns from his inexperienced Commanding Officer, Canada Shoen, that one of the purposes of the fort is to show non-combat officers and journalists what the war is like. Felix is disgusted by this revelation. After spending time with Nathan Kent, he tells him about Forest's death and her true feelings for him. Kent is devastated and attacks Felix in a drunken rage. The fort withstands several assaults from the ants and wears them down almost to complete exhaustion. During a celebration for their victory, ants attack from underground and kill dozens of people, before ultimately being crushed again.\u000aFelix discovers that his 21st drop will be with the affluent monarch of an extra-solar planet, named the Masao. They drop onto an area not infested with ants so that he can see Banshee for himself. However, in a moment of climax, Felix is revealed to be the runaway monarch of an equally wealthy planet called Golden. After a tragic freighter accident that killed his wife, Felix fled his responsibilities as monarch and joined the fleet to suppress the memories of her. The Masao, who is his best friend, begs for Felix to return to Golden. He agrees to leave the military, but still refuses to return to his home planet. Only moments before being teleported onto the ship, Felix notices a Hive in the distance that barrages them with missiles, killing the Masao.\u000aIn the ensuing chaos on board the ship, Kent grabs Felix and helps him escape from the fleet before ultimately being killed himself by the ship's trigger-happy security.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The plot on Sanction ===\u000aMost of the action of the later two-thirds of the book takes place on Sanction, a planet far removed from the fighting, at a Fleet research facility.\u000aJack Crow is a notorious celebrity and one-time pirate. A morally questionable character with views and opinions that are just as questionable, he is a tough man who does not hesitate to kill. He is constantly at odds with his own morality but he knows the difference between his celebrity reputation and his real personality. At times, his reputation is more of a burden than a blessing.\u000aJack, having been imprisoned, is successful in an escape attempt, permits him to reach the ship of a mutineer and deserter from the Antwar named Borglyn. Jack strikes a deal where, in exchange for Borglyn saving his life, he will infiltrate and sabotage the Fleet research project on Sanction so Borglyn can access its limitless Fleet power source to refuel his ship, and continue on his deserter way. Borglyn will also pay Jack and give him a small scout ship to go his own way.\u000aOn Sanction, Jack takes an old suit of battle armor to project Director Hollis "Holly" Ware, to ingratiate himself and get the necessary access to fulfill his bargain with Borglyn. But Jack is then asked by Holly to participate in an experiment to retrieve the data from the suit's battle recorder, which is the "memory" of the wearer while the suit was active.\u000aOut of curiosity and a bit of false bonhomie, Jack agrees; he, Holly and Lya (a Fleet psychologist and Holly's girlfriend) spend several sessions "immersed" firsthand in the life of Felix on Banshee and on board ship. During these sessions, more of events on Banshee are described, and the reader is introduced for the first time to Felix as he sees himself and experiences battle. A few tidbits of memory also tantalize the researchers (and ourselves) to learn the true identify of Felix.\u000aThrough either the complacency or gross incompetence of his superiors, Felix has suffered unbelievably, yet continues to soldier on. This also challenges the trio to deal with the knowledge that the public story of the Antwar is far different from the true horror. These immersions change Jack - as it does the others - so that he chooses to make an almost certain suicidal stand with Holly against Borglyn's attack on the facility.\u000aThroughout the novel, Jack comes into contact with the alcoholic owner of Sanction, a wealthy rancher named Lewis. Lewis is profoundly anti-war and doesn't allow his citizens to carry energy weapons. Jack comes to despise Lewis for his irresponsible drunken nature. However, he later saves Jack and Holly during Borglyn's attack. Lewis is then revealed to be Felix, who dons the black scout armor once more to fend off the attackers. He destroys Borglyn's forces and attempts to attack his ship. At the last second, Borglyn fires all of the ships weapons, seemingly destroying everything around it.\u000aJack and Holly watch in awe as this happens, and catch a final glimpse of Felix on the back of the starship through a security camera, who appears to be still alive. Felix destroys the camera and is hinted to escape once again. The current rulers of Golden send emissaries to Sanction to search for their legendary protector. The novel ends with Jack, Holly, and Lya starting new lives on Sanction outside of fleet influence.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Developments ==\u000aA sequel was in the works at the time of Steakley's death.

aVBright Orange for the Shroud (1965) is a sixth novel in the Travis McGee series by John D. MacDonald. The plot follows McGee as he attempts to salvage the money of friend Arthur Wilkinson after the man is defrauded in a semi-legal confidence scheme involving a land deal.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000aWhile enjoying another installment of his "retirement," Travis McGee is visited by Arthur Wilkinson, who had briefly been part of McGee's circle before leaving to get married. Wilkinson is in terrible physical condition, and collapses as he reaches McGee's boat. With the help of Chookie, who dated Wilkinson for a time, McGee learns that Wilkinson has been bankrupted by a land development scheme in which the partners kept demanding greater and greater shares until Wilkinson's bank account was empty and he was heavily in debt to his friends. He also endured a savage beating from the gang's muscle, a rustic psychopath named Boone Waxwell, and was twice jailed and disgraced on fraudulent charges arranged by the gang.\u000aAfter spending several weeks nursing Arthur back to health, McGee scouts out the lower-level conspirators and forms a guarded friendship with Vivian Crane, whose husband's law practice has been ruined by rumors of his participation in the scam. McGee also pays a visit to Waxwell at his backwoods home, and barely manages to get away whole after besting Waxwell in a vicious brawl.\u000aMcGee determines that the only money remaining from Wilkinson's inheritance is the remainder of Waxwell's share, which is buried in jars around Waxwell's house. Before he can execute the plan, however, Waxwell gets the drop on him outside Vivian Crane's house and leaves him in the back of his car. McGee manages to crawl to a hiding place, where he overhears Waxwell raping Vivian. Waxwell flees the scene when he discovers McGee is missing. McGee goes into the house and finds Vivian has committed suicide with a pistol after killing her husband, who lay in a drunken stupor during her rape. McGee alters the crime scene to create the impression that Waxwell killed both Vivian and her husband, then phones in an anonymous report to the police.\u000aWaxwell, now the target of a statewide manhunt, flees into the swamps. McGee recovers a substantial amount of money from Waxwell's hiding places. Arthur and Chookie have become lovers, and McGee decides to give them the full amount as a wedding present. Waxwell, by chance, boards the houseboat and holds them at bay with a gun. After a long, tense period in which it becomes clear Waxwell plans to kill them all after getting clear of the dragnet, the three manage to get the gun away from Waxwell, who accidentally impales himself on a cypress stump while jumping clear of the houseboat. The three leave his body to be discovered by searchers.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Themes ==\u000aAs with all of the Travis McGee novels, the title includes a color that is referenced in the narrative. This book's title refers to the orange bathrobe Vivian Crane puts on before killing herself. McGee comments that this color is not appropriate for death because it is so lifelike.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aMerrill, Hugh (2000).

aVThe Ernst Strüngmann Institute for Neuroscience in Cooperation with Max Planck Society (ESI) is an independent research institute financed by Andreas and Thomas Strüngmann, German entrepreneurs, and named after their father Dr. Ernst Strüngmann. The ESI is under the scientific governance of the Max Planck Society. It is located in Frankfurt am Main in Hesse. ESI-directors are Scientific Members of the Max Planck Society. ESI\u2019s mission is to perform excellent fundamental brain research. ESI research focuses on understanding how the many parts of the brain work together to bring about our behaviour.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Development ==\u000aIn July 2008, a cooperation contract was signed between the Max Planck Society and Drs. Andreas and Thomas Strüngmann to found the ESI as an independent brain research institute with the format of a Max Planck Institute and adhering to the Max Planck excellence principles. On 12 September 2008, the ESI was formally founded, with the legal form of a nonprofit limited liability corporation (\u201cgemeinnützige Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (gGmbH)\u201d). To finance the ESI, the Strüngmann brothers founded the Ernst Strüngmann Foundation (ESF). ESI\u2019s founding directors are Wolf Singer and Pascal Fries. Mid July 2009, Prof. Fries became ESI\u2019s first director and thereby ESI\u2019s current managing director. On 1 April 2011, when Prof. Singer assumed emeritus status at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research, he joined the ESI as Senior Research Group leader. On 1 October 2011, Dr. Ilka Diester joined the ESI as Research Group leader. 2012 Dr. Michael Schmid's independent junior research group that investigates the principles of thalamo-cortical communication for visual perception and attention started at the ESI.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Research ==\u000aResearch at the ESI aims at understanding how the human brain brings about adaptive behavior, i.e. behavior that is e.g. influenced by previous experience or that weights sensory evidence by its estimated relevance. The respective theoretical concepts like \u201cmemory\u201d or \u201cselective attention\u201d are addressed as cognitive functions. Cognitive functions are brought about by the complex interactions among many neurons, neuronal groups, and brain areas. These complex interactions cannot yet be deduced from our understanding of individual neurons. Therefore, a central goal is to understand the principles behind such interactions and how they lead to behavior. Research at the ESI aims at understanding the mechanisms behind the core cognitive functions.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aHomepage of the institute\u000aPage of the MPG about the institute

aVMeteg (or metheg, Hebrew \u05de\u05b6\u05ea\u05b6\u05d2, lit. 'bridle', also ga'ya \u05d2\u05e2\u05d9\u05d4, lit. 'bellowing', \u05de\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05da ma'arikh, or \u05de\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05d3 ma'amid) is a punctuation mark used in Biblical Hebrew for stress marking. It is a vertical bar placed under the affected syllable.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Usage ==\u000aMeteg is primarily used in Biblical Hebrew to mark secondary stress and vowel length. Words may contain multiple metegs, e.g. \u05de\u05b9\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d1\u05b9\u05ea\u05b5\u05d9\u05db\u05b6\u05dd, \u05d5\u05bc\u05dc\u05b0\u05d0\u05b6\u05d1\u05b0\u05d9\u05b9\u05e0\u05b0\u05da\u05b8.\u000aMeteg is also sometimes used in Biblical Hebrew to mark a long vowel. While short and long vowels are largely allophonic, they are not always predictable from spelling, e.g. \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5 'and they saw' vs. \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5 'and they feared'. Meteg's indication of length also indirectly indicates that a following shva is vocal, as in the previous case. Note that this may distinguish qamatz gadol and qatan, e.g. \u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05d4 'she guarded' vs. \u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05d4 'guard (volitive)'.\u000aIn modern usage meteg is only used in liturgical contexts and dictionaries. Siddurim and dictionaries may use meteg to mark primary stress, often only for non-final stress, since the majority of Hebrew words have final stress.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Appearance and placement ==\u000aIts form is a vertical bar placed either to the left, the right, or in the middle of the niqqud (diacritics for vowels or cantillation) under a consonant. It is identical in appearance to silluq and is unified with it in Unicode.\u000aMeteg differs from other Hebrew diacritics in that its placement is not totally fixed. While meteg is usually placed to the left of a vowel, some texts place it to the right, and some place it in the middle of hataf vowels. The Rabbinic Bible of 1524\u201325 always shifts meteg to the left, while the Aleppo and Leningrad codices are not consistent in meteg placement.\u000aThe different placements of meteg are subgrouped relatively to its order with surrounding vowel points occurring below letters before or after it and are summarized in the table below. Three types of metegs are generally considered, with the left meteg being the most common case for simple vowels (however there's some rare cases where this group must be subdivided according to the placement of cantillation accents), and the medial meteg occurring only (but most frequently) with (composite) hataf vowels.\u000aNote finally that under narrow letters (such as nun) with vowel points below, or under letters that are also surrounded by multiple vowel points or cantillation accents below them, the meteg may not fit well on any side of the vowel point below the base letter. In that case the meteg may adopt an ambiguous position, below the existing vowel point or above the cantillation accent that normally fits below the base letter. Such ambiguous positioning occurs in old books like the Codex Leningradensis (around year 1006) whose text on paper was extremely compacted with minimal spacing between letters.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Unicode ==\u000aIn Unicode, Meteg and Silluq (when it occurs before punctuation Sof passuk at end of verses) are unified.\u000aUnicode also does not distinguish between the different placements of Meteg. And because Meteg has a distinctive combining class, its encoding order relative to other diacritics is not significant (because of canonical equivalence). Consequently, the Meteg may be freely reordered during Unicode normalization when it appears in sequences with other combining diacritics, without affecting its interpretation or rendering.\u000aWhere the relative placement of Meteg is significant and does not match the standard order of combining classes of Hebrew diacritics (where the Meteg should appear after Hebrew vowel points but before Hebrew cantilation marks in normalized texts), a combining grapheme joiner (CGJ, U+034F) should be added between Meteg and other diacritics before or after it, to fix its rendering placement and intended meaning.\u000aIn the most frequent use of Meteg, it should follow the vowel mark, but the canonical ordering of combining classes swaps them during standard normalizations: the canonical combining class of Meteg is 22, higher than the canonical combining classes 10 to 20 assigned to Hebrew vowel points; it is also higher than the canonical combining class 21 assigned to the combining Dagesh (or Mapiq) consonnant modifier, but this generally causes no problem.\u000aIn the most frequent cases of use in modern Hebrew, the Meteg should only follow a vowel point and cantillation marks are not used; but in Biblical Hebrew it must sometimes be encoded with an additional CGJ after it before a vowel point, so that it remains interpreted first (and rendered to the right) before the niqqud after it (to the left); Meteg must also be preceded by a CGJ if it must appear after (to the left) a cantillation accent (whose combining class is 220 or more).\u000aAdditionally, the special placements of meteg with the three hataf vowels (whose canonical combinal classes are between 11 and 13) requires encoding it after the hataf vowel point, separated by a zero-width joiner control (ZWJ, U+200D) for the medial position (between the two parts of the hataf vowel), or by a zero-width non-joiner control (ZWNJ, U+200C) for the final position (to the left of the hataf vowel); some encoded texts use CGJ instead of ZWNJ for the later case.\u000aThe three controls CGJ, ZWJ and ZWNJ (which have canonical combining class 0) are all blocking the canonical reordering of meteg with vowels points, and only ZWJ is needed for the special placement of meteg (combining class) in the middle of an hataf vowel. But in the cases where the encoding of CGJ is optional but not needed, or for the case where ZWNJ is replaced by CGJ, the presence or absence of this CGJ control creates texts that are not visually distinctive, but they are still not canonically equivalent. This may create difficulties for plain-text search, unless it uses a conforming Unicode collation algorithm (UCA) with the appropriate tailoring for the Hebrew script, where these controls are assigned ignorable weights after the initial normalization.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a[1]\u000aNormalization for Biblical Hebrew

aVPDTV is an abbreviation short for Pure Digital Television. Often seen as part of the filename of TV shows shared through P2P and The Scene FTP systems on the Internet. In this case, PDTV refers not to container, bitrate or dimensions of the video, but the digital nature of the capture source. Non Scene European rippers often use the label DVBRip or DVB-rip to specify a purely digital rip of a Digital Video Broadcast (DVB), however all Scene groups use standardized labeling.\u000aPDTV encompasses a broad array of capture methods and sources, but generally it involves the capture of SD or non-HD digital television broadcasts without any analog-to-digital conversion, instead relying on directly ripping MPEG streams. PDTV sources can be captured by a variety of digital TV tuner cards from a digital feed such as ClearQAM unencrypted cable, Digital Terrestrial Television, Digital Video Broadcast or other satellite sources. Just as with Freeview (DVB-T) in the United Kingdom, broadcast television in the United States has no barriers to PDTV capture. Hardware such as the HDHomeRun when connected to an ATSC (Antenna) or unencrypted ClearQAM cable feed allows lossless digital capture of MPEG-2 streams (Pure Digital Television), without monthly fees or other restrictions normally implemented by a Set-top box. Although different from the analog hole, Pure Digital Television capture imposes no technological restriction on what is done with the stream; playback, Mash-Ups and even recompression/pirated distribution are possible without the permission of the rights holder.\u000aA publisher of fan-made DVD releases also uses the name PDTV, but with no connection to the more common usage explained above. The "PD" in this case refers to "planet dust" with an additional connotation of Public Domain, even though the material offered is more often the video equivalent of abandonware as opposed to anything where copyright has actually expired. Whereas pdtv content online (as described above) is indiscriminate in terms of copyright, physical DVD releases from PDTV only exist to supply fans with material not officially published to the DVD format.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVBikers For Christ, or BFC is a Christian ministry for motorcyclists founded in 1990 by Pastor Fred Zariczny (A.K.A. "Pastor Z"), who pastors Rushing Wind Ministries in Oceanside, California, the associated church under which the organization operates. Bikers for Christ was originally a ministry of Calvary Chapel in Marysville, California. There are currently hundreds of chapters with thousands of members worldwide. Paul Crouch Jr. with the Trinity Broadcasting Network has recognized BFC as one of the largest Christian motorcycle ministries in the world. In a 2010 radio interview with Christian metal radio program The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Zariczny mentions that BFC has Chapters in Belgium, Lithuania and Sweden. BFC sponsors several motorcycle events to raise money for the handicapped, underprivileged and disabled. BFC also sponsors events to honor Vietnam Veterans where a 370-foot (110 m) mini replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall is displayed publicly. Pastor Fred is also known for his Christian tattoos after having the BFC membership patch logo tattooed on his back by Kim Saigh on LA Ink.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial website

aVExposed is the debut solo album of former Mötley Crüe frontman Vince Neil following his exit from Mötley Crüe in 1992. The album was released in 1993 and it reached No. 13 on the US Billboard 200 chart.\u000aThe album was recorded at the Record Plant in 1992. Vince titled the album, "Exposed" because he thought of the album as his moment in the spotlight no longer being a member of Mötley Crüe.\u000aVince's manager, Bruce Bird, died of a brain aneurysm during the recording. Vince later hired Burt Stein.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Background ==\u000aVince Neil, together with then manager Bruce Bird and Jack Blades, originally approached long time friend and ex-Ozzy bassist Phil Soussan to help him write the album and put a band together. Soussan left his then current band Beggars & Thieves and wrote several tracks with Neil of which 5 were included on the album. The original line-up was to have featured Adrian Vandenberg of Whitesnake and Manic Eden on guitar but a switch was made at the last minute, at Warner Bros. recommendation, and Steve Stevens was hired. The former Billy Idol guitarist and Atomic Playboys founder, claims to have subsequently played all bass and guitar tracks on Exposed. During the final recording process, Soussan left the band after differences with Stevens, who had insisted on wanting to play bass on the album. Robbie Crane was then switched from rhythm guitar to bass, Dave Marshall was hired as rhythm guitarist and Vik Foxx continued to play drums. The band's first show was played at the Roxy under the name "Five Guys From Van Nuys". The band eventually went on tour, opening for Van Halen.\u000aIn an interview conducted with Metal Sludge, Robbie Crane said that he left the band after getting into a fight and punching Neil. In that occasion, the band musicians had missed a show due to a broken down bus, and Neil had to perform with members of other bands (Slaughter and Warrant), and the two got into a heated exchange when Crane arrived at the venue. Crane said that he hit a drunken Neil, causing Neil to hit and cut his head open on a spike on the ground. Crane also said that Foxx was fired from the band after stealing equipment.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Content ==\u000aThe album includes Neil's debut solo single "You're Invited (But Your Friend Can't Come)". The song exists in two versions; the first of which was included on the soundtrack to the Les Mayfield movie Encino Man - a music video was released for this version featuring a cameo from Pauly Shore. The track was rerecorded for the album with Billy Idol guitarist Steve Stevens.\u000aAlso included is a cover of "Set Me Free" from the Sweet\u2019s Desolation Boulevard, and the Soussan/Neil ballad "Forever", dedicated to the latter's wife Sharise, who filed for divorce from Neil earlier that year. At the end of the song is a few seconds of silence, followed by a little girl's voice saying "Oh no!" \u2013 this is Vince's late daughter Skylar.\u000aPornstar Janine Lindemulder can be seen in the video for the second single "Sister of Pain". The video for the third single, "Can't Change Me", was filmed at the Record Plant. The video for the fourth single, "Can't Have Your Cake", featured the then up-and-coming Pamela Anderson, and the singer's son Neil Wharton, who portrayed a young Vince Neil in the video.\u000aNeil recorded two bonus tracks for the Japanese edition: "Blondes (Have More Fun)" and the Ramones\u2019 cover "I Wanna Be Sedated".\u000a"The Last Goodbye" , cowritten with Todd Meagher, was pulled from the album at the last minute due to a dispute between Meagher and Neil that culminated in a brawl at the Roxbury on Sunset Strip. The song was a ballad, about Neil's split from Mötley.\u000a"Exposed did well\u2026 and I'm sure the record that Mötley Crüe did without me was also very good," Neil said in 2000, "but my solo record wasn't Mötley Crüe and theirs wasn't either. The magic just wasn't there."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Track listing ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personnel ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Band members ===\u000aVince Neil \u2013 lead and backing vocals\u000aSteve Stevens \u2013 all guitars, bass guitar\u000aVik Foxx \u2013 drums, percussion\u000aDave Marshall \u2013 rhythm guitar (credited, but does not appear)\u000aRobbie Crane \u2013 bass guitar (credited, but does not appear)\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Additional musicians ===\u000aRobbie Buchanan - keyboards\u000aTommy Funderburk, Timothy B.

aVEarthbound is a live album by the band King Crimson, released in 1972 as a budget record shortly after the line-up that recorded it had broken up. It contains the band's first official live release of their signature song "21st Century Schizoid Man", and an extended live version of their 1970 non-LP B-side "Groon". It also contains two improvised tracks with scat vocals from Boz Burrell.\u000aThe album's sound quality is very poor, because of its being recorded onto cassette tape (a low-fidelity recording medium by 1972 standards) by live sound engineer Hunter MacDonald. The liner notes to the original LP cover and recent CD reissues of the album state that it was "captured live on an Ampex stereo cassette fed from a Kelsey Morris custom built mixer ... in the rain from the back of a Volkswagen truck." Atlantic Records, King Crimson's original North American distributor, declined release of Earthbound because of its poor sound engineering. Because of its cassette origins, the sound could not be significantly improved on later CD reissues of the album.\u000aAn expanded CD-DVD version of the album was set for release on 13 November 2017.

aVThe Mergellina Funicular (Italian: Funicolare Mergellina), is a funicular railway line that forms part of the public transport system for the city of Naples, Italy. Opened in 1931, the Mergellina Funicular was the fourth, and most recent, cable railway opened in Naples.\u000aThe Mergellina Funicular connects five stations: Manzoni station, Parco Angelina station, San Gioacchino station, San Antonio station, and Mergellina station. Unlike Naples' other three funicular lines which all reach Vanvitelli, the Mergellina line is located on its own, farther to the northwest, and runs uphill from the marina at Mergellina Sanazzarro to Manzoni, where Line 6 of the Naples Metro can be reached by a short walk.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aMergellina Funicular was the most recently constructed of Naples' four funicular railways. In the early 20th century, urban expansion had begun to see Naples spreading outwards, including towards the northwestern hills, and new residential neighbourhoods were being constructed on Posillipo hill. In order to facilitate easier access into the area, construction was commenced on the Mergellina Funicular in the late 1920s, and it first opened for service on 24 May 1931.\u000aThe line did not experience any of the delays or problems of the other three, and it was up to full operation immediately, continuing to operate without problem through World War II, and for much of the immediate post-war period. It was not until the early 1980s that the line began to experience problems. The age and constant use of the engines and carriages had begun to take their toll, and the Mergellina line soon began to experience regular disruptions to service. Whilst the line was popular, it was not generating enough revenue for the scale of overhaul that was required, and its operators transferred management over to regional authorities.\u000aModernisation work commenced in May 1985, with new electronic and mechanical components, operations and controls, and transmissions and safety systems installed. The work proceeded without any problems, and the overhauled Mergellina Funicular was reopened to the public on 16 January 1986 after just seven months of closure. The line was again briefly closed between May 1989 and March 1990 for an overhaul to the rail and traction systems, in time for Naples to play a role as a host city during the 1990 FIFA World Cup.\u000aIn 1999, the Campania Regional Management Committee transferred management of the Mergellina Funicular to Azienda Napoletana Mobilità (ANM - Neapolitan Mobility Agency), who were by then responsible for running all four funicular lines in Naples. As with the other three lines, ANM was replaced as the operator on 1 February 2001 by Metronapoli, who began a process of better integrating the various elements of rail transport within Naples, creating better interchanges and connections. ANM took over Metronapoli in November 2013, thereby again becoming the Mergellina Funicular's operator.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Operation ==\u000aThe Mergellina Funicular carries a quarter of a million passengers annually, with an average of 3,200 passengers on workdays, and 2,000 on weekends and holidays, making it the least used funicular line in Naples. From the top to bottom the line is 570 metres (1,870 ft) long, and ascends 147 metres (482 ft) in altitude, at an average gradient of 16%, although one section is as steep as 46%. The carriages travel at an average speed of 3.5 metres per second (11.48 ft/s), and the entire route takes seven minutes. Each train can carry 60 passengers at a time, giving a total capacity of 480 passengers per hour in each direction.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Stations ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of Naples metro stations\u000aList of rapid transit systems\u000aList of funicular railways\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial site of the Metropolitana di Naples (in Italian)\u000aUrbanrail.net Naples rail website\u000aRailways and metro station of Naples (in Italian)

aVHundreds of millions of cats are kept as pets around the world. Cats have either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with humans. Cats are also used in the fur trade, as food, and to control pests.\u000aCats and humans evolutionarily diverged from a common ancestor (boreoeutherian ancestor) approximately 80 million years ago, accumulating only 10\u201312 chromosomal translocations. The order of several genes in chromosomes X and Y in cats closely resembles that in humans.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Pet ==\u000a\u000aCats are common pets in all continents of the world (excluding Antarctica), and their global population is difficult to ascertain, with estimates ranging from anywhere between 200 million to 600 million. In 1998 there were around 76 million cats in Europe, 7 million in Japan and 3 million in Australia. A 2007 report stated that about 37 million US households owned cats, with an average of 2.2 cats per household giving a total population of around 82 million; in contrast, there are about 72 million pet dogs in that country. Cats exceeded dogs in number as pets in the United States in 1985 for the first time, in part because the development of kitty litter in the mid-20th century eliminated the unpleasantly powerful smell of cat urine.\u000aAlthough cat ownership has commonly been associated with women, a 2007 Gallup poll reported that men and women in the United States of America were equally likely to own a cat. The ratio of pedigree/purebred cats to random-bred cats varies from country to country. However, generally speaking, purebreds are less than 10% of the total population.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Fur ==\u000aAccording to the Humane Society of the United States, as well as being kept as pets, cats are also used in the international fur trade. Cat fur is used in coats, gloves, hats, shoes, blankets and stuffed toys. About 24 cats are needed to make a cat fur coat. This use has now been outlawed in several countries, including the United States, Australia and the European Union. However, some cat furs are still made into blankets in Switzerland as folk remedies that are believed to help rheumatism.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Meat ==\u000a\u000aIt has long been common for cats to be eaten in some parts of China and in some other Asian countries and it is estimated that in southern China's Guangdong province people eat 10,000 cats per day. Animal People estimates that 4 million cats are killed and consumed in Asia every year. An animal-rights group collected 16,000 signatures in 2014 to outlaw the consumption of cat meat in Switzerland.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Pest control ==\u000a\u000aCats, as with the traditional farm cat and ship's cat, are also used for pest control, particularly in the case of rat or mouse infestation. As such, they are sometimes referred to as a "mouser", and in Britain there is even the official title of 'Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office' (additional duties include "greeting guests to the house, inspecting security defences, and testing antique furniture for napping quality").\u000a\u000a\u000a== Domesticated varieties ==\u000aThe current list of cat breeds is quite large: with the Cat Fanciers' Association recognizing 41 breeds, of which 16 are "natural breeds" that probably emerged before humans began breeding pedigree cats, while the others were developed over the latter half of the 20th century. Because of common crossbreeding, many cats are simply identified as belonging to the homogeneous breeds of domestic longhair and domestic shorthair, depending on their type of fur.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Cat coat patterns and colors ===\u000aThe coloration, pattern, length (short, medium or long), and texture of the coats of cats are determined by genetics.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Body types ===\u000aCats can also come in several body types, ranging between two extremes:\u000aOriental\u000aNot a specific breed, but any cat with an elongated slender build, almond-shaped eyes, long nose, large ears (the Siamese and Oriental Shorthair breeds are examples of this).\u000aForeign\u000aLess slender than the oriental type, but nevertheless a cat with a slight build and generally athletic look. Typical example breeds would be the Abyssinian cat and the Turkish Angora.\u000aSemi-Foreign\u000aMore or less the middle range of body conformation types, this type of cat is less slender without being stocky. Example breeds would be the Devon Rex and the Egyptian Mau.\u000aSemi-Cobby\u000aThese cats look more rounded without looking too stocky. Example breeds would be the American Shorthair and British Shorthair.\u000aCobby\u000aAny cat with a short, muscular, compact build, roundish eyes, short nose, and small ears. Persian cats and Exotic cats are two prime examples of such a body type.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Effects on human health ==\u000a\u000aBecause of their small size, domesticated house cats pose little physical danger to adult humans. However, in the USA cats inflict about 400,000 bites per year. This number represents about one in ten of all animal bites. Many cat bites will become infected, sometimes with serious consequences such as cat-scratch disease, or, more rarely, rabies. Cats may also pose a danger to pregnant women and immunosuppressed individuals, since their feces can transmit toxoplasmosis. A large percentage of cats are infected with this parasite, with infection rates ranging from around 40 to 60% in both domestic and stray cats worldwide. Research indicates a correlation between the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which sexually reproduces exclusively in cats, and numerous human psychiatric conditions, including OCD. The compulsive hoarding of cats, a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), has long been associated with "crazy cat ladies".\u000aAllergic reactions to cat dander and/or cat saliva are common. Some humans who are allergic to cats\u2014typically manifested by hay fever, asthma, or a skin rash\u2014quickly acclimate themselves to a particular animal and live comfortably in the same house with it, while retaining an allergy to cats in general. Whether the risk of developing allergic diseases such as asthma is increased or decreased by cat ownership is uncertain. Some owners cope with this problem by taking allergy medicine, along with bathing their cats frequently, since weekly bathing will reduce the amount of dander shed by a cat. There have also been attempts to breed hypoallergenic cats, which would be less likely to provoke an allergic reaction.\u000aAs well as posing health risks, interactions with cats may improve health and reduce physical responses to stress: for example the presence of cats may moderate increased blood pressure. Cat ownership may also improve psychological health by providing emotional support and dispelling feelings of depression, anxiety and loneliness. Their ability to provide companionship and friendship are common reasons given for owning a cat.\u000aFrom another point of view, cats are thought to be able to improve the general mood of their owners by alleviating negative attitudes. According to a Swiss study carried out in 2003, cats may change the overall psychological state of their owner as their company's effect appears to be comparable to that of a human partner. The researchers concluded that, while cats were not shown to promote positive moods, they do alleviate negative ones.\u000aOne study found that cat ownership is associated with a reduced risk of heart attacks and strokes at the 95% confidence interval.\u000aSeveral studies have shown that cats develop affection towards their owners. However, the effect of these pets on human health is closely related to the time and effort the cat owner is able to invest in it, in terms of bonding and playing.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Indoor scratching ==\u000aA natural behavior in cats is to hook their front claws periodically into suitable surfaces and pull backwards. Cats, like humans, keep their muscles trim and their body flexible by stretching. Additionally, such periodic scratching serves to clean and sharpen their claws. Indoor cats may benefit from being provided with a scratching post so that they are less likely to use carpet or furniture, which they can easily ruin. However, some cats may simply ignore such a device. Commercial scratching posts typically are covered in carpeting or upholstery. Using a plain wooden surface, or reversing the carpeting on the posts so that the rougher texture of the carpet backing, may be a more attractive alternative to the cat than the floor covering. Scratching posts made of sisal rope or corrugated cardboard are also common.\u000a\u000aAlthough scratching can serve cats to keep their claws from growing excessively long, their nails can be trimmed if necessary. Another response to indoor scratching is onychectomy, commonly known as declawing. This is a surgical procedure to remove the claw and first bone of each digit of a cat's paws. Declawing is most commonly only performed on the front feet. A related procedure is tendonectomy, which involves cutting a tendon needed for cats to extend their claws. Declawing is a major surgical procedure and can produce pain, and infections.\u000aSince this surgery is almost always performed for the benefit of owners, it is controversial and remains uncommon outside of North America. In many countries, declawing is prohibited by animal welfare laws and it is ethically controversial within the veterinary community. While both the Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals strongly discourage or condemn the procedure, the American Veterinary Medical Association supports the procedure under certain guidelines and finds "no scientific evidence that declawing leads to behavioral abnormalities when the behavior of declawed cats is compared with that of cats in control groups." They further argue that many cats would be given up and euthanized were declawing not performed.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Waste ==\u000aBeing fastidious self-cleaners, cats detest their own waste and instinctually bury their urine and feces. Indoor cats are usually provided with a box containing litter, generally consisting of bentonite, but sometimes other absorbent material such as shredded paper or wood chips, or sometimes sand or similar material can be used. It should be cleaned daily and changed often, depending on the number of cats in a household and the type of litter; if it is not kept clean, a cat may be fastidious enough to find other locations in the house for urination or defecation. This may also happen for other reasons; for instance, if a cat becomes constipated and defecation is uncomfortable, it may associate the discomfort with the litter box and avoid it in favor of another location.\u000aDaily attention to the litter box also serves as a monitor of the cat's health. Bentonite or clumping litter is a variation which absorbs urine into clumps which can be sifted out along with feces, and thus stays cleaner longer with regular sifting, but has sometimes been reported to cause health problems in some cats.\u000a\u000aSome cats can be trained to use the human toilet, eliminating the litter box and its attendant expense, unpleasant odor, and the need to use landfill space for disposal.\u000aAn exhibit at the San Diego Natural History Museum states that cat feces from urban runoff carry Toxoplasma gondii parasites to the ocean and kill sea otters.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Genetic similarities with humans ==\u000aThe order of eight genes on the cats' Y chromosome closely resembles that in humans. Genes on X chromosomes of cats and humans are arranged in similar way.\u000aDomestic cats are affected by over 250 naturally occurring hereditary disorders, many of which are similar to those in humans, such as diabetes, hemophilia and Tay\u2013Sachs disease. For example, Abyssinian cat's pedigree contains a genetic mutation that causes retinitis pigmentosa, which also affects humans. The domestic cat is also an excellent model for human infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a genetic relative of HIV.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aCat behavior\u000aDomestication of animals\u000aPuppy cat\u000aShip's cat\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Institute of Jugglology is an American performance art juggling team from Fayetteville, Arkansas, consisting of Galen Harp and Ellen Winters. They started performing together in 2005 and specialize in theatrical routines, original tricks, and mixed object juggling. "Winters and Harp founded the Institute of Jugglology, a Fayetteville, Arkansas\u2013based business that encompasses both performing and teaching. The duo is currently the top-ranked American juggling team, and they won the silver medal at this year\u2019s International Jugglers\u2019 Association Team Championships in Winston-Salem, North Carolina." Their work focuses on using object manipulation to create temporary works of art in the form of sand paintings and kinetic sculptures. In 2011 they began work on a four- part series of performances called \u201cCircuit\u201d. "Circuits I-III" debuted at the International Juggling Championships with \u201cCircuit II\u201d placing second. The silver medalists, Galen Harp and Ellen Winters, performing as the Institute of Jugglology since 2005, explore the frontiers of technical eccentricity... Their mixed-object trade-offs and passing seemed to rate highly on the difficulty scale and the audience was always intrigued to see what would happen next. In 2014 their performance of \u201cCircuit IV:Mandala\u201d won the world championship awarded by the International Jugglers' Association.

aVClan Ralston is a Scottish clan. The clan is recognized as such by the Court of the Lord Lyon, but as it does not currently have a chief recognized by the Lord Lyon King of Arms it is considered an Armigerous clan.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Origins of the clan ===\u000aAccording to the Collins Scottish Clan and Family Encyclopedia there are two likely explanations for the surname Ralston that both relate to wolf-like qualities. The origin in the north is probably a diminutive of hroth wolfe which means wolf of fame The origin in the south stems from the personal name Ralph which is a diminutive of the name Randolph which itself comes from the old English raedwlf or cunnning wolf.\u000aIn 1272 Nicolas de Ralston witnessed a charter to the monks of Paisley. In 1296 Hew de Ralston appears rendering homage to Edward I of England in the Ragman Rolls. In 1346 Jacobus de Raulyston witnessed the election of an Abbot of Paisley.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 15th to 18th century ===\u000aIn 1449 John de Ralston who was the Bishop of Dunkeld was appointed as the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland. In the same year he was ambassador to England and again in 1452. During the Anglo-Scottish Wars, Hew de Ralston of Ralston was killed fighting the English at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547.\u000aIn the early 18th-century the Ralston estate passed to the Earl of Dundonald.

aVThe Rockingham County Fair Association is a non-profit organization that manages the Rockingham County Fair; the state of Virginia's biggest agricultural county fair, featuring exhibitions and events devoted to the presentation and promotion of farm life and food production. The fair is held annually, just south of Harrisonburg, Virginia at the Rockingham County Fairgrounds on US Rt. 11. A board of directors is elected by the membership composed of 51 civic and service clubs from Rockingham County and the City of Harrisonburg, Virginia. Volunteers contribute over 13,000 hours of labor each year to ensure the success of the fair.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History of the Fair ==\u000aThe first Rockingham County Fair was held at the Linville Ball Park, August 31 - September 3, 1949. Many, smaller fairs were held before 1949 at Ed's Park at Rawley Springs, and in Harrisonburg on the Whitesel-Sit lot and at the present location of Memorial Stadium. From 1950-1951, the fair was four days long, from 1952\u20131963, five days long, and since 1964, the fair has run for six days.\u000aThe fair has been held at the present site on US Rt. 11 since 1980. The fairgrounds account for 111 acres of land, a 21,000-square-foot (2,000 m2) exhibit hall for display of local creative arts, homemaking skills and commercial exhibits. In addition, the grounds include a barn complex with a capacity of 1,100 head of hogs, sheep, beef cattle, dairy cattle and goats, a building for horticulture, flowers and farm crop displays, the Virginia Poultry Industry Center, a building for poultry/rabbit exhibits, and food booths run by local civic clubs. There is also a grandstand, which seats 4,000 people, plus another 2,500 at ground level. The barn complex is approximately 85,000 square feet (7,900 m2) of space under-roof. There is parking on the grounds for over 7,000 cars.\u000aThe fairgrounds are used throughout the year for a variety of events including; fundraising activities, livestock breed shows, trade shows, exhibitions and community events.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Rockingham County Fair Past Presidents ==\u000a1948-1973 \u2013 Charles Wampler, Jr.\u000a1974-1975 \u2013 Thurston J.

aVHalsafjord or Halsafjorden (English: Halsa Fjord) is a fjord located between Halsa Municipality and Tingvoll Municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. The 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) long fjord branches south off the Vinjefjorden and stretches about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) until it becomes the Trongfjorden off which the Surnadalsfjord later branches.\u000aThe European route E39 highway crosses the fjord by a car ferry from Kanestraum in Tingvoll to Halsanaustan in Halsa. Investigations are made regarding a bridge over the fjord. The length would be around 2-3 kilometres. Since the depth is around 490 meters, an advanced solution with a floating tower in the middle is suggested.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Yamaha 29 was a sailboat manufactured by Yamaha.\u000aOn request from Yamaha, Group Finot in France designed the boat in 1973. The hull is based on the same classical design as the Morbic III who won the Fastnet the same year. The layout is innovative with a center cockpit and the main cabin in the rear.\u000aThe Yamaha team with Mr Horinshi was very impressed with the design, and two prototypes were made in 1975. Even though the boat got good reviews from press and owners, only 55 were built in total. About 5 of those were sold to Norway.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000ahttp://www.finot.com\u000aYamaha 28/29 (1973)(in French)\u000ahttp://www.yamahasailboats.org

aVSTV2 is a local television network in Scotland, operating five city-based TV licences serving Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen and Ayr. It is owned and operated by STV Group plc.\u000aInitially broadcast as two separate stations - STV Glasgow and STV Edinburgh - the launch of three local licences in Aberdeen, Dundee and Ayr led to the launch of a single networked service on 24 April 2017.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Overview ==\u000aIn January 2013, the broadcast regulator Ofcom announced STV had been awarded two licences to broadcast local TV services in the Glasgow and Edinburgh areas for a twelve-year period. The broadcaster pledged to run the channels in partnership with Glasgow Caledonian University and Edinburgh Napier University respectively.\u000aCoinciding with a group-wide revamp, STV Glasgow began broadcasting at 6.30pm on Monday 2 June 2014, with the first edition of its flagship evening magazine programme, The Riverside Show. STV Edinburgh followed at 7pm on Monday 12 January 2015, launching with the first edition of The Fountainbridge Show.\u000aIn March 2015, STV won three further local TV licences for the Aberdeen, Dundee and Ayr areas - under the working titles of Around Aberdeen, View from the Bridges and Ayrshire Today. No other bids were received for the three services.\u000aThe majority of STV2's programming is produced and broadcast from STV's headquarters at Pacific Quay in Glasgow. Unlike the main STV channel, where transmission originates in-house, playout and presentation is provided by Comux, the local TV multiplex operator, at its operations centre in Birmingham.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Programming ==\u000aAs of April 2017, the five local TV services under the STV2 banner carry a single schedule of networked programming.\u000aSTV News airs bespoke half-hour bulletins for STV2 at 1 pm and 10 pm alongside a simulcast of the Edinburgh edition of STV News at Six. The network's flagship news programme, STV News Tonight airs each weeknight at 7 pm and incorporates Scottish, UK and international news. The half-hour programme, presented by Halla Mohieddeen, is produced in partnership with ITN.\u000aNon-news programmes for the channel include the early evening magazine Live at Five, Peter & Roughie's Football Show, Scottish Politics This Week, documentary series The People's History Show and chat shows including My Life in Ten Pictures and The Late Show with Ewen Cameron. Acquired programming includes the Irish soap Fair City and Finnish drama Black Widows.

It is a "one-shot" analogue of quantum relative entropy and shares many properties of the latter quantity.\u000aIn the study of quantum information theory, we typically assume that information processing tasks are repeated multiple times, independently. The corresponding information-theoretic notions are therefore defined in the asymptotic limit. The quintessential entropy measure, von Neumann entropy, is one such notion. In contrast, the study of one-shot quantum information theory is concerned with information processing when a task is conducted only once. New entropic measures emerge in this scenario, as traditional notions cease to give a precise characterization of resource requirements. \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u03f5\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005cepsilon }\u000a  -relative entropy is one such particularly interesting measure.\u000aIn the asymptotic scenario, relative entropy acts as a parent quantity for other measures besides being an important measure itself.

aVRizal Special Education Learning Center, also known as Rizal Sped De La Salle, is a De La Salle-supervised school located in Davao Central.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aIn 1986 three educators thought of opening a school offering courses with their respective specialization: preschool, intellectually challenged, and hearing-Impaired education. The main goal of opening the Rizal Special Education Learning Center is to help educate pupils/students with special needs such as the hearing impaired, intellectually challenged, autistic, slow learners and fast learners. However, the need for regular atmosphere for eventual mainstreaming prompted the founders to open classes for regular pupils, thus, regular classes were opened with two grade levels every school year until Elementary Course was complete.\u000aAfter nine years, it was observed that a lot of the graduate expressed their desires and sentiments to proceed with the secondary level in the same school. On the appeal of the parents, the concept was considered and realized.\u000aThe two levels in secondary Course were opened in 1995-1996. The following year attendance soared, which made it necessary to relocate from Rizal Sped, Davao City to the present site.\u000aOn January 18, 1996, the new building at Pardo de Tavera Street, Davao City, was inaugurated and upon the opening of the school year 1996-1997 all levels started to move classes in three thousand square meter campus.

aVMinuscule 399 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), \u03b594 (von Soden), is a Greek minuscule manuscript of the New Testament, on parchment. Paleographically it has been assigned to the 9th or 10th century.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description ==\u000aThe codex contains text of the four Gospels, on 214 parchment leaves (17.3 cm by 11.6 cm). The text is written in one column per page, in 27 lines per page. It contains lectionary markings at the margin.\u000aThe texts of John 5:3.4 and Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11) are marked by an obelus.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Text ==\u000aThe Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type. Hermann von Soden classified it to the textual family K1. Aland placed it in Category V. According to the Claremont Profile Method it represents textual family Kx in Luke 10 and Luke 20. In Luke 1 it has a mixture of the Byzantine text-families.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe manuscript is dated to the 9th or 10th century. It was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Gregory in 1908.\u000aThe manuscript is currently housed at the National Library of Russia (Gr. 220) in Saint Petersburg.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Scholz's 399 ==\u000aThe codex contains incomplete text of the Gospels: John, Luke, and Matthew, on 220 parchment leaves (29.7 cm by 20.8 cm). The text is written in one column per page, in 22 lines per page. It contains prolegomena, the tables of the \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1 (tables of contents) before each Gospel, numbers of Verses, and a commentary (of John Chrysostom, in Luke of Bostra's).\u000aThe order of Gospels is the same as in codex 90.\u000aIt was examined and described by Giuseppe Passini (as 109). It was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Scholz (1794-1852), who slightly examined it. Fenton Hort saw it in 1864. C. R. Gregory saw it in 1886. In 1908 Gregory removed it from the list of the New Testament manuscript, because it is rather a commentary than text and sometimes without text.\u000aThe manuscript is currently housed at the Turin National University Library (C. II. 14) in Turin.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of New Testament minuscules\u000aBiblical manuscript\u000aTextual criticism\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aGregory, Caspar René (1908).

aVThe Fugio Cent is the first official one-cent piece of United States currency. Consisting of 0.36 oz of copper, its design was inspired by the works of Benjamin Franklin. While very available in lower grades, rare examples in excellent condition are highly sought by collectors.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aOn April 21, 1787, the Congress of the Confederation of the United States authorized a design for an official copper penny, later referred to as the Fugio cent because of its image of the sun shining down on a sundial with the caption, "Fugio" (Latin: I flee/fly). This coin was reportedly designed by Benjamin Franklin; as a reminder to its holders, he put at its bottom the message, "Mind Your Business." The image and the words form a rebus meaning that "time flies, do your work." This design was also used on the "Continental dollar" (issued as coins of unknown real denomination, and in paper notes of different fractional denominations) in February 1776.\u000aSome historians believe that the word "business" was intended literally here, as Franklin was an influential and successful businessman. Given Franklin's history publishing aphorisms, it may have been intended to mean both monetary and social business.\u000aThe reverse side of both the 1776 coins and paper notes, and the 1787 coins, bore the third motto "We Are One" (in English) surrounded by thirteen chain links, representing the original thirteen colonial states.\u000aFollowing the reform of the central government with the 1789 ratification of the 1787 Constitution, gold and silver coins transitioned to the motto "E pluribus unum" from the Great Seal of the United States.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aBank of New York Hoard\u000aLarge cent (United States coin)\u000aHistory of the United States dollar\u000aUnited States dollar\u000aUnited States Note\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aThe Fugio Cent of 1787: Introduction, The Coins of Colonial and Earlier America.\u000aU.S. Mint: Circulating Coins FAQ\u000aU.S. Mint: 1776 Continental "Dollar"

aVInterleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) is a cytokine receptor which binds interleukin 1. Two forms of the receptor exist. The type I receptor is primarily responsible for transmitting the inflammatory effects of interleukin-1 (IL-1) while type II receptors may act as a suppressor of IL-1 activity by competing for IL-1 binding. Also opposing the effects of IL-1 is the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA).\u000aThe IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) is a transmembrane protein that interacts with IL-1R and is required for IL-1 signal transduction.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aReceptors, Interleukin-1 at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)

aVTheodore Livingston (born March 5, 1963), better known as Grand Wizzard Theodore, is an American hip hop DJ. He is widely credited as the inventor of the scratching technique. In addition to scratching, he achieved renown for his mastery of needle drops and other techniques which he invented or perfected.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aBorn in Bronx, New York, Theodore's brother, Mean Gene, was his mentor, and began to teach him the technique of DJing during his childhood years. Theodore also apprenticed under Grandmaster Flash.\u000aThough variants of the story exist, it is generally accepted that Grand Wizzard Theodore was playing records at a high volume in his bedroom. Fed up with the noise his mother entered and ordered him to turn the music down. At this point he looked away from the turntable to face her. While his mother lectured him he continued slowly moving the record back and forth, which produced a sound all its own. When she left the room he was intrigued by the sound the vinyl made when manipulated in this fashion. After months of experimentation he introduced this technique at a party and thus scratching was born. Many forms of popular music have since used the technique.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aIn the early 1980s, Theodore was a part of the group Grandwizard Theodore & the Fantastic Five. They released "Can I Get a Soul Clap" in 1982. He was also featured in the 1983 film Wild Style, as well as contributing to the film's soundtrack. He explains the origin of the scratch in the documentary, Scratch.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Legacy ==\u000aTheodore's phrase "Say turn it up" from his track "Fantastic Freaks at the Dixie" was sampled by hip hop and rap acts such as Public Enemy (on the track "Bring the Noise"), Bomb the Bass (on the track "Megablast") and many others.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000ahiphop.sh/theo\u000a"Grand Wizard Theodore on Peter Rosenberg's "Juan Epstein" podcast".

aVThe Free National Movement (abbreviated FNM) is a conservative political party in The Bahamas formed in the 1970s, led by Cecil Wallace Whitfield. The current leader of the party is Hubert Minnis and his deputy is Peter Turnquest. It dominated the General Election held on 10 May 2017, winning 35 of the 39 seats in the Legislature.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe FNM was established at Jimmy Shepherd\u2019s house on Spring Hills Farms in Fox Hill in 1971. The Free-PLP were a breakaway group of eight MPs from the then governing Progressive Liberal Party. This group, which was known as the "Dissident Eight", included Cecil Wallace Whitfield, Arthur Foulkes, Warren J. Levarity, Maurice Moore, Dr. Curtis McMillan , James (Jimmy) Shepherd, Elwood Donaldson and George Thompson. Following meetings held at Spring Hill Farms, the FNM officially became a political party in October 1971, with Cecil Wallace Whitfield as its leader.\u000aThe other group, the UBP, was one of the main political parties in the Bahamas and had governed the country since the advent of party politics in 1958, until it lost the 1967 general election by a paper thin margin to the Opposition PLP.\u000aThe UBP party's leadership was predominantly white while blacks made up most of the citizenry. Once out of power, its leaders decided that the party's time was at an end and they looked to the Free-PLP to form a new party that would follow a conservative party line. The fusion was called the Free National Movement.\u000aThe party grew in part by uniting independent black voters and the old UBP voter base. However, these were heady days for the governing PLP, who led the country to independence in 1973, and the FNM failed to gain much more than 40% of the vote in a string of general elections defeats.\u000aIn 1990, Hubert Ingraham took over the leadership of the party after the death of Sir Cecil Wallace Whitfield. The FNM attacked the governing PLP on corruption charges and published a Manifesto.\u000aIn the General Election of 1992, the FNM defeated its rival, the PLP, by wide margins, winning 32 of the then 49 seats. The FNM Government privatized the government-owned hotels, which had fallen into decline since nationalization. Private radio stations were allowed to operate, ending the government's broadcast monopoly. The FNM also introduced local government and encouraged inward investment to grow the economy. The elections of 1997 saw the FNM re-elected in a landslide, with 35 of the 40 seats in a reduced House.\u000aAfter Ingraham vowed not to seek a third term in office, Tommy Turnquest was elected leader of the party. The party then lost the 2002 elections. Many voters, including FNM supporters, felt that Turnquest was much "weaker" than Perry Christie, leader of the Progressive Liberal Party.\u000aAt the FNM's party convention the following the general elections of 2002, Ingraham was returned as leader of the Free National Movement. The FNM went on to regain control of the House of Assembly in the elections of 2007.\u000aThe FNM lost government to the Progressive Liberal Party once again in the 2012 Bahamian General Elections; it dropped its total share of votes (obtaining only 42.1 percent of the vote, compared to 48.7 percent by the Progressive Liberal Party). The Progressives won 29 of the seats in the legislature and thus the government, compared to the FNM's 9. Ingraham subsequently resigned, both as party leader as well as the Member of Parliament for North Abaco, and announced his retirement from politics following the defeat. He had served in Parliament for 35 years, winning re-election seven times, including 2012. Ingraham told supporters, "I gave it the best I could and now I've been rejected by the public of the Bahamas... We had no indication from the general public they would go that way."  Following this series of events the FNM went on to lose the by-election triggered by Ingraham´s retirement held on 15 October 2012, reducing the total FNM seat count to 8 of the 38 seats in the House of Assembly. The FNM however went on to win the 2017 general election under the leadership of Hubert Minnis, gaining 35 seats out of 39 total.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Electoral results ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial website

Along with other well preserved insect fossils, the A. antoinei specimen was collected from layers of Late Oligocene lacustrine rock belonging to the "calcaire de Campagne Calavon" sediments. The material is exposed along the northern slopes of the Luberon mountains near Céreste in southern France. The sediments are reported as from a shallow paleolake that was formerly considered about 30 million year old and Rupelian in age. Recent restudy of formation has suggested the older Late Oligocene age. The paleoflora preserved in the shales suggest the lake was surrounded by a mixed-mesophytic forest, though the vertebrate fauna found in the formation is more typical of a semi-arid environment. Specimens from the Apoidea families are rather rare and not diverse, with Apis specimens being the most common.\u000aAt the time of study, the holotype counterpart and part were part of the paleoentomology collections housed by the Museum National d\u2019Histoire Naturelle. It was first studied by an international team of researchers headed by Manuel Dehon of the University of Mons, Belgium, with the team's 2014 type description of the species was published in the natural sciences journal PLOS One. The specific epithet antoinei is a patronym coined in honor of Antoine Michez, for the support he provided melittology.\u000aA morphometric analysis of the wings indicates placement into the bee family Andrenidae, though specific features of the family, such as two sulci under the antenna and pointed glossa in the mouth parts are not visible in the fossil. The size and shape of the wing cells places the species into the subfamily Andreninae and excludes placement into any of the other subfamilies. Given a lack of any features that would indicate placement into a different genus, the species was placed into Andrena until further specimens are recovered.\u000aA. antoinei is one of four bee species described by Dehon and team in the PLOS One article, the others being Bombus cerdanyensis, Euglossopteryx biesmeijeri, and Protohabropoda pauli.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description ==\u000aThe A. antoinei fossil is a male preserved with a dorsal view of the body, head tilted upward showing the face, the antennae are laid out sideways from the head and the wings are similarly splayed out from the body. The head is 2.56 mm (0.101 in), the mesosoma is 2.9 mm (0.11 in), and the preserved section of the metasoma is 4.47 mm (0.176 in) long though only the basal two segments are preserved. The head and body coloration is a mix of black, yellow and brown tones. Brown tones are preserved on the wing veins, antennae and metasoma. Black tones are present on the mesosoma, tip segments of the metasoma, and most of the head. The head shows a distinct yellow tone on the clypeus. The antennae are not completely preserved for determining flagellomere numbers, the right having seven and the left having six. The 5.94 mm (0.234 in) long hyaline forewings have a one marginal cell and three cells below that called the submarginal cells. The marginal cell has a distinct tapering in width from the base to the apical end, which is distinctly rounded. The second and third submarginal cells together are slightly shorter than the first submarginal cell, which is the longest of the three cells. The pterostigma is present, with a darkened tone, and it more than three times longer than its maximum width.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a Media related to Andrena antoinei at Wikimedia Commons\u000a Data related to Andrena antoinei at Wikispecies

aVRural New Yorker was a weekly periodical founded in 1850 that was published by the Rural Publishing Co., New York City. The magazine continued through the middle of the 20th century.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aDaniel D.T. Moore founded the publication as Moore's Rural New Yorker in Rochester, New York in 1850. Moore later became mayor of Rochester in 1865. After moving the paper to New York City (it opened a branch office at the old New York Times building at 41 Park Row by 1869), financial setbacks caused him to give up the paper in the 1870s.\u000aAfter moving to New York City, the paper eventually had offices at 34 Park Row, the Scott & Bowne Building at Chambers and Pearl Streets (409 Pearl), and around 1911 it moved to the old Chelsea Methodist Church on West Thirtieth Street, where it remained for many years.\u000aJohn J. Dillon was editor and publisher of the paper for over 58 years, from about 1892 until his death in 1950.\u000aA quilt pattern column was published under the name of "Mrs. R.E. Smith" from 1930 to 1937.\u000aStarting in 1890 it ran the motto "A Square Deal" to reflect the fact that it guaranteed that subscribers would not be treated unfairly by its advertisers, taking great efforts to make them whole.\u000aAs of 1956, the publication still had 300,000 subscribers. It was acquired by American Agriculturist and merged in 1964, which is now published by Farm Progress.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aMoore's Rural New-Yorker, Volume V, 1854, archive.org\u000aMoore's Rural New-Yorker, Volume X, 1859, archive.org\u000aMoore's Rural New-Yorker, 1861-1865, via libraryweb.org\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 38, 1879, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 40, 1881, via Google books\u000aRural New-Yorker, Vol. XLVI, March 19, 1887 - June 18, 1887, via archive.org\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 47, 1888, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 50, 1891, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 51, 1892, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 52, 1893, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 53, 1894, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 54, 1895, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 55, 1896, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 56, 1897, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 57, 1898, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 58, 1899, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 60, 1901, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 61, 1902, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 62, 1903, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 63, 1904, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 64, 1905, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 65, 1906, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 66, 1907, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 67, 1908, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 68, 1909, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 69, 1910, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 70, 1911, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 71, 1912, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 72, 1913, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 75, 1916, via Google books\u000aThe Rural New-Yorker, Volume 77, 1918, via Google books\u000a"Rural New-Yorker" search for issues, at archive.org

aVNK Slaven Belupo, often referred to simply as Slaven and known internationally as NK Slaven Koprivnica, is a Croatian football club based in the city of Koprivnica in the north of the country. They play their home matches at Gradski stadion in Koprivnica.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe first football club in Koprivnica was founded in June 1907, when a student team was formed and named \u0110a\u010dki nogometni klub, which is Croatian for Students' Football Club. The name Slaven first appeared when a sports club named H\u0160K Slaven was founded by the members of the Friedrich family on 20 August 1912 and this is considered to be the foundation date of the present-day club. The club won the Croatian regional championship in 1920. Slaven was subsequently renamed H\u0160K Victorija, but disbanded six years later due to financial difficulties. Subsequently, the city of Koprivnica was without a football club for four years, between 1926 and 1930.\u000aBetween 1930 and 1945, the club was known as H\u0160K Koprivnica, H\u0160K Danica and RNH\u0160K Sloga, before the name Slaven returned with the foundation of FD Slaven. From 1953, the club was known as SD Podravka, before being renamed to NK Slaven in 1958. The name Slaven remains until today, with occasional changes to the name of the club's principal sponsors. The club was thus known as NK Slaven Bilokalnik between 1992 and 1994, after which it was changed to its current name following a sponsorship agreement with the Koprivnica-based pharmaceutical company Belupo.\u000aSlaven gained their first promotion to the Prva HNL in 1997 and have never been relegated. In 2000, they finished fifth in the Prva HNL and qualified for the UEFA Intertoto Cup. In their first Intertoto Cup appearance, they managed to reach the third round of the competition before being eliminated by Czech club Sigma Olomouc after losing 2\u20130 at home and getting a goalless draw on the road. One year later, they repeated the success and were eliminated by renowned English club Aston Villa with a 3\u20132 aggregate defeat. In their next two Intertoto Cup appearances, they were even more successful as they reached the semifinals of the competition on both occasions. They were eliminated after losing to renowned clubs Stuttgart from Germany and Lille from France, respectively. Their last Intertoto Cup appearance in 2005 ended in the third round with a 4\u20130 aggregate defeat to Spanish club Deportivo La Coruña, having lost the first leg by 1\u20130 and the second leg by 0\u20133.\u000aIn 2007, the club reached the Croatian Cup final for the first time, after defeating defending Cup holders HNK Rijeka 3\u20132 on aggregate. In the final, they lost to Dinamo Zagreb 2\u20131 on aggregate. Despite having lost the final, Slaven qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time in their history, since Dinamo had already qualified for the UEFA Champions League by virtue of having won the Prva HNL.\u000aSlaven reached the second qualifying round of the 2007\u201308 UEFA Cup, defeating Albanian side Teuta Durrës 8\u20134 on aggregate before being eliminated after a 4\u20132 aggregate defeat to Turkish club Galatasaray. In 2008, Slaven finished runners-up in the Croatian league, which remains their best domestic result to date.\u000aOn 28 August 2008 Slaven Belupo qualified for the 2008\u201309 UEFA Cup by beating Aris of Greece 2\u20131 on aggregate, thereby achieving arguably the best result in the history of the club.\u000aSlaven finished 3rd in the 2011\u201312 1. HNL, qualifying for the 2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League. After defeating Portadown 10\u20132 on aggregate they bowed out to Spanish giants Athletic Bilbao 4\u20133 on aggregate.\u000aIn 2016, Slaven defeated HNK Rijeka 4\u20132 on aggregate in the 2015\u201316 Croatian Football Cup semi-final, reaching the final for the second time in their history.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Current squad ==\u000aAs of 15 February 2018 \u000aNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

aVThese Arms Are Snakes was an American post-hardcore band that formed in 2002 and featured former members of Botch and Kill Sadie. Before disbanding in 2009, they released three studio albums: Oxeneers or the Lion Sleeps When Its Antelope Go Home (2004), Easter (2006) and Tail Swallower and Dove (2008). Former members of These Arms Are Snakes currently play in Russian Circles, Narrows, Minus the Bear, Crypts, and Hooves.\u000aThey toured with the bands Minus the Bear, Big Business, Mastodon, Cursive, The Blood Brothers, Engine Down, Hot Water Music, Isis, Pelican, Chiodos, and Against Me!.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Formation (2002\u20132003) ===\u000aThe band formed as a five-piece in 2002 with Steve Snere of Kill Sadie, Brian Cook of Botch, and Ryan Frederiksen of Nineironspitfire in addition to Joe Preston and Jesse Robertson. They chose the name "These Arms Are Snakes" as their band name because it was "ridiculous and [didn't] really sound like any other band name that's out there." The group announced that they had signed to Jade Tree Records in March 2003, and released their debut EP This Is Meant to Hurt You on August 19, 2003. This was the only release with a full-time keyboardist, as Jesse Robertson left the band in 2004 after having differences in opinion about the group's touring style. AllMusic rated the debut EP three stars out of five and called the lyrics "smart [and] cunning."\u000aThey continued as a four-piece band from this point forward. Before recording their follow-up album to This Is Meant to Hurt You, Joe Preston also left the group and was replaced by Erin Tate who played in Kill Sadie with Steve Snere and Minus the Bear. Preston and other members of These Arms Are Snakes got into a van accident with a semi-truck following his farewell show.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Oxeneers (2004\u20132005) ===\u000aBrian Cook would still occasionally perform keys throughout the remainder of the group's existence. According to Ryan Frederiksen, this move opened up more space on stage allowing them to "run free across the whole stage," allowing for a more intense live show. The loss of Robertson also allowed These Arms Are Snakes to focus on their overall sound and create "stripped-down, spacious arrangements." These changes impacted their debut full-length Oxeneers or the Lion Sleeps When Its Antelope Go Home (often referred to more simply as either The Lion Sleeps or Oxeneers) released though Jade Tree in September 2004.\u000aIn support of Oxeneers, These Arms Are Snakes joined the "Totally Badical Tour" with headliner Underoath and openers The Chariot, Hopesfall, and Fear Before the March of Flames. The band was not warmly received on this tour. Audience members bought merchandise, though according to the group this felt more like an "empty gesture." Band members also experienced friction between themselves and some of the other bands on the tour. Underoath is composed of Christian band members that would openly express their thoughts on religion and politics and would frequently conflict with the ideals of These Arms Are Snakes.\u000a\u000aThese Arms Are Snakes followed up their debut album with Like a Virgin, a split EP with Seattle group Harkonen through Hydra Head Records. The EP featured two new tracks from both bands, and one track written and performed by both groups. This would be the second and final release with drummer Erin Tate, who was replaced by Ben Verellen in 2005 before going on tour with Minus the Bear. One of the tracks included is "Touched for the Very First Time" in collaboration with the band Harkonen.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Easter (2006\u20132007) ===\u000aVerellen quit the band without an explanation given in 2005, and was quickly replaced by drummer and producer Chris Common. Ben Verellen would later go on to form his own amplifier company called Verellen Amplifiers. The group's previous conflicts with Underoath would loosely inspire their second studio album, Easter, released through Jade Tree in 2006. While These Arms Are Snakes weren't trying to make a public statement about organized religion, themes about religion (most notably on "Perpetual Bris") were present. A more prominent lyrical theme throughout Easter was vocalist Steve Snere trying to examine the "bigger picture" of life and existence.\u000aAt the end of 2006, they toured in support of their new album with Thrice, Planes Mistaken for Stars, Mouth of the Architect and Young Widows. In early 2007, These Arms Are Snakes did a small headlining tour in Europe with various bands, and returned to America to open for Against Me! and Mastodon.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Tail Swallower and Dove (2008\u20132009) ===\u000aFor their third studio album, These Arms Are Snakes signed to Suicide Squeeze Records\u2014a label that far better supported the band than their previous record label, Jade Tree. Over their former label, they praised Suicide Squeeze's treatment of the band and ability to market and sell records, in addition to being with more familiar groups like Minus the Bear. Tail Swallower and Dove was released in October 2008. It was again produced by Chris Common and was only recorded in one month\u2014the shortest recording period of an album for the group. The album was seen as a departure from their more hardcore-sounding songs and took a more experimental approach, and also more traditional song structures.\u000aDuring this period, These Arms Are Snakes also released a number of split releases. They released Pelican / These Arms Are Snakes, a split release with Pelican through Hydra Head. A limited edition 12-inch split with Cook's side project Russian Circles was released on tour, and a split with Tropics, Meet Your Mayor / Future Gets Tense was also made in limited quantities. The band's final release before disbanding was a split single with All the Saints, which was originally released as a limited edition 7-inch vinyl through Touch and Go Records, but later released as a digital download. Their contributed track "Washburn" was recorded during the Tail Swallower and Dove sessions.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Break up (2009\u20132010) ===\u000aOn December 25, 2009 These Arms Are Snakes announced that they had broken up. Though the announcement was made in 2010, the band had been inactive since late 2009 with most of the members focusing on their respective side projects and other groups. Guitarist Ryan Frederiksen formed Narrows with former Botch vocalist Dave Verellen and released their debut album New Distances in May 2009. Bassist Brian Cook continued work in Russian Circles and released their third album Geneva in October 2009. Prior to disbanding, These Arms Are Snakes expressed interest in taking their music in a new direction for a potential fourth studio album. Writing and recording was expected to begin in December 2009.\u000aAlso in 2009, the group announced they had recorded tracks for a split with Minus the Bear and a compilation covers album paying tribute to Nirvana's In Utero\u2014both of which were unreleased at the time of the band's break up. After seven years of "extended delays and legal wrangling," Robotic Empire will release In Utero, in Tribute, in Entirety on Record Store Day 2014, which will feature These Arms Are Snakes' cover of Nirvana's "Heart-Shaped Box." The split EP with Minus the Bear failed to materialize, so the band decided to use the track intended for that release \u2014 a cover of Lost Sounds' song "Energy Drink and the Long Walk Home" \u2014 for a split release with The Coathangers instead, which was released in December 2014.

aVKim Sun-il (September 13, 1970 \u2013 c. June 22, 2004) was a South Korean interpreter and Christian missionary who was kidnapped and murdered in Iraq.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life and education ==\u000aKim was fluent in Arabic, holding a graduate degree in that language from Seoul's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in February 2003. He also had degrees in English and theology, and had hoped to become a missionary in the Middle East.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Kidnapping ==\u000aKim arrived in Iraq on June 15, 2003, working for Gana General Trading Company, a South Korean company under contract to the American military. On May 30, 2004, he was kidnapped in Fallujah \u2014 about 50 km (31 mi) west of Baghdad \u2014 by the Islamist group Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad and held as a hostage. The group, which was allegedly led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, killed him on or about June 22 when South Korea refused to meet their demands that it cancel its plans to send 3,000 more troops to Iraq and withdraw the 660 military medics and engineers already there. (This would put South Korea behind only the United Kingdom in number of non-U.S. coalition troops in Iraq.)\u000aJama'at al-Tawhid wa'l Jihad had initially set a June 21 deadline in a videotape showing Kim pleading for his life. However, on June 22, after initial reports that the militants had given their hostage more time, Al Jazeera television reported that they had received a videotape footage of Kim being decapitated by five men, like hostages Nick Berg and Eugene Armstrong in Iraq, Paul Johnson in Saudi Arabia, and Daniel Pearl in Pakistan. The report was subsequently confirmed by the South Korean government. In the murder video, Kim is fitted with an orange jumpsuit and blindfolded, one of the captors reads a statement and then another captor takes out a knife and decapitates him. The statement said: "Korean citizens, you were warned, your hands were the ones who killed him. Enough lies, enough cheatings. Your soldiers are here not for the sake of Iraqis, but for cursed America".\u000aThe president of Gana General Trading is said to have known about the kidnapping almost immediately, but he did not report it until after the videotape aired. He had consulted a lawyer, who argued that the situation must be managed without government intervention if Kim was to be saved. It is claimed that government officials had little time to react. However, there are also reports that a videotape of Kim in captivity, in which he appears calm and openly criticizes U.S. intervention in Iraq, was delivered to the Associated Press Television News offices in Baghdad at the beginning of June, and that on June 3, an AP reporter in Seoul contacted the South Korean foreign ministry asking if they knew of a missing person with a name similar to Kim Sun-il.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reaction ==\u000aSouth Korean President Roh Moo-hyun's National Security Council issued a statement condemning the killing. South Korea's Ministry of Information and Communication has banned the Kim Sun-il murder video and is trying to prevent it from being spread. The unedited video was available on the website Ogrish.com during the summer of 2004. The website received DDoS attacks as a result of hosting the footage.\u000aU.S. President George W. Bush condemned the killers, saying: "The free world cannot be intimidated by the brutal actions of these barbaric people."\u000aReports and editorials in South Korea's press reflected despair at the death of the hostage Kim Sun-il in Iraq, but also defiance towards the kidnappers. South Korean TV stations interrupted their schedules when Mr Kim's body was discovered and subsequently broadcast special rolling news programmes. "Kim Sun-il killed - body identified" was the headline in the independent daily Donga Ilbo. "Kim Sun-il ends up dead" was how the popular daily JoongAng Ilbo reported it. In South Korea, thousands of people rallied against the South Korean military going to Iraq, and to express anger about Kim's death, they burned portraits of the mastermind of his killing, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The South Korean government eventually passed a law barring passport issuance for 1\u20133 years to South Koreans who "damage national prestige"; the law was interpreted as an attempt to curtail Christian missionaries, especially after the 2007 South Korean hostage crisis in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000a2007 South Korean hostage crisis in Afghanistan\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVElizabeth Marie "Betty" Tall Chief (Osage family name: Ki He Kah Stah Tsa; January 24, 1925 \u2013 April 11, 2013) was an American ballerina. She was considered America's first major prima ballerina, and was the first Native American to hold the rank.\u000aAlmost from birth, Tall Chief was involved in dance, starting formal lessons at age three. When she was eight, her family relocated from her birth home of Fairfax, Oklahoma, to Los Angeles, California, to advance the careers of her and her younger sister, Marjorie. At age 17, she moved to New York City in search of a spot with a major ballet company, and, at the urging of her superiors, took the name Maria Tallchief. She spent the next five years with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, where she met legendary choreographer George Balanchine. When Balanchine co-founded what would become the New York City Ballet in 1946, Tallchief became the company's first star.\u000aThe combination of Balanchine's difficult choreography and Tallchief's passionate dancing revolutionized the ballet. Her 1949 role in The Firebird catapulted Tallchief to the top of the ballet world, establishing her as a prima ballerina. Her role as the Sugarplum Fairy in The Nutcracker transformed the ballet from obscure to America's most popular. She traveled the world, becoming the first American to perform in Moscow's Bolshoi Theater. She made regular appearances on American TV before she retired in 1966. After retiring from dance, Tallchief was active in promoting ballet in Chicago. She served as director of ballet for the Lyric Opera of Chicago for most of the 1970s, and debuted the Chicago City Ballet in 1981.\u000aTallchief was honored by the people of Oklahoma with multiple statues and an honorific day. She was inducted in the National Women's Hall of Fame and received a National Medal of Arts. In 1996, Tallchief received a Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime achievements. Her life has been the subject of multiple documentaries and biographies.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aTall Chief, known as "Betty Marie" " to friends and family, was born in Fairfax, Oklahoma, on January 24, 1925, to Alexander Joseph Tall Chief (1890\u20131959), a member of the Osage Nation, and his wife, Ruth (née Porter), of Scottish-Irish descent. Porter had met Tall Chief, a widower, while visiting her sister, who was his mother's housekeeper at the time.\u000aElizabeth Tall Chief's paternal great-grandfather, Peter Bigheart, had helped negotiate for the Osages concerning oil revenues that enriched the Osage Nation. Her father grew up rich as a result, never working "a day in his life." In her autobiography, Tall Chief explained "As a young girl growing up on the Osage reservation in Fairfax, Oklahoma, I felt my father owned the town. He had property everywhere. The local movie theater on Main Street, and the pool hall opposite, belonged to him. Our 10-room, terracotta-brick house stood high on a hill overlooking the reservation." The family spent summers in Colorado Springs to escape the Oklahoma heat. Life was far from perfect, though, as her father was a binge drinker and her parents often fought about money.\u000aTall Chief had five siblings, three from her father's first marriage to a German immigrant: Alexander; Frances (1913\u20131999); and Thomas (1919\u20131981), who played football for the University of Oklahoma, and was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers; Gerald (1922\u20131999), who was injured in childhood when kicked in the head by a horse and never regained normal cognitive function. Her sister Marjorie, an accomplished ballerina in her own right, was Ruth's second child and Betty Marie's "best friend".\u000a\u000aAs a child, Ruth Porter had dreamed about becoming a performer, but her family could not afford dance or music lessons. She was determined that her daughters would not suffer the same fate. Betty Marie was enrolled in summer ballet classes in Colorado Springs at age 3. She and other family members performed at rodeos and other local events. Tall Chief studied piano and contemplated becoming a concert pianist. In 1930, a ballet teacher from Tulsa, Mrs. Sabin, visited Fairfax looking for students and took on Betty Marie and Marjorie as students. Looking back on Sabin many years later, Tall Chief wrote "She was a wretched instructor who never taught the basics, and it's a miracle I wasn't permanently harmed." In addition to the problems in her teaching technique, Sabin had put Tallchief on pointe shortly after she joined the school (at 5 years old) while she was far too young to be able to dance on pointe without injury.\u000aAt age five, Tall Chief was enrolled at the nearby Sacred Heart Catholic School. Impressed by her reading ability, the teachers allowed her to skip the first two grade levels. Between piano, ballet, and school work, Tall Chief had little free time, but loved the outdoors. In her autobiography, she reminisced about time spent "wandering around our big front yard" and "[rambling] around the grounds of our summer cottage hunting for arrowheads in the grass."\u000aIn 1933, the family moved to Los Angeles with the intent of getting the children into Hollywood musicals. The day they arrived in Los Angeles her mother asked the clerk at a local drugstore if he knew any good dance teachers. The clerk recommended Ernest Belcher, father of dancer Marge Champion. "An anonymous man in an unfamiliar town decided our fate with those few words", Tall Chief later recalled. California moved Tall Chief back to the proper grade for her age, but put her in an Opportunity Class for advanced learners. "Opportunity Class or not, I was still way ahead", she recalled. "With nothing to do, I often wandered around the school yard by myself." At this time Tallchief was removed from pointe, probably saving her major injury.\u000aBored with school, Tall Chief devoted herself to dance in Belcher's studio. In addition to ballet, which she had previously been doing all wrong and went back to square one, she learned tap, Spanish dancing, and acrobatics there. She found tumbling very difficult, and eventually quit the class, but later in life put the skills to good use. The family moved to Beverly Hills where schools offered better academics. At Beverly Vista School, Tall Chief experienced what she described as "painful" discrimination and took to spelling her last name as one word, Tallchief. She continued to study piano, appearing as a guest soloist with small symphony orchestras throughout high school.\u000aAt age 12, Tallchief began to work with Bronislava Nijinska, a renowned choreographer who had recently opened her own studio in Los Angeles, and David Lichine, a choreographer and former dancer. Nijinska "was a personification of what ballet was all about", Tallchief recalled. "I looked at her, and I knew this was what I wanted to do." Nijinska imparted a strong sense of discipline and the belief that being a ballerina was a full-time task. "We didn't concentrate only for an hour and a half a day", Tallchief recalled. "We lived it". It was under Nijinska that Tallchief decided ballet was what she wanted to devote her life to. "Before Nijinska, I liked ballet but believed that I was destined to become a concert pianist", she recalled. "Now my goal was different." Nijinska saw Tallchief was serious and began devoting great attention to her.\u000aWhen Tallchief was 15, Nijinska decided to stage three ballets in the Hollywood Bowl. Tallchief expected a lead role, but instead was put in the corps de ballet. She was devastated: "I was hurt and humiliated. I couldn't understand what was happening ... Didn't she love me anymore?" After a pep talk from her mother, Tallchief rededicated herself and soon worked her way into a lead part in Chopin Concerto. When the big day came, she slipped during rehearsal and was concerned, but Nijinksa dismissed it saying "happens to everybody." Tallchief also received instruction from various distinguished teachers during their visits to Los Angeles. For Ada Broadbent, she danced her first pas de deux. Mia Slavenska took a shine to Tallchief and arranged for her to audition for Serge Denham, director of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. He was impressed, but nothing came of it.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Early career ===\u000aTallchief graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1942. She had given up piano and wanted to go to college, but her father was against it. "I've paid for your lessons all your life", he said. "Now it's time for you to find a job." She won a bit part in Presenting Lily Mars, an MGM musical with Judy Garland. Dancing in the movie was "not gratifying" and Tallchief decided against making a career of it. That summer, family friend Tatiana Riabouchinska asked if Tallchief would like to go to New York. With Riabouchinska chaperoning, she set off for the big city at age 17.\u000aOnce in New York, Tallchief looked up Serge Denham. A secretary told her that the company did not need any more dancers and she left crying. A few days later, she was told there was a place for her after all. Denham did not actually remember her, but she had something he needed \u2013 a passport. Many of his dancers were Russian émigrés who lacked passports and the troupe had a Canadian tour coming up. Based on a combination of her talent and her passport, Tallchief was taken on as an apprentice. Her first performance was in Gaîté Parisienne. After the Canadian tour, one of the dancers left the troupe due to pregnancy and Tallchief was offered the woman's place and a $40 per week salary.\u000a\u000aOn her first day as a full member of the company, Tallchief was surprised to find Nijinska had come to town to stage Chopin Concerto with Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. She soon cast Tallchief as first ballerina Nathalie Krassovska's understudy for the lead role. At the Ballet Russe, the Russian ballerinas frequently feuded with American ballerinas, whom they reportedly viewed as inferior. When Tallchief was surprisingly promoted by Nijinska, she became the primary target of their animosity.\u000aAt the same time, the company was preparing to stage Agnes de Mille's Rodeo, or The Courting at Burnt Ranch, an early example of balletic Americana. One day, de Mille suggested that Tallchief change her name. It was a sensitive subject for Tallchief\u2013Dunham had previously suggested Tallchief change her surname to a Russian-sounding name such as Tallchieva, a practice common among ballet dancers at the time. She refused: "Tallchief was my name, and I was proud of it." However, de Mille had a more acceptable idea \u2013 using a modified version of her middle name. Tallchief agreed and was known as Maria Tallchief for the remainder of her career.\u000aWithin her first two months at Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Tallchief had appeared in seven different ballets as part of the corps de ballet. While in New York, she took classes at the School of American Ballet, but on tour there were no official classes. Instead, Tallchief studied the efforts of her more experienced colleagues. In particular, she admired Alexandra Danilova who was known for her work ethic and professionalism. Tallchief practiced whenever she could, earning a reputation as a hard worker. "I was always doing a barre," she wrote, "always giving it my all in rehearsals."\u000aKrassovska feuded with management regularly, raising the possibility of a sudden promotion for Tallchief. She nearly quit the company late in 1942 and Tallchief was told she would go on in her place. Krassovska was persuaded to return, but the incident made it clear to Tallchief she needed to be ready to perform Krassovska's technically difficult role on short notice \u2013 something for which she was not yet ready. In the spring of 1943, Krassovska argued with Denham and left the company. "Unprepared, I was numb with terror," Tallchief recalled. When the company returned to New York, Tallchief received positive reviews. The New York Times dance critic John Martin wrote "Tallchief gave a stunning account of herself in Nijinkska's Chopin Concerto ... She has an easy brilliance that smacks of authority rather than bravura", and predicted she would be a big star in the near future. Glory, however, was short lived as Tallchief returned to the corps when the staging of Chopin Concerto was complete.\u000aBack on tour, Tallchief saw her parents in Los Angeles. Seeing Tallchief's frail appearance \u2013 she had lost a lot of weight from a combination of poor nutrition and stress \u2013 and her minor role in The Snow Maiden, her mother attempted to persuade Tallchief to quit ballet and return to piano. Ruth Tallchief changed her mind when Lichine showed her Martin's column and explained that he was America's top dance critic. Tallchief's second year with Ballet Russe brought bigger roles. She was a soloist in Le Beau Danube and got the lead in Ancient Russia, another Nijinska ballet.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Balanchine era ===\u000aIn the spring of 1944, well known choreographer George Balanchine was hired by Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo to work on a new production called Song of Norway. The move would mark a turning point in Tallchief's and Balanchine's careers. She was drawn to Balanchine from the start. Describing one of her first experiences with him, she wrote "When I saw what he had done, I was astonished. Everything seemed so simple yet perfect: An elegant ballet fell into place before my eyes." At first, she was not sure if he was paying much attention to her, but she quickly found out he was. Balanchine assigned Tallchief a solo in Song of Norway and on the night before the premiere also informed her that she would be Danilova's understudy. The ballet was a success and Balanchine was offered a contract for the rest of the season. He was glad to get back into ballet after years on Broadway and in Hollywood and accepted the offer. Sensing Tallchief's star was on the rise, her mother demanded a raise for her daughter. Tallchief was "mortified" by the move, but Denham gave into the demands and increased her salary to $50 per week and promoted her to "soloist."\u000aBalanchine continued to cast Tallchief in important roles. In Danses Concertantes, she was part of a jazzy pas de trois created for Mary Ellen Moylan, Nicholas Magallanes, and herself. The steps were classical in form, but they were presented in a unique manner. "The accent was sharp, the rhythm swinging and modern", she wrote. "Performing the steps seemed more like an exercise for pleasure and enjoyment than work. It was magical." In Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, she had a pas de deux with Yurek Lazowsky.\u000aShortly before Ballet Imperial was to open, Balanchine informed Tallchief that she would be second lead behind Moylan. "I nearly fainted", she recalled. "I couldn't get over it. As the season wore on, Balanchine grew fond of her both professionally \u2013 The Washington Post called Tallchief his "crucial artistic inspiration" \u2013 and personally. Tallchief was ignorant of the personal attraction for a long time and their relationship remained mostly on a professional level. Slowly they became friends; then one day, Balanchine asked Tallchief to marry him, much to her surprise. After some thought, she agreed and the couple wed on August 16, 1946.\u000aOne night on tour in 1945, Tallchief was doing her barre when Balanchine remarked "if only you would learn to do battement tendu properly you wouldn't have to learn anything else." It was his way of saying she needed to start all over \u2013 battement tendu is the most basic ballet exercise there is. "I wanted to die", she recalled. "But I had seen the difference between Mary Ellen's [who was a pupil of Balanchine] dancing and mine. I knew he was right." Under the tutelage of Balanchine, Tallchief lost ten pounds and elongated her legs and neck. She learned how to hold her chest high, keep her back straight, and keep her feet arched. "My body seemed to be going through a metamorphosis", she recalled. Tallchief relearned the basic exercises the way Balanchine wanted and transformed her greatest weakness\u2013turnout\u2013into a strength. Danilova devoted a lot of her time to instructing Tallchief in the ballerina's art, helping her transform from a teenage girl into a young woman.\u000aTallchief rose to the rank of "featured soloist" as Balanchine continued to cast her in important roles. She created (was the first person to perform) the role of Coquette in Night Shadow, the ballet's most technically challenging role, after Danilova selected the other female lead for herself.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== New York City Ballet ====\u000aAlso in 1946, Balanchine joined with arts patron Lincoln Kirstein to establish the Ballet Society, a direct forerunner to the New York City Ballet. Tallchief had six months remaining on her contract with Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, so stayed with the company until 1947. When her contract expired, she joined Balanchine who was in France as guest choreographer at the Paris Opera Ballet. He has been called upon to "save" the famous troupe, but not everyone appreciated his presence. A group of supporters of Serge Lifar, who was on leave while accusations of aiding the Nazis during World War II were investigated, led a vocal campaign to get rid of Balanchine. Spectateur and Les Arts joined in, publishing articles attacking Balanchine personally. He ignored the company's hierarchy, further angering some dancers.\u000aWhen Tallchief arrived, she was put to work immediately with roles in Le baiser de la fée and Apollo. Another dancer pulled out of Apollo shortly before opening night, forcing Tallchief to learn more difficult role on short notice. In spite of all the difficulties, opening night was a huge success. The French press was fascinated by Tallchief's dancing, and even more so her background. "Peau Rouge danse a l'Opera pour le Roi de Suede" [Redskin dances at the Opera for the King of Sweden], read a front page headline. "La Fille du grand chef Indien danse a l'Opera" [The daughter of the great Indian chief dances at the Opera], read another. Her colleagues never appreciated Tallchief's presence, but French audiences loved her. After six months in Paris, Tallchief and Balanchine returned to New York. During her time in Paris, Tallchief became the first American to perform with the Paris Opera Ballet.\u000aWhen the couple returned to the states, Tallchief quickly became one of the first stars, and first prima ballerina, of the New York City Ballet, which opened in October 1948. Balanchine "revolutionized ballet" by creating roles that demanded athleticism, speed, and aggressive dancing like nothing before. Tallchief was well suited for Balanchine's vision. "I always thought Balanchine was more of a musician even than a choreographer, and perhaps that\u2019s why he and I connected," Tallchief recalled. He created many roles specifically for Tallchief, including the lead of "The Firebird" in 1949. Of her "Firebird" debut, Kirstein wrote "Maria Tallchief made an electrifying appearance, emerging as the nearest approximation to a prima ballerina that we had yet enjoyed." The role created a sensation and launched her to the top of the ballet world, granting her the prima ballerina title. Noting the great technical difficulty of the role, The New York Times critic John Martin wrote that Tallchief was asked "to do everything except spin on her head, and she does it with complete and incomparable brilliance."\u000a\u000aTallchief's popularity help grow the fledgeling dance company and she was asked to perform as many as eight times a week. In 1954, Tallchief was given the role of Sugar Plum Fairy in Balanchine's newly reworked version of The Nutcracker, then an obscure ballet. Her performance of the role helped transform the work into an annual Christmas classic, and the industry's most reliable box-office draw. Critic Walter Terry remarked "Maria Tallchief, as the Sugar Plum Fairy, is herself a creature of magic, dancing the seemingly impossible with effortless beauty of movement, electrifying us with her brilliance, enchanting us with her radiance of being. Does she have any equals anywhere, inside or outside of fairyland? While watching her in The Nutcracker, one is tempted to doubt it."\u000aOther notable roles Tall Chief created under Balanchine include the Swan Queen in Balanchine's version of Swan Lake and Eurydice in Orpheus. She created the lead role of "Prodigal Son", "Jones Beach", "A La Francaix", and plotless works such as "Sylvia Pas de Deux," "Allegro Brillante," "Pas de Dix," and "Symphony in C." Her fiery, athletic performances helped establish Balanchine as the era's most prominent and influential choreographer.\u000aTallchief remained with the New York City Ballet until February 1960, but also took time off to work with other companies. She made guest appearances with the Chicago Opera Ballet, the San Francisco Ballet, the Royal Danish Ballet, and the Hamburg Ballet, among others. Working for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1954-55, she was paid $2,000 a week, reportedly the highest salary ever paid to a dancer at the time. In 1958, she created the lead in Balanchine's Gounod Symphony before taking a leave of absence to have her first child.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Later career ===\u000aAfter leaving the New York City Ballet, Tallchief joined American Ballet Theatre, first as a guest dancer then as prima ballerina. That summer, she appeared alongside Danish danseur Erik Bruhn in Russia, where she was recognized for "aplomb, brilliance, and dignity of the American style." In so doing, she became the first American dancer to perform at Moscow's famed Bolshoi Theater. From 1960 to 1962, Tallchief expanded her repertoire taking on dramatic, as opposed to abstract, roles such as the title roles of Birgit Cullberg\u2019s Miss Julie and Lady from the Sea, as well as the melancholy heroine of Antony Tudor\u2019s Jardin aux Lilas.\u000aTallchief's dancing was not confined to the stage. She appeared on multiple TV shows, including The Ed Sullivan Show. She portrayed Anna Pavlova in the 1952 movie musical Million Dollar Mermaid. In 1962, Tallchief was Rudolf Nureyev's partner of choice for his American debut which was broadcast on national television. Her final performance in America was on television's "Bell Telephone Hour" in 1966.\u000aOn the urging of Balanchine, she relocated to Germany, briefly becoming the lead dancer of the Hamburg Ballet. A 1966 title role in Peter van Dyk\u2019s Cinderella was among her last before she retired from dancing. Feeling alone and missing her new husband, she retired, not wishing to dance beyond her prime. During her career, she danced throughout Europe and South American, in Japan, and in Russia. She made guest appearances with several symphony orchestras.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Teaching and administration ===\u000aAfter retiring from dancing, Tallchief moved to Chicago, where husband Buzz Paschen resided. She served as director of ballet for the Lyric Opera of Chicago from 1973 to 1979. In 1974, she founded Lyric Opera's ballet school, where she taught the Balanchine technique. Explaining her teaching philosophy she wrote "New ideas are essential, but we must retain respect for the art of ballet\u2013and that means the artist too\u2013or else it is no longer an art form."\u000aWith her sister Marjorie, Tallchief founded the Chicago City Ballet in 1981. She served as co-artistic director until its demise in 1987. Despite the company failing, the Chicago Tribune called her "a force in the history of Chicago dance" and said she arguably increased the popularity of dance in the city.\u000aTallchief was featured in the documentary film, Dancing for Mr. B in 1989. From 1990 until her death she was artistic adviser to Von Heidecke's Chicago Festival Ballet.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Dance style ==\u000a\u000aTallchief was known for "dazzling audiences with her speed, energy and fire." She was said to exhibit both "electrifying passion" and great technical ability. She combined precise footwork with athleticism. Ashley Wheater, artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, remarked "When you watch Tallchief on video, you see that aside from the technical polish there is a burning passion she brought to her dancing. In her interpretation of Balanchine\u2019s "Firebird," she was consumed both inside and out. She was not just a great dancer, but a real artist\u2014a true interpreter who brought her personality to bear on the dancing." According to Time, she was also "a master in the perfect pause, the moment of stillness allowing the audience and the narrative to keep pace with the choreography."\u000aWilliam Mason, director emeritus of the Lyric Opera of Chicago, described Tallchief as "a consummate professional ... She realized who and what she was, but she didn't flaunt it. She was unpretentious." Fellow dancer Allegra Kent remarked "She didn\u2019t seem to be frightened of the stage, like some of the others. She had in iron will inside ... She phrased her curls and extensions as delicately or as strongly as the music itself."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aDuring her first year at the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo Tallchief dated Alexander "Sasha" Goudevitch, the darling of the company. "For both of us it was our first love", Tallchief recalled. "We saw each other every day and I was convinced it was true love." Goudevitch moonlighted for extra money, and bought Tallchief an engagement ring. However, in the spring of 1944 he had a sudden change of heart when another girl began to pursue him. "My heart was broken," she recalled.\u000aAfter George Balanchine was hired by the Ballet Russe, he was attracted to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: "It never occurred to me that there was anything more than dancing on his mind ... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat in silence for a moment before saying, "Maria, I would like you to become my wife". "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. She eventually replied, "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.\u000aWhen she told her parents about the engagement, her mother was furious: "I've never heard of anything more ... idiotic [...] What's wrong with you?" Balanchine was unshaken by her objection, saying that she would come around eventually. While they were engaged, Balanchine made extravagant romantic gestures and treated Tallchief with great affection. "He was obviously trying to convince me [that our marriage] was inevitable", she wrote. "I didn't need convincing. I was falling in love."\u000aTallchief and Balanchine were married on August 16, 1946, when she was 21 years old and he was 42. Her parents continued to oppose the marriage, and did not attend the ceremony. The couple did not have a traditional honeymoon: "For both of us, work was more important".\u000aAccording to Tallchief, "Passion and romance didn\u2019t play a big part in our married life. We saved our emotions for the classroom." However, she described Balanchine as "a warm, affectionate, loving husband." Their marriage was annulled in 1952, when both parties were attracted to other people.\u000aIn 1952 Tallchief married Elmourza Natirboff, a pilot for a private charter airline. The couple divorced two years later. In 1955, she met Chicago businessman Henry D. ("Buzz") Paschen Jr. "He was very happy, outgoing, and knew nothing about ballet \u2014 very refreshing," she recalled. The couple married the following June, and honeymooned with a ballet tour of Europe. With Paschen Tallchief had her only child, Elise Maria Paschen (born 1959), who became an award-winning poet and executive director of the Poetry Society of America. With this marriage Tallchief also had a stepdaughter, Margaret Wright. The couple remained together, through Paschen's brief imprisonment for tax evasion, until his 2004 death.\u000aTallchief was direct when she expressed her opinion, not mincing words. "It gave her the illusion of being a diva," said Tallchief protégé Kenneth von Heidecke, "but it was really a keen sense of honesty."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Death and legacy ==\u000aIn December 2012, Tallchief broke her hip. She died on April 11, 2013, from complications stemming from the injury.\u000aTallchief was considered America's first major prima ballerina, and was the first Native American to hold the rank. She remained closely tied to her Osage history until her death, speaking out against stereotypes and misconceptions about Native Americans on many occasions. Tallchief was involved with America for Indian Opportunity and was a director of the Indian Council Fire Achievement Award. She and her sister Marjorie are counted as two of a group of five Native American ballet dancers from Oklahoma born in the 1920s. However, she wished to be judged on the merits of her dance alone. "Above all, I wanted to be appreciated as a prima ballerina who happened to be a Native American, never as someone who was an American Indian ballerina," she wrote.\u000a\u000aTallchief was called "one of the most brilliant American ballerinas of the 20th century" by The New York Times. According to Wheater, she "paved the way for dancers who were not in the traditional mold of ballet ... she was crucial in breaking the stigma." Upon Tallchief's death, Jacques d'Amboise remarked "When you thought of Russian ballet, it was Ulanova. With English ballet, it was Fonteyn. For American ballet, it was Tallchief. She was grand in the grandest way." Time remarked "of all the ballerinas of the last century, few achieved Maria Tallchief\u2019s artistry, a kind of conscious dreaming, a reverie with backbone."\u000aShe is credited with "[breaking] down ethnic barriers" and was among the first Americans to flourish in a field long dominated by Russians and Europeans. Reflecting on her own career, Tallchief wrote "I was in the middle of magic, in the presence of genius. And thank God I knew it."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Honors ===\u000aIn Oklahoma, Tallchief was honored by the governor for both her ballet achievements and her pride in her American Indian heritage. The Legislature declared June 29, 1953, as "Maria Tallchief Day." She is among four Indian ballerinas depicted in "Flight of Spirit", a mural in the Oklahoma Capitol building. Tallchief is a subject of one of the life-size bronze statues titled The Five Moons, located at the Tulsa Historical Society. Osage Nation honored her with the title "Princess Wa-Xthe-Thomba" ("Woman of Two Worlds").\u000a\u000aIn 1996, Tallchief received a Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime achievements. Her Kennedy Center biography states that Tallchief was "both the inspiration and the living expression of the best [the United States] has given the world. Her individualism and her genius came together to create one of the most vital and beautiful chapters in the history of American dance."\u000aTallchief is an inductee of the National Women\u2019s Hall of Fame, and was twice named "Woman of the Year" by the Washington Press Club. She twice was on Dance Magazine's annual award list. The magazine explained the 1960 recognition: "[Tallchief is a] star with a truly American flavor, whose qualities of elegance, brilliance, and modesty ... [made] a distinguished contribution to the recent cultural mission of American Ballet Theatre in Europe and Russia." In 1999, Tallchief was awarded the American National Medal of Arts by the National Endowment of the Arts; in 2011, she received the Chicago History Museum's Making History Award for Distinction in the Performing Arts.\u000aIn 2006, the Metropolitan Museum of Art presented a special tribute to Maria Tallchief titled "A Tribute to Ballet Great Maria Tallchief", during which Tallchief officially named Kenneth von Heidecke as her protégé.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Biographies and documentaries ===\u000aTallchief has been the subject of multiple biographies. Her autobiography, Maria Tallchief: America's Prima Ballerina, was co-written with Larry Kaplan and released in 1997.\u000aSandy and Yasu Osawa of Upstream Productions in Seattle, Washington made a documentary titled Maria Tallchief in November 2007, that aired on PBS between 2007 and 2010.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aFive Moons\u000aWomen in dance\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aBrittan, Shawnee; Champlin, Joanna; Bingham, Drake (2000).

aVTrophonius  (Greek: \u03a4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, Troph\u014dnios) was a Greek hero or daimon or god\u2014it was never certain which one\u2014with a rich mythological tradition and an oracular cult at Lebadaea in Boeotia.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Etymology and parallel cults ==\u000aThe name is etymologically derived from \u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c6\u03c9 trepho, "to nourish". Strabo and several inscriptions refer to him as Zeus Trephonios. Several other chthonic Zeuses are known from the Greek world, including Zeus \u039c\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03af\u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 Meilikhios ("honeyed" or "kindly" Zeus), and Zeus \u03a7\u03b8\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 Chthonios ("Zeus beneath-the-earth"), which were other names for Hades.\u000aSimilar constructions are also found in the Roman world: for example, a shrine at Lavinium in Lazio was dedicated to Aeneas under the title Iuppiter Indiges (Jupiter in-the-earth).\u000a\u000a\u000a== In myth ==\u000a\u000aIn Greek mythology, Trophonius was a son of Erginus. According to the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, he built Apollo's temple at the oracle at Delphi with his brother, Agamedes. Once finished, the oracle told the brothers to do whatsoever they wished for six days and, on the seventh, their greatest wish would be granted. They did and were found dead on the seventh day. The maxim by Menander, "those whom the gods love die young", comes from this story.\u000aAlternatively, according to Pausanias they built a treasure chamber (with a secret entrance only they knew about) for King Hyrieus of Boeotia. Using the secret entrance, they stole Hyrieus' fortune. He was aware but did not know who the thief was; he laid a snare. Agamedes was trapped in it; Trophonius cut off his head so that Hyrieus would not know whose body it was. He then fled into the cavern at Lebadaea, and disappeared forever.\u000aThe cave of Trophonius was not discovered again until the Lebadaeans suffered a plague, and consulted the Delphic Oracle. The Pythia advised them that an unnamed hero was angry at being neglected, and that they should find his grave and offer him worship forthwith. Several unsuccessful searches followed, and the plague continued unabated until a shepherd boy followed a trail of bees into a hole in the ground. Instead of honey, he found a daimon, and Lebadaea lost its plague while gaining a popular oracle.\u000aThe childless Xuthus in Euripides's Ion consults Trophonius on his way to Delphi.\u000aApollonius of Tyana, a legendary wise man and seer of Late Antiquity, once visited the shrine and found that, when it came to philosophy, Trophonius was a proponent of sound Pythagorean doctrines.\u000aPlutarch's De Genio Socratis relates an elaborate dream-vision concerning the cosmos and the afterlife that was supposedly received at Trophonius' oracle.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cult ==\u000aPausanias, in his account of Boeotia (9.39), relates many details about the cult of Trophonius. Whoever desired to consult the oracle would live in a designated house for a period of days, bathing in the river Herkyna and living on sacrificial meat. He would then sacrifice, by day, to a series of gods, including Cronus, Apollo, Zeus the king, Hera the Charioteer, and Demeter-Europa. At night, he would cast a black victim into a pit sacred to Agamedes, drink from two rivers called Lethe and Mnemosyne, and then descend into a cave. Here, most consultees were frightened out of their wits, and forgot the experience entirely upon coming up.\u000aAfterward, the consultee would be seated upon a chair of Mnemosyne, where the priests of the shrine would record his ravings and compose an oracle out of them.\u000a\u000a\u000a== In the classical tradition ==\u000a"To descend into the cave of Trophonios" became a proverbial way of saying "to suffer a great fright". This saying is alluded to in Aristophanes' Clouds.\u000aSeveral ancient philosophers, including Heraclides Ponticus, wrote commentaries on the cult of Trophonios that are now sadly lost. Trophonios has been of interest to classical scholars because the rivers of Lethe and Mnemosyne have close parallels with the Myth of Er at the end of Plato's Republic, with a series of Orphic funerary inscriptions on gold leaves, and with several passages about Memory and forgetting in Hesiod's Theogony. The Hellfire Club once constructed a "Cave of Trophonius" with obscene wall-paintings in which to conduct their revels. The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche calls himself a "Trophonios" in the preface to his Daybreak, alluding to his labor in the underground of moral prejudices.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aTheoi Project - Trophonios\u000aBlack-and-white photo essay of the Oracle of Trophonius at Lebadaea

Following the divorce of her parents at the age of 5, María moved to Mexico City with her mother.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early career ==\u000aHer mother's sister, Yolanda Ortiz, introduced little Angélica to the Mexican Cinema when Gregorio Wallerstein, a movie producer, was looking for a boy for his next movie. Angélica told the producer, "Give me a haircut and I'm that boy". Charmed by the girl, he let her into his audition. She got the role in the movie Pecado ("Sin"). Soon afterwards, she worked on, Una Mujer Decente ("A Decent Woman"), La Hija de la Otra ("The Daughter of the Mistress"), Los Amantes ("The Lovers"), Fierecilla (Little Beast), Sígueme, Corazón ("Follow Me, Sweetheart"). She obtained the Ariel award for her role in Mi Esposa y la Otra ("My Wife and the Mistress") when she was 6. She also performed in her first fotonovela Rayito del Sol ("Little Sunray"). She sang in her two next movies, 2 Caras Tiene el Destino ("Destiny Has Two Faces") and Los Gavilanes (The Hawks) with superstar Pedro Infante, who told her she would be a great actress, because she spoke with her eyes, as he did.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Teen idol ==\u000aIn 1955, Rita Macedo offered her a role in the play La mala semilla (The Bad Seed), which would be the first of a series of plays she was involved with while she filmed. When she was 16 she joined the telenovela industry with the production Cartas de amor (Love Letters). The following year, she acted in musicals as well as in "lucha libre" movies such as El Señor Tormenta (Lord Storm) and Muerte en el ring (Death in the Ring). At that time she was beginning to be referred to as La novia de la juventud (Youth's girlfriend) and after her first musical, a journalist, Octavio de Alba, named her La Novia de México (Mexico's girlfriend or Mexico's sweetheart), which is the title she would keep thereafter.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Singing career ==\u000aAfter a few musicals, she asked for her mother's assistance (who was also her manager) and together with Armando Manzanero, then a new songwriter, she sang 1962's Eddy Eddy which would eventually become one of her greatest musical successes. Manzanero took Angélica to see a producer, and in the same year she released her first album on the Musart record label. The album was a success, so she began touring and making movies with teen idols such as César Costa and actor/singer Enrique Guzmán whom she would date later. After joining RCA, she would later become one of the biggest stars in Latin America. In 1973 she met the aspiring singer Juan Gabriel who would become one of the biggest selling artists in the world. Together, they would record ballads performed by mariachi bands. The single Tú sigues siendo el mismo ("You are still the same") sold one million copies in the United States alone, and has since then been performed by dozens of other singers. She recorded three more albums in 1974. In 1980, she recorded for the first time in a U. K. studio, making an album of ballads and a single record with two pop songs in English, seeking some kind of crossover. During these years, she signed with Marsal Productions, then Caytronics, Melody, RCA again, and finally CBS, which was her last contract with a foreign record company. Since then, she established her own recording company with which she has produced 7 albums.\u000aHer singing career spans through 2013, being her most recent album "With Your Love", produced by R. Levaron, and launched by Universal Music.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Acting career ==\u000aIn 1965, she filmed "Fray Torero" (Friar Bullfighter) in Spain and came back to Mexico to work in two movies, and to record her sixth album. Then, she acted in such successful films as 5 de chocolate y 1 de fresa (Five of chocolate and one of strawberry) and obtained the starring role in the 1968 film version of Corazón salvaje a movie that made her famous in places as far as China. In 1971, she acted in Ernesto Alonso's telenovela Muchacha italiana viene a casarse ("Italian girl comes to get married") which opened the Spanish television market in the United States, and was a success in Central America and South America. She also filmed one of her biggest telenovelas Ana del aire ("Ana of the air", playing a flight attendant role). In 1977, she made the telenovela version of her film Corazón salvaje, released two albums, and performed in the play Papacito Piernas Largas ("Daddy Long-legs"), a play that would spun off an album, and broke the record of more than 1000 performances sold out in the next 3 years.\u000aIn 1986, she starred in Herencia Maldita ("Cursed inheritance") singing the theme-song and releasing an album called "El Hombre de Mi Vida". She later acted with her daughter in a production by Angélica Ortíz titled Una Estrella.
