aVThe issue of school speech or curricular speech as it relates to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution has been the center of controversy and litigation since the mid-20th century. The First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech applies to students in the public schools. In the landmark decision Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, the U.S. Supreme Court formally recognized that students do not "shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate".\u000aThe core principles of Tinker remain unaltered, but are tempered by several important decisions, including Bethel School District v. Fraser, Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier, and Morse v. Frederick. Despite respect for the legitimate educational interests of school officials, the Supreme Court has not abandoned Tinker; it continues to recognize the basis precept of Tinker that viewpoint-specific speech restrictions are an egregious violation of the First Amendment. In Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, the Supreme Court declared: "Discrimination against speech because of its message is presumed to be unconstitutional". Rosenberger held that denial of funds to a student organization on the sole basis that the funds were used to publish a religiously oriented student newspaper was an unconstitutional violation of the right of free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. Accordingly, for other on-campus speech that is neither obscene, vulgar, lewd, indecent, or plainly offensive under Fraser nor school-sponsored under Hazelwood nor advocating illegal drugs at a school-sponsored event under Frederick, Tinker applies limiting the authority of schools to regulate the speech, whether on or off-campus, unless it would materially and substantially disrupt classwork and discipline in the school.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Tinker v. Des Moines ==\u000a\u000aIn Tinker, several students were suspended for wearing black armbands that protested against the Vietnam War.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bethel School District v. Fraser ==\u000a\u000aIn Fraser, a high school student was disciplined following his speech to a school assembly at which he nominated a fellow student for a student elective office. The speech contained sexual innuendos, but not obscenities. The Supreme Court found that school officials could discipline the student. In doing so, it recognized that "the process of educating our youth for citizenship in public schools is not confined to books, the curriculum, and the civics class; schools must teach by example the shared values of a civilized social order". Recognizing that one of the important purposes of public education is to inculcate the habits and manners of civility as valued conducive both to happiness and to the practice of self-government, the Supreme Court emphasized that "consciously or otherwise, teachers\u2014and indeed the older students\u2014demonstrate the appropriate form of civil discourse and political expression by their conduct and deportment in and out of class". Under the Fraser standard, school officials look not merely to the reasonable risk of disruption\u2014the Tinker standard\u2014but would also balance the freedom of a student's speech rights against the school's interest in teaching students the boundaries of socially appropriate behavior. Schools have discretion to curtail not only obscene speech, but speech that is vulgar, lewd, indecent, or plainly offensive.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier ==\u000a\u000aThe Hazelwood School District case applies the principles set forth in Fraser to curricular matters. In Hazelwood, the Supreme Court upheld a school's decision to censor certain articles in the school newspaper which was produced as part of the school's journalism curriculum. Echoing Fraser, the Supreme Court observed that "[a] school need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with 'its basic educational mission'...even though the government could not censor similar speech outside the school". School authorities and educators do not offend the First Amendment by exercising editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Morse v. Frederick ==\u000a\u000aMorse v. Frederick blends Fraser and Hazelwood, applying them to a school-sanctioned event or activity. While students were along a public street in front of school watching the Olympic Torch Relay pass through, Frederick unfurled a banner bearing the phrase: "BONG HiTS [sic] 4 JESUS". The banner was in plain view of other students. The high school principal seized the banner and suspended Frederick because the banner was perceived to advocate the use of illegal drugs. The Supreme Court held that a principal may, consistent with the First Amendment, restrict student speech at a school event, when that speech is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use. Not only was a school activity involved, but the banner's promotion of illegal drugs was contrary to the school's policy or mission to prevent student drug abuse.\u000a\u000a\u000a== School-specific factors ==\u000aThe right of free speech is not itself absolute: the Court has consistently upheld regulations as to time, place, and manner of speech, provided that they are "reasonable". In applying this reasonableness test to regulations limiting student expression, the Court has recognized that the age and maturity of students is an important factor to be considered.\u000aIn the school context, the United States Supreme Court has identified three major relevant considerations:\u000aThe extent to which the student speech in question poses a substantial threat of disruption (Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist.).\u000aWhether the speech is offensive to prevailing community standards (Bethel School District v. Fraser).\u000aWhether the speech, if allowed as part of a school activity or function, would be contrary to the basic educational mission of the school (Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier).\u000aEach of these considerations has given rise to a separate mode of analysis, and in Morse v. Frederick the Court implied that any one of these may serve as an independent basis for restricting student speech.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Disruption ===\u000aThe problem of disruption is perhaps the most fundamental issue addressed by the courts in student free speech cases.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Offensiveness ===\u000aThe second major question addressed by the courts is closely related to, but nevertheless distinct from, the question of disruption. This is the question of speech which is offensive to prevailing community standards by reason of being vulgar, lewd, indecent, racist, or otherwise inappropriate in a school setting. In Bethel School District v. Fraser, the Supreme Court recognized the special responsibility of the public schools to inculcate moral values and to teach students the boundaries of socially acceptable behavior. It therefore permitted a public school to discipline a student for making sexually suggestive remarks in an address to a school assembly, even though the remarks were not obscene in the traditional sense.\u000aThe ability to regulate inappropriate speech has been found to be especially important in situations where the student speech may have the appearance of being sponsored or endorsed by the school.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Impairing educational mission ===\u000aThe third major area of concern addressed in student free speech cases is whether a particular instance of student speech may be viewed as impairing the school's ability to carry out its educational mission. This concern arises where the speech in question occurs in connection with a school-sponsored or school-controlled activity but is inconsistent with a legitimate pedagogical concern. In such circumstances, the United States Supreme Court has found that student speech may be regulated. For example, in Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier, it held that a school may exercise control over the content of a student newspaper when it attempts to address issues of divorce and teenage pregnancy; in Morse v. Frederick, it permitted a school to exercise control over the words displayed on a large banner at a school-sponsored event, when those words convey a message promoting the use of illegal drugs.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Pure speech ===\u000aOne of these factors is whether the activity sought to be controlled is "pure speech", or sufficiently related to the expression of ideas to fall under the umbrella of the First Amendment. "Pure speech" does not need to involve words but is generally represented by symbols or actions.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Focus of protected speech activity ===\u000aThe focus of the protected speech activity, whether pure speech or not, may affect the propriety of regulation by school officials.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aBroussard v.

aVMyoporum is a genus of flowering plants in the figwort family, Scrophulariaceae (formerly placed in Myoporaceae). There are 30 species in the genus, most of which are endemic to Australia although others are endemic to Pacific Islands, including New Zealand, and one is endemic to two Indian Ocean islands. They are shrubs or small trees with leaves that are arranged alternately and have white, occasionally pink flowers and a fruit that is a drupe.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description ==\u000aPlants in this genus are shrubs or small trees, mostly glabrous with simple leaves that are arranged alternately and often lack a petiole (although the leaves often taper towards the base). The flowers are adapted for pollination by insects and have white, (sometimes pinkish) petals and usually 4 stamens. The fruit is a drupe with its central seed surrounded by a hard endocarp and usually succulent mesocarp.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Taxonomy and naming ==\u000aThe genus Myoporum was first formally described in 1786 by Georg Forster, although he acknowledged Daniel Solander as the author. The name Myoporum is derived from the Ancient Greek myo meaning "to close" or "to be shut" and poros meaning "pore", referring to the ability of (some) plants in this genus to exist in dry areas, or possibly to the appearance of the glands on the leaves.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Distribution ==\u000aThere are 30 species in the genus, which is spread from Mauritius, across Australia to the Pacific Islands. 18 species are endemic to Australia.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Use in horticulture ==\u000aM. parvifolium, M. floribundum and M. bateae are often cultivated as ornamentals, hedges or windbreaks. M. insulare, M. montanum, M. acuminatum and sometimes M. parvifolium are often used as rootstock for Eremophila species, especially those that are difficult to grow from cuttings or that are to be grown in heavier soils. Some, including M. insulare and M. laetum are known to be poisonous to stock.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Species list ==\u000aThe following is a list of the species of Myoporum as described by Robert Chinnock.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Formerly placed here ===\u000aEremophila debilis (Andrews) Chinnock (as M. debile (Andrews) R.Br.)\u000aEremophila deserti (A.Cunn. ex Benth.)

With no electricity or running water and struggling to survive on £240\u2013280 a year (at a time when the average annual salary in the UK was £1,339), life was a constant battle against poverty and hardship, especially in the harsh Pennine winters, when she had to work outside tending her few cattle in ragged clothes in temperatures well below freezing.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Television documentaries ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Too Long a Winter ===\u000aIn the summer of 1972, Hauxwell was discovered by a friend of a researcher at Yorkshire Television while out walking in the Yorkshire Dales. The researcher contacted Barry Cockcroft, a producer at the company, who proposed to make a TV documentary tentatively entitled The Hard Life. The documentary started with her leading a cow into a shed during a blizzard in Baldersdale. After the documentary was first shown in 1972, Yorkshire TV's phone line was jammed for three days with viewers wanting to find out more and help her. ITV received hundreds of phone calls and mail containing gifts and money for \u201cthe old lady in the Yorkshire Dales\u201d. A local factory raised money to fund getting electricity to Low Birk Hatt Farm, and she continued to receive thousands of letters and donations from well-wishers around the world.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== A Winter Too Many ===\u000a\u000aAlmost two decades after Too Long a Winter, in 1989, the same TV crew returned to her farm to catch up with Hauxwell. The second documentary, A Winter Too Many, saw that Hauxwell had a little more money, which she had invested in a few more cows. The crew followed her to London where she was guest of honour at the Women of the Year gala. Out of the spotlight, however, her work on the farm continued, and each winter became harder for her to endure. She commented "In summer I live and in winter I exist" in the film, which also showed her departure just before Christmas 1988. With her health and strength slowly failing, she had to sell her family farm and the animals she adored and move into a warm cottage in a nearby village.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Hannah Goes To Town ===\u000aThe footage of Hauxwell's journey to the Women of the Year gala at the London Savoy Hotel as a guest of honour, where she met HRH The Duchess of Gloucester - which was briefly touched upon in A Winter Too Many- was used alongside additional footage (collected at the time) to document Hauxwell's entire trip.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Hannah Hauxwell: Innocent Abroad ===\u000aIn 1992 director Barry Cockcroft once again ventured into Hauxwell's life making a documentary series which followed Hauxwell on her first trips outside of the UK. Hauxwell visited France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy, during which she met the Pope. The series proved so popular it was followed by another trip, this time to the United States in 1994, filmed as Hannah:USA.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Retirement ==\u000aHauxwell moved to a retirement home in the village of Cotherstone, less than five miles (8 km) from Low Birk Hatt Farm, where the meadows, designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest, are now called Hannah's Meadows. A book, Hannah Hauxwell\u201480 Years in the Dales (W. R. Mitchell) was published in 2008. A new DVD, Hannah Hauxwell\u2014An Extraordinary Life, featuring Too Long A Winter, A Winter Too Many, and Innocent Abroad, was published. Hauxwell was interviewed on Woman's Hour in March 2008. To mark her 85th year, she was interviewed by the Yorkshire Post and revealed that she was still living a frugal life and remained an avid radio listener. She moved to a care home in Barnard Castle in 2016, and to a nursing home in West Auckland the following year. She died there on 30 January 2018.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge (\u660e\u77f3\u6d77\u5ce1\u5927\u6a4b, Akashi Kaiky\u014d \u014c-hashi) is a suspension bridge, which links the city of Kobe on the Japanese mainland of Honshu to Iwaya on Awaji Island. It crosses the busy Akashi Strait (Akashi Kaiky\u014d in Japanese) as part of the Honshu\u2013Shikoku Highway. It was completed in 1998, and has the longest central span of any suspension bridge in the world, at 1,991 metres (6,532 ft; 1.237 mi). It is one of the key links of the Honsh\u016b\u2013Shikoku Bridge Project, which created three routes across the Inland Sea.\u000aFrom April to November each year, tours are offered four days a week. During these tours, participants learn about the bridge's history in detail, and they can visit the top of one of the suspension towers, which are nearly 300 metres in height.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aBefore the Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge was built, ferries carried passengers across the Akashi Strait in Japan. This dangerous waterway often experiences severe storms, and in 1955 two ferries sank in the strait during a storm, killing 168 people. The ensuing shock and public outrage convinced the Japanese government to develop plans for a bridge to cross the strait. The original plan called for a mixed railway-road bridge, but when construction on the bridge began in April 1988, the construction was restricted to road only, with six lanes. Actual construction did not begin until May 1988 and involved more than 100 contractors. The bridge was opened for traffic on April 5, 1998 in a ceremony officiated by the Crown Prince Naruhito and his wife Crown Princess Masako of Japan along with Construction Minister Tsutomu Kawara.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Structure ==\u000a\u000aThe bridge has three spans. The central span is 1,991 m (6,532 ft; 1.237 mi), and the two other sections are each 960 m (3,150 ft; 0.60 mi). The bridge is 3,911 m (12,831 ft; 2.430 mi) long overall. The two towers were originally 1,990 m (6,530 ft; 1.24 mi) apart, but the Great Hanshin earthquake on January 17, 1995, moved the towers so much (only the towers had been erected at the time) that the span had to be increased by 1 m (3.3 ft).\u000aThe bridge was designed with a dual-hinged stiffening girder system, allowing the structure to withstand winds of 286 kilometres per hour (178 mph), earthquakes measuring up to magnitude 8.5, and harsh sea currents. The bridge also contains tuned mass dampers that are designed to operate at the resonance frequency of the bridge to dampen forces. The two main supporting towers rise 282.8 m (928 ft) above sea level, and the bridge can expand because of heat by up to 2 m (6.6 ft) over the course of a day. Each anchorage required 350,000 tonnes (340,000 long tons; 390,000 short tons) of concrete. The steel cables have 300,000 kilometres (190,000 mi) of wire: each cable is 112 centimetres (44 in) in diameter and contains 36,830 strands of wire.\u000aThe Akashi\u2013Kaikyo bridge has a total of 1,737 illumination lights: 1,084 for the main cables, 116 for the main towers, 405 for the girders and 132 for the anchorages. Sets of three high-intensity discharge lamps in the colors red, green and blue are mounted on the main cables. The RGB colour model and computer technology make for a variety of combinations. Twenty-eight patterns are used for occasions as national or regional holidays, memorial days or festivities.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cost ==\u000aThe total cost is estimated at ¥500 billion or US$3.6 billion (per 1998 exchange rates). It is expected to be repaid by charging drivers a toll to cross the bridge. The toll is 2,300 yen and the bridge is used by approximately 23,000 cars per day.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aGreat Seto Bridge\u000aXihoumen Bridge in China ( second longest suspension bridge worldwide)\u000aGreat Belt in Denmark ( third longest suspension bridge worldwide)\u000aHonshu-Shikoku Bridge Expressway Company\u000aHonsh\u016b\u2013Shikoku Bridge Project\u000aKurushima-Kaiky\u014d Bridge\u000aList of longest suspension bridge spans\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aAkashi Kaikyo Bridge at Structurae

aV"Godsend" is the twelfth episode of the first season of the NBC science fiction drama series Heroes.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000aTwo weeks following the events of "Fallout", Peter remains in a coma after consecutively absorbing too many powers. When Simone comes to visit, Nathan asks her to take him to Isaac so that he can learn more about the cause to which Peter has devoted himself.\u000aClaire fakes memory loss in the presence of Mr. Bennet, so he doesn't discover the Haitian disobeyed an order. She is distraught that Zach has no memory of their friendship. She expresses to the Haitian how she cannot go on alone and asks for Zach's memory to be restored and for a meeting with Peter. The Haitian informs her that he cannot restore Zach's memory and that Peter is being watched, and if she visits him, Mr. Bennet will know that she has retained her memories. Claire recreates her original encounter with Zach in "Genesis" by asking him to videotape her as she jumps from a high platform, exhibiting her healing powers in front of him and once again placing her confidence in him.\u000aAt Primatech Paper, Mr. Bennet is unable to isolate the strands of code that determine the origin of Sylar's abilities without killing him. At Matt Parkman's urging, a SWAT team descends on Primatech Paper in search of Sylar, but they fail to yield results and Audrey is reprimanded by her superior. Matt confronts Mr. Bennet, threatening to continue his investigation. Matt later returns home to find Janice ready to leave, awaiting his decision on the status of their marriage. Matt decides to tell her about his ability.\u000aNiki remains confined in a county jail after her surrender to authorities in "Fallout". Her lawyer informs her that the District Attorney is going to seek the death penalty for her crimes; he suggests that she cooperate by revealing the location of the stolen money, but she claims to know nothing about it. Jessica then intermittently takes control of the conversation, making the lawyer question her mental stability.\u000aD.L. Hawkins, once again living at home, is visited by a representative of Mr. Linderman. He is informed that due to Niki's confession, the charges against him are dropped, but his debt to Mr. Linderman remains undecided. He and Micah later visit Niki in prison, where she tells him of her upcoming evaluation at the psychiatric ward and asserts that Jessica is not merely a dual personality. She then pleads with the guard to let her hug Micah; he refuses and eventually takes out his baton. Niki counters by snatching it and snapping it cleanly in half, displaying her super strength. Security personnel then overtake her.\u000aHiro and Ando finally make it to New York City, determining that they must find the sword used by "Future Hiro" in order to fully restore Hiro's abilities. The two locate the sword at the Museum of Natural History, and Hiro slows down time enough to steal it. However, he then discovers it to be a replica provided by Mr. Linderman (as seen in the image above). The two later catch up with Isaac, Simone, and Nathan. Simone is convinced Isaac and Hiro both have powers.\u000aMohinder Suresh, at his apartment in New York, is visited by an FBI agent who states that they are finally taking his warnings seriously after all of Sylar's murders. He then reveals to Mohinder that Eden McCain, whose real name was Sarah Ellis, was found dead at Lake Ramsey in Sudbury, Ontario with an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Mohinder is later visited by Mr. Bennet who tells him of Eden's abilities and her employment with him. He then asks for Mohinder's help, revealing that he needs Chandra Suresh's research. Mohinder refuses, but Mr. Bennet gives him a Primatech business card to contact him if he changes his mind.\u000aTed Sprague is seen practicing using his hands to generate small explosions. Peter experiences another prophetic vision of himself exploding in New York City, this time featuring fleeting visions of an unnamed bearded man. Peter wakes up screaming and leaves the hospital. He books a flight to the desert where nuclear tests were once conducted, and then sees the bearded man from his vision nonchalantly stealing from people he passes on the street. When Peter pursues him, the man is stunned that Peter can see him despite his power of invisibility. Because Peter is around him, Peter absorbs his ability and becomes invisible as well. The bearded man attacks Peter.\u000aAt the very end of the episode, Niki is revealed to have been confined in a padded room in a psychiatric ward, bound in a straitjacket. Miserably, she asks God for help. As the lights switch off, Jessica says, "Who needs God when you've got me?"\u000a\u000a\u000a== Narration ==\u000aAt the end\u000aIn the beginning, there was discovery, a confusion of elements, a first snowfall of impossible change. Old lives undone, left behind, strange faces made familiar, new nightmares to challenge sleep, new friends to feel safe with. Only then comes control, the need to impose order onto chaos through determination, through study, through struggle, all in defiance of a thundering truth. They're here, and the earth shudders underfoot.\u000aThere is no narration at the beginning of the episode.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Ratings ==\u000aThe total viewership for this episode was 14.90 million.

Located in the center of the city less than 3 miles from Bole International Airport, Dembel City Center was one of the first western-style shopping malls to open in Ethiopia. It is a twelve floor structure built in 2002 with 123 spaces designated for use as shops and other business offices. It currently has about 105 shops, restaurants, galleries and other stores open for business.\u000aDembel City Center is part of a modern development of the city center along Bole Road, also known as Airport Road or Africa Avenue. Bole Road like many of the streets in Addis Ababa is experiencing a large construction boom spurred by the growing Ethiopian Economy. However, recent construction to revamp this major avenue has created havoc for the many shopping centers, Dembel City Center being one of them. Some businesses in the mall have been forced to close up shop and move to new locations.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVRobert Morris (born October 19, 1943) is an American composer and music theorist.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Work in music theory ==\u000aAs a music theorist, Morris's work has bridged an important gap between the rigorously academic and the highly experimental. Born in Cheltenham, England in 1943, Morris received his musical education at the Eastman School of Music (B.M. in composition with distinction) and the University of Michigan (M.M. and D.M.A. in composition and ethnomusicology), where he studied composition with John La Montaine, Leslie Bassett, Ross Lee Finney (Swift 2001), and Eugene Kurtz. At Tanglewood, as a Margret Lee Crofts Fellow, he worked with Gunther Schuller. Morris has taught composition, electronic music, and music theory at the University of Hawaii and at Yale University, where he was Chairman of the Composition Department and Director of the Yale Electronic Music Studio. He was also Director of the Computer and Electronic Studio, Director of Graduate (music) Studies, and Associate Professor of Music at the University of Pittsburgh (Swift 2001). In 1980 Morris joined the faculty of the Eastman School of Music where he currently teaches as Professor of Composition. (He was chair of the Composition Department from 1999\u20132005 and before that a member of both the composition and music theory departments.) Other teaching posts have included positions at the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts, the Governor's School for the Arts held at Bucknell University, the University of Pittsburgh Computer Music Workshop, and the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Written works ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Musical compositions ===\u000aMorris has written music for a wide diversity of musical forms and media. He has composed over 160 works including computer and improvisational music. Much of his output from the 1970s is influenced by non-Western music and uses structural principles from Arabic, Indian, Indonesian, Japanese, and early Western musics. While such influences are less noticeable in his more recent works, the temporal and ornamental qualities of Eastern music have permanently affected Morris's style. Moreover, Morris has found much resonance among his musical aesthetics, his experiences in hiking (especially in the Southwestern United States), his study and appreciation of Carnatic Music of South India, and his reading of ancient Indian, Chinese, and Japanese Buddhist texts. Among his present compositional projects is a series of the works to be played outdoors in a natural setting. Seven of these works are complete and have been performed: Playing Outside (2000), Coming Down to Earth (2002), Oracle (2005), Sound/Path/Field (2006), Arboretum (2009), Sun, Moon, Earth (2012) and Four Gardens (2014).\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Books ===\u000aIn addition to his music, Morris has written three books and over 50 articles and reviews which have appeared in the Journal of Music Theory, In Theory Only, Music Theory Spectrum, Journal of the American Musicology Society, and Perspectives of New Music, contributing to theories of musical analysis and aesthetics, compositional design, and electronic and computer music. Morris was the recipient of the "Outstanding Publication Award" of the Society for Music Theory in 1988 for his book, Composition with Pitch-Classes: A Theory of Compositional Design, published by Yale University Press, and in 2001 for his article "Voice Leading Spaces" in Music Theory Spectrum 20/2. Advanced Class Notes for Atonal Theory, is available from Frog Peak Music. Morris is currently Co-editor of Perspectives of New Music and Contributing Editor of The Open Space Magazine. His most recent book is The Whistling Blackbird: Essays and Talks on New Music (2010).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notable students ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aSwift, Richard. 2001.

aVThe Pilatus PC-6 Porter is a single-engined STOL utility aircraft designed by Pilatus Aircraft of Switzerland. First flown in 1959, the PC-6 continues in production at Pilatus Flugzeugwerke in Stans, Switzerland. It has been built in both piston engine- and turboprop-powered versions and was produced under licence for a time by Fairchild Hiller in the United States.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Development ==\u000aOn 4 May 1959, the first prototype, powered by a 254 kW (340 shp) piston engine, made its maiden flight. In early May 1961, the first Turbo Porter, powered by a Turbomeca Astazou II turboprop engine, performed its initial flight. In comparison to its earlier piston engine-powered incarnation, the Astazou II-equipped Turbo Porter had an increased gross capacity and top speed, as well as benefitting from the engine's automatic handling functions. These benefits came at the expense of a greater initial purchase cost and higher fuel consumption. Both the piston and turbine-engine versions of the PC-6 became quickly known for their Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) capabilities, requiring only a very short takeoff run before being ready for rotation prior to taking off.\u000aThe initial turbine-powered models of the PC-6 were equipped with the Astazou II powerplant, however complaints of the reliability of this engine were made. Another early turboprop powerplant that became available for the PC-6 was the Garrett Air Research TPE 331. Some operators such as Air America chose to retrofit their Astazou II-powered PC-6s with the TPE 331 engine in its place. In May 1996, the first PC-6 to be equipped with the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A engine performed its maiden flight.\u000aTo offset rising labour and manufacturing costs in Switzerland, Pilatus distributed manufacturing work on the PC-6 to other countries; in 1993, Czech Republic-based Letov Kbely began manufacturing activity upon the type. In 2013, Pilatus formed a joint venture with Beijing Tian Xing Jian Yu Science Co., Ltd. to locally manufacture the PC-6 and the newer Pilatus PC-12 in Chongqing, China; initially this facility performed subassembly work on the fuselage, and later other elements such as the wings and moving surfaces, which were conveyed to Pilatus' final assembly facility in Stans, Switzerland. Global production of the PC-6 shall be eventually transferred to the Chongqing facility. On 11 December 2014, the first Chinese-assembled PC-6 fuselage was completed. In 2014, the majority of PC-6s delivered that year were to Chinese customers. By April 2016, around 20 PC-6s were in operation in the Chinese market; the type has often been used to replace the Antonov An-2, being reportedly cheaper to operate.\u000aThe Porter was also manufactured under license by Fairchild Hiller in the United States. Roughly 100 of these licence-produced aircraft would be completed, being mainly purchased by civil operators within the US. A number of Fairchild Hiller-built PC-6s were also procured for military operations during the Vietnam War. It received the designation AU-23A Peacemaker for service with the U.S. Air Force. The Peacemaker was fitted with a side-firing 20mm XM-197 Gatling cannon, four wing pylons and a centre fuselage station for external ordnance. However, the AU-23A proved to be troublesome in service. All of them were returned to the continental U.S. and placed into storage after only a single year of operation. In 1979, a pair of UV-20s were assigned to the aviation detachment of the Berlin Brigade in Germany due to their suitability for operating within the heavily restricted airspace; they were fitted for carrying either cargo, up to eleven passengers, or three litters with four medical attendants.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Design ==\u000a\u000aThe Pilatus PC-6 Porter is a Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) utility aircraft. The majority of aircraft are powered by a single Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop engine, which drives a fully reversible, constant-speed, three-bladed HC-B3TN-3D (or an alternative four-bladed HC-D4N-3P unit) Hartzell aluminium propeller via a reduction gearbox. Pilatus claims that it possesses unique STOL capabilities, capable of landing in places only otherwise accessible by rotorcraft. It is fully capable of being operated from unprepared rough airstrips, in remote areas, hot climates and at high altitudes in all-weather conditions. In particular, the undercarriage employed provides for high wing and propeller clearances, making the PC-6 less susceptible to damage than conventional nosewheel-type undercarriages. For further landing versatility, various types of landing gear may be optionally installed allowing it to operate from different types of terrain; options include floats for water landings and skis for landing on snow.\u000aEarly models of the PC-6 were equipped with a full instrument panel as standard, and were reportedly easy for unfamiliar pilots to intuit. Later-manufactured PC-6s are equipped with a Garmin G950 glass cockpit in place of analogue instrumentation; the majority of earlier-produced PC-6s can also be retrofitted with a glass cockpit.  In addition to its flight functionality, the G950 system acts as a remote maintenance unit and electronic flight bag all in one. Two large 10.4-inch liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) are present, functioning as the Primary Flight Display for all key flight information and the Multi-function Display for system/mission management respectively; fully independent secondary flight instrumentation is also provided to provide backup altitude, attitude, and airspeed information in the event of complete electrical failure. The cockpit has been designed for single pilot operations; additional flight controls for a co-pilot can be optionally fitted. Other optional features include an autopilot (capable of operating within all phases of flight), traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS), weather radar, satellite phone, LIDAR, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) and lightning detector; in addition, onboard electrical and avionics equipment are readily modifiable to conform with customer requirements.\u000a\u000aThe airframe is of a rugged and low-maintenance construction; featuring high levels of accessibility, interchangeability, and favourable manning levels. The wings, fuselage, and empennage are manufactured using conventional semi-monocoque construction techniques, the primary structure being composed of aluminium; the central structure retains critical strength despite the cutout areas for the sliding doors of the main cabin. Corrosion resistance is achieved via a combination of plating and a polyurethane-based enamel paint. The simple nature of the structure allows for ease of repair in the field. Features such as low-pressure tyres, twin-clipper disc brakes, and a highly energy-absorbent undercarriage enable the aircraft to be capable of operating from rough or otherwise challenging terrain.\u000aFor role flexibility, individual aircraft can be easily converted between various mission types, such as transport, paradrop, aerial photography, surveillance, air medical services and search and rescue duties. A maximum of ten passengers, or a 2,200 lb payload, may be carried within the aircraft's main cabin area within the rear section of the fuselage; the standard passenger seats are designed to allow for rapid removal and may be stowed within an optional separate externally-accessed seat stowage compartment behind the main cabin. The main cabin area is furnished with soundproofing measures, ventilation, and heating as standard. A maximum of three fuel tanks can also be carried in the main cabin, accordingly reducing payload capacity, to increase the aircraft's flight endurance. In addition to the large sliding doors at either side of the main cabin, separate hinged doors are present on either side of the cockpit; an optional pilot-controlled trapdoor, to accommodate supply drops or surveillance payloads, may also be installed in the center of the cabin floor without any design changes required. Additional equipment include a firefighting system, aerial application system, underwing tanks, sand filters, propeller de-icing system, mudguard, tailwheel debris guard, oxygen system, and additional power distribution system.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Operational history ==\u000aThe PC-6 is noted for its Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) performance on almost any type of terrain - it can take off within a distance of 640 feet (195 m) and land within a distance of 427 feet (130 m) while carrying a payload of 2,646 lbs (1,200 kg). Thanks to its STOL performance, the PC-6 holds the world record for highest landing by a fixed-wing aircraft, at 18,865 feet (5,750 m), on the Dhaulagiri glacier in Nepal.\u000aDue to the type's favourable STOL characteristics, described by Flying Magazine as being "one of the most helicopter-like airplanes in terms of takeoff performance", Pilatus has deliberately marketed the PC-6 towards helicopter operators at times, feeling the type to be complimentary to their typical mode of operation. According to Pilatus, the PC-6 can provide very similar surveillance capabilities to a rotorcraft at a significantly lower cost to operate and procure.\u000a\u000aDuring its early service, the PC-6 Porter was noted for its high level of comfort and usability against competing aircraft. The type has also proven to have a long service life; by 1993, roughly 440 of the 500 PC-6 Turbo Porters completed by that point were still in service.\u000aDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)-controlled airline Air America operated up to 23 PC-6s at a time. Many of these were operated in the South-East Asia region, including South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The type was used for various missions including paradropping supplies to troops, passenger transport, psy ops, reconnaissance, prisoner conveyance, airborne radio relay, and other intelligence operations.\u000aSince 1976, the Austrian Air Force has operated a fleet of 12 PC-6 Porters as the mainstay of their fixed-wing transport fleet; the type has been used in various support roles, including transport, Search and Rescue, firefighting, observation, target-towing and paradropping.\u000aAccording to Flying Magazine, around 40 per cent of all PC-6s in use in Europe during the early 1990s were being used by skydivers.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Variants ==\u000a\u000aPC-6/340 Porter\u000aInitial production version, powered by a 254-kW (340-hp) Lycoming GSO-480-B1A6 flat-six piston engine.

He graduated from Herzen University, and later, between 1959 and 1969, taught Russian literature. After that he became a full-time writer and poet. Since then he published about 15 collections of his poetry and two books of his essays. In 1965 he became a member of the Writers' Union, in 1987 joined the Russian PEN Center. He is also editor-in-chief of Biblioteka poeta (the "Library of the Poet" series). His only son Eugene and his family live in Israel.\u000aIn October 1993, he signed the Letter of Forty-Two.\u000aHis poetry resembles that of Acmeists. He usually doesn't write in free verse and seldom experiments or tries to elaborate a new poetic form, preferring to write in a classic, 19th century-like style. The Nobel Prize winner Brodsky once called Kushner "one of the best lyrical poets of the 20th century", adding that his name "is to stand in the line of names dear to the heart of every native Russian speaker"\u000aTranslations of Kushner's poetry into English, Italian and Dutch were published in book form; several poems were also translated to German, French, Japanese, Hebrew, Czech and Bulgarian.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Books of verse ===\u000a\u000aThe First Impression (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) 1962.\u000aThe Night Watch (Russian: \u041d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0440) 1966.\u000aOmens (Russian: \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044b) 1969.\u000aThe Writing (Russian: \u041f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u043e) 1974.\u000aThe Direct Speech (Russian: \u041f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0447\u044c) 1975.\u000aThe Voice (Russian: \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441) 1978.\u000aTavrichesky Garden (Russian: \u0422\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0434) 1984.\u000aDay Dreams (Russian: \u0414\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043d\u044b) 1986.\u000aThe Fence Hedge (Russian: \u0416\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0437\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u044c) 1988.\u000aNight Music (Russian: \u041d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430) 1991.\u000aOn the Dark Star (Russian: \u041d\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u0440\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0435) 1994.\u000aThe Milfoil (Russian: \u0422\u044b\u0441\u044f\u0447\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a) 1998.\u000aBank of Clouds (Russian: \u041b\u0435\u0442\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u044f\u0434\u0430) 2000.\u000aBushes (Russian: \u041a\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a) 2002.\u000aThe Cold May (Russian: \u0425\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0439) 2005.\u000aIn the New Century (Russian: \u0412 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0435) 2006.\u000aOne Cannot Choose Times...(five decades) (Russian: \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0442 (\u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0439)) 2007.\u000aApollo in the Grass. 2015.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Works in prose ===\u000aApollo under Snow (Russian: \u0410\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043b\u043e\u043d \u0432 \u0441\u043d\u0435\u0433\u0443)\u000aWave and Stone (Russian: \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c)\u000aThe Fifth Element (selected verse and articles) (Russian: \u041f\u044f\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0438\u0445\u0438\u044f)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Awards ==\u000aHis numerous awards include the Russian National Award (1996) and the prestigious Pushkin Prize for poetry, bestowed on him by Russian president Vladimir Putin in 2001.

aVKevin Hofland (born 7 June 1979) is a Dutch retired footballer who played as a central defender.\u000aOver the course of ten seasons (in a career which lasted 15) he amassed Eredivisie totals of 182 games and eight goals, namely for PSV and Feyenoord. He also represented one team each in Germany and Cyprus.\u000aA Dutch international in the 2000s, Hofland earned 7 caps.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Club career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Fortuna ===\u000aHofland was born in Heerlen, but grew up in Brunssum, Limburg. He joined local SV Limburgia at the age of just four, moving to the professionals with Fortuna Sittard six years later.\u000aHofland played in various positions during his youth career, mainly as a left midfielder or left back. In 1995, he was reconverted by manager Henk Duut into a central defender, where he remained for the rest of his career.\u000aOn 10 September 1997, Hofland made his Eredivisie debut with Fortuna, against Sparta Rotterdam (1\u20131 away draw). He finished his first season with only six league appearances, but subsequently became a starter, helping the side to the 12th-place in the 1999\u201300 campaign.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== PSV ===\u000aIn summer 2000, Hofland signed with national giants PSV Eindhoven. Despite his young age and the heavy competition within the team, he quickly became an important player in the team's defence but, after a serious ankle injury in a 2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League group stage match against Arsenal, he lost his starting position to Wilfred Bouma.\u000aHofland played 20 matches in 2003\u201304 to help the Philips outfit finished second in the domestic championship, to AFC Ajax. After the arrival of Alex on loan from Chelsea he decided to leave the club, having won a total of four major titles.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Wolfsburg ===\u000aFormer PSV manager Eric Gerets was one of the main reasons for Hofland to join VfL Wolfsburg in Germany. He went on to play three seasons in the Bundesliga, making his debut in the competition on 7 August 2004 in a 2\u20131 win at Borussia Dortmund (90 minutes played).\u000aIn his last two years with the Wölfen, Hofland played in 49 games combined scoring twice, but the team ranked 15th on both occasions, being the first side above the relegation zone.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Feyenoord / AEK ===\u000aOn 28 June 2007, Hofland signed with Feyenoord, for four years. He only managed to appear in eight league games in the 2009\u201310 season, winning the first and only Dutch Cup of his career in 2008.\u000aIn the 2010 offseason Hofland was loaned to Cypriot First Division club AEK Larnaca FC, helping the team to the fourth position in both the regular season and the second stage, whilst scoring a career-best five goals and being team captain.\u000aHofland signed a permanent deal with AEK in July 2011. On 17 March of the following year, however, he officially retired from professional football after another injury to his ankle.\u000a\u000a\u000a== International career ==\u000aOn 15 November 2000, Hofland played his first international match with Netherlands, starting in an away friendly with Spain in Sevilla (2\u20131 win).\u000aFour of his seven caps for the Oranje came during the ill-fated 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career statistics ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Club ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== International ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Honours ==\u000aFortuna\u000aKNVB Cup: Runner-up 1998\u201399\u000aPSV\u000aEredivisie: 2000\u201301, 2002\u201303\u000aJohan Cruijff Shield: 2000, 2001\u000aKNVB Cup: Runner-up 2000\u201301\u000aFeyenoord\u000aKNVB Cup: 2007\u201308; Runner-up 2009\u201310\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aHofland is married.

aV"Green Grass and High Tides" is a song by the Southern rock band Outlaws. It is the tenth and final track on the band's debut album, Outlaws. The song is one of their best known, and has received extensive play on album-oriented radio stations, although it was never released as a single. The song is notable for having two extended guitar solos that stretch the song to nearly 10 minutes.\u000aA cover version of the song is playable in the music video game Rock Band, acting as the final song for the guitar's solo career. Through the game, the song saw some renewed popularity in the late 2000s.\u000aOutlaws founding member Hughie Thomasson said:\u000aI wrote that song in St Augustine, Florida. We went to a cookout on the beach and everybody forgot to bring their guitars. I was standing by the ocean and there was a breeze and the words kept coming to me. It\u2019s about all the rock stars I liked that died had come back and were playing a show just for me. Like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison. And eventually more of course.\u000aHenry Paul told Songfacts that this song is not about marijuana, but about deceased rock and roll luminaries, and the title, he says, was taken from the 1966 "Best Of" collection by the Rolling Stones called Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass):\u000a\u000a"From what I gather, there was an album out, the best of The Rolling Stones, called High Tides and Green Grass. That was the name of the Rolling Stones' greatest hits - this is like 1966 - and I think it was a manifestation of that title turned in reverse, 'Green Grass and High Tides.' I know that much. And I know that it was a song written for rock and roll illuminaries, from Janis Joplin to Jimi Hendrix, and it had nothing to do with marijuana. But it had to do with, I think, a specific person's [Thomasson's] lyrical look at rock and roll legends. 'As kings and queens bow and play for you.' It's about Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. 'Castles of stone, soul and glory.' A lot of it is just sort of a collage of words that really don't have all that much to do with anything, they just fit and sounded right. But I have to say it's one of my favorite lyrics. My songwriting is more Steinbeck, really rooted in accuracy and reality; this is definitely Alice In Wonderland. It's the whole 'White Rabbit.' It's sort of like one of those magic lyrical moments that will forever be mysteriously, unclearly conceived."\u000a\u000a"Green Grass and High Tides" was the usual show closer for the Outlaws and the 20 minute+ version can be found on the concert album Bring It Back Alive (1978). The song is mentioned in Molly Hatchet's song "Gator Country", on Molly Hatchet (1978), and was featured on the Harley Davidson Road Songs album in 1995. The song also featured as a tribute to the recently departed from Lynyrd Skynyrd. The intro was: We'd like to take a minute to remember some very good friends of ours, and friends of yours--the Lynyrd Skynyrd Band.\u000aIt was featured in the award-winning TV series Breaking Bad, in the second season episode "Phoenix".\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Ropewalk Dingle Countryside Site is located by the river in the centre of Bridgnorth, in Shropshire. The Grid Reference is SO718934. The site was historically involved in the extension of the Severn Valley Railway which travelled through this area to Ironbridge. The dingle area has many remains of this historic railway left behind which serves as a reminder to the site. One of these features include an abandoned railway tunnel which marks the Southern boundary of the site, and is owned and maintained by British Rail.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Background ==\u000aRopewalk Dingle is part of the prior Severn Cliff House Gardens, but is now currently owned and managed by Shropshire Council.\u000aIn 2008 it was officially named Ropewalk Dingle by a public online vote, as it previously had many other names such as The Dingle, Bramble Ridge, and Severn Cliff.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Access ==\u000aPresently there are three main paths to get to Ropewalk Dingle. Firstly, following a path from Cliffs Road Entrance leads to Bridgnorth Leisure Centre. This pathway links in with St Leonards Church, another curious site in Bridgnorth. Another access point is one already known most by both tourists and the locals, but this one leads to the Riverside instead. Access to Riverside can be found by Friars Street, another route walked by tourists, this travels from the town to the River Severn.\u000aThese three entry pathways to the site make it ideal for people to access it at different areas in Bridgnorth.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aV"Stay with Me" (often credited as "Stay with Me Baby") is a soul song co-written by Jerry Ragovoy and George David Weiss. It was first recorded in 1966 by Lorraine Ellison, and produced by Ragovoy.\u000aEllison recorded "Stay With Me" at a last-minute booking, following a studio cancellation by Frank Sinatra. With a 46-piece orchestra already hired, Warner Bros. Records asked Ragovoy, with two days' notice, to take over the session at no cost. Ragovoy and arranger Garry Sherman worked up an orchestral arrangement of the song, and called Ellison into the studio to record it live with the orchestra. The recording was engineered by Phil Ramone.\u000a"Stay With Me" was issued as a single on the Warner record label. It entered the U.S. Billboard R&B chart on October 15, 1966, and reached No. 11; and peaked at No. 64 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Her follow-up single was "Heart Be Still", a minor hit in 1967.\u000aThe track has appeared on numerous compilation albums over the years, but 2006's Sister Love: The Warner Bros.

aVOld North Cemetery is a historic cemetery on Maplewood Avenue in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It is a roughly 1.5-acre (0.61 ha) parcel of land north of the city center on the shore of North Mill Pond. Its earliest burials are dated to 1751, although it was not formally established as a cemetery until 1753. It is the largest of the city's 18th century cemeteries, and is remarkable for the relatively distant locations some of the stonecarvers came from whose work appears in it. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Setting ==\u000aOld North Cemetery is located north of downtown Portsmouth, on the southwest side of Maplewood Avenue. It is bounded on the southeast by a railroad yard, and the northwest by Union Cemetery. To the west it borders a portion of the North Mill Pond. This setting is in stark contrast to its historical surroundings. At the time of its founding, it was essentially laid out on a peninsula, and the pond was more of a tidal inlet of the Piscataqua River. Its present surroundings are the result of intensive development and redevelopment in the 19th and 20th centuries.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description ==\u000aThe cemetery is in a nearly rectangular irregular shape, about 1.5 acres (0.61 ha) in size. The land slopes down toward the water, and has a number of hillocks, most of which are topped by graves. It is separated from Union Cemetery by a row of trees, and from the railroad yard by a chain link fence. A low retaining wall separates it from Maplewood Avenue.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe site was first used as a cemetery in 1751, and was formally acquired by the city in 1753. It was not its first cemetery, which was located near present-day Mechanic Street. It is the largest of those laid out in the 18th century, built to address increased demand in the growing community. It soon became a favored burying ground, and a number of locally and nationally prominent figures are interred there.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notable burials ==\u000aJohn Langdon, governor of New Hampshire, one of the first two U.S. senators from the state\u000aWoodbury Langdon, merchant, delegate from New Hampshire to Continental Congress, New Hampshire Superior Court justice, brother of John Langdon\u000aPrince Whipple, slave, freed by William Whipple in 1781\u000aWilliam Whipple, signer of U.S. Declaration of Independence, brigadier general in New Hampshire Militia\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aNational Register of Historic Places listings in Rockingham County, New Hampshire\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

DPIPWE's responsibilities also include maintaining the security of land tenure, administration of much of the state's Crown lands and delivery of government services through Service Tasmania.\u000aThe department is led by its departmental secretary, John Whittington, who reports both the Minister for Primary Industries and Water, currently Jeremy Rockliff, and the Minister for Environment, Parks and Heritage, currently Matthew Groom.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History and structure ==\u000aThe department was known as the Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment from 1998 until April 2002, when its planning responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice and its environment responsibilities handed to a newly constituted Department of Tourism, Arts and the Environment.\u000aBetween April 2002 and 30 June 2009 it was known as the Department of Primary Industries and Water. On 1 July 2009 it was amalgamated with the Environment, Parks and Heritage divisions of the Department of Environment, Parks, Heritage and the Arts to form the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment. This returned the DPIPWE to a similar size and structure as to what it was between 1998 and 2002. In 1996 the department entered into a joint venture agreement with the University of Tasmania to form the Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research (TIAR). Between 2005 and 2009 all DPIPWE's agricultural research, development and extension staff and facilities were transferred to TIAR.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aList of Tasmanian government agencies\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial site

aVWomen was an art rock band formed in 2007 in Calgary. Their debut album Women was released on Chad VanGaalen's label Flemish Eye on July 8, 2008 in Canada and on Jagjaguwar in the United States on October 7, 2008. It was rumoured that the band broke up on October 29, 2010, after a fight on stage at a show at the Lucky Bar in Victoria although their management stated that they merely cancelled the rest of their tour.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aWomen's debut album, Women, recorded by Chad VanGaalen, gained positive recognition from music publications including Pitchfork, AllMusic, PopMatters, Vue Weekly, and  as well as other varied music blogs. The band's sound has been likened to "sunny Beach Boys pop [...] dragged into a dark alley and gleefully mutilated", as well as compared to other bands The Velvet Underground and The Zombies. Pitchfork Media named their song "Black Rice" from their debut album the 18th best track of 2008.\u000aAfter the release of their debut album Women extensively toured throughout 2008 and 2009, performing over 180 times in North America, Europe and the UK. Highlight performances took place at Barcelona's Primavera Sound, Austin's SXSW, Chicago's Pitchfork Music Festival and London's The Lexington. The band has toured or performed with Mogwai, Abe Vigoda, Dungen, Deerhunter, and Eric's Trip. The song "Black Rice" was also listed by Pitchfork as the 410th best song of the 2000s.\u000aWomen's second album, Public Strain, was released in Canada, via Flemish Eye, and in the United States, UK, and Europe, via Jagjaguwar , on September 28, 2010. The album received praise from across the media spectrum. Pitchfork, Exclaim!, Filter, and the BBC turned-in positive reviews in favour of the album. The band began a European tour, followed by a US tour in the fall of 2010. It was rumoured that the band broke up on October 29, 2010 after a fight on stage at a show at the Lucky Bar in Victoria although their management stated that they merely cancelled the rest of their tour. Matt Flegel later confirmed in an interview with Marc Riley on BBC 6 that a fight had in fact broken out on stage between Patrick and the band, prematurely ending their tour. Pitchfork released a three-song live video in February 2011 shot in an empty factory a few weeks before the band's indefinite hiatus\u000aSome members of Women also played in the live band of Chad VanGaalen. Pat Flegel was a member of the band Fels-Naptha, and Michael Wallace is a former member of the bands Friendo and Azeda Booth, and toured with Porcelain Raft. Christopher Reimer toured with The Dodos during the summer and fall of 2011.\u000aOn February 8, 2012, guitarist Christopher Reimer performed at Weeds Cafe in Calgary, recorded by Brad Hawkins. Thirteen days later, on February 21, Reimer died in his sleep. In 2012 Chad van Gaalen released The Chad Tape, containing 9 Reimer solo tracks.\u000aFollowing the dissolution of the band and Reimer's death, Matthew Flegel and Michael Wallace formed the band Preoccupations (formerly Viet Cong) in 2012, while Pat Flegel formed Cindy Lee.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Studio albums ===\u000aWomen (Flemish Eye / Jagjaguwar, 2008)\u000aPublic Strain (Flemish Eye / Jagjaguwar, 2010)\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Singles ===\u000a"Service Animal/Grey Skies" 7" (Jagjaguwar, 2010)\u000a"Women / Cold Pumas / Fair Ohs / Friendo Split 7"" (Faux Discx, 2011)\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Chris Reimer ===\u000aThe Chad Tape (bandcamp, 2012)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Video ==\u000aPitchfork Presents: A Three Song Live Special (Feb 2011)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Members ==\u000aFormer\u000a\u000aPatrick Flegel \u2013 guitar, vocals (2007-2012)\u000aMatthew Flegel \u2013 bass, percussion, vocals (2007-2012)\u000aMichael Wallace \u2013 drums (2007-2012)\u000aChristopher Reimer \u2013 guitar, samples, vocals (2007-2012; deceased)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aWomen at Flemish Eye\u000aWomen at Jagjaguwar

aVLittle Falls is an area of rapids located where the Potomac River crosses the Atlantic Seaboard fall line, descending from the harder and older rocks of the Piedmont Plateau to the softer sediments of the Atlantic coastal plain. Situated at the point where Washington, DC, Maryland and Virginia meet, it is the first "cataract", or barrier, to navigation encountered on the Potomac River in going upstream. It may be viewed from the heavily-trafficked Chain Bridge, about a half mile downstream. It is named in contradistinction to Great Falls, about 5 miles further upstream.\u000aCaptain John Smith (1580\u20131631) of England was the first European to explore the Potomac as far as Little Falls. When he arrived there in 1608 he noted that "as for deer, buffaloes, bears and turkeys, the woods do swarm with them and the soil is extremely fertile." By 1757, the name of a nearby Anglican Church building \u2014 "The Falls Church" \u2014 referenced this location near the main tobacco rolling road circumventing Little Falls. The local settlement of Falls Church, Virginia, which grew up there, soon followed suit.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Namesakes ==\u000aLittle Falls Dam (Potomac River)\u000aLittle Falls Reservoir, Montgomery County, Maryland\u000aLittle Falls Branch, Montgomery County, Maryland\u000aLittle Falls Park, Montgomery County, Maryland\u000aLittle Falls Parkway, Montgomery County, Maryland\u000aThe Falls Church, Falls Church, Virginia (est. 1732)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVJames Henry Neel Reed (28 April 1884 \u2013 16 June 1968) was an American fiddler and banjoist in the Appalachian music tradition. Reed became known for his fiddle tunes only after Alan Jabbour and the Hollow Rock String Band spread his music. Henry Reed never had a professional career as a fiddler but was able to influence many other musicians through a relationship with his apprentice Alan Jabbour.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aHenry Reed was born in Mercer County, West Virginia on April 28, 1884. He was the youngest of the eight children of Marion Reed and Sophia Catherine Underwood Reed. Henry spent most of his life in the area surrounding his birthplace. At the age of 23 Henry married Nettie Ann Virginia Mullins on December 11, 1907. They settled down in Glen Lyn, Virginia just a few miles from Mercer County. Reed spent the next few years working at the Appalachian Power plant and raising his family, which eventually grew to twelve children.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aHenry Reed is one of the few Appalachian musicians that became known for his music without playing professionally. Reed was recognized for his fiddling shortly after meeting Alan Jabbour in 1966. Jabbour was an apprentice to Reed, listening, recording and learning Reed's tunes on the Fiddle and harmonica. Alan Jabbour's band, the Hollow Rock String Band, used many of Reed's tunes in their music. As the band played Reed's tunes at more shows he became more of a public figure, and eventually began to be recognized for his music. In 1968, the Hollow Rock String band released a long-playing record, The Hollow Rock String Band: Traditional Dance Tunes. This record was made up of many tunes from Henry Reed and allowed many other musicians to be inspired by Henry Reed's music. The tune "Over the Waterfall" was produced by the Hollow Strings Band and is one of Reed's most well-known compositions.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Fiddle Technique ===\u000aHenry Reed's tunes include a variety of genres. According to Alan Jabbour's recordings, Henry often played "classic tunes, classic vintage, waltzes, schottisches, clogs, rag-like pieces from both grassroots and popular sources and several marches from the nineteenth-century fifing tradition." Not all of the techniques Reed used to produce these genres were common among many fiddlers. Reed held the fiddle under his chin allowing his left hand to be free. Freeing up his left hand made it possible for him to achieve notes in the third position which included keys like a high D or C. Henry Reed also had a particular way of holding the bow at the frog rather than choking it up higher like other fiddlers do. By gripping the bow on the frog Reed was able to achieve slurs into his playing; This style was referred to as the "longbow style." Slurs are multiple notes in the same stroke of the bow allowing for a more diverse sound to come from the fiddle. The most unusual feature of his bow technique was the placement of his fifth finger underneath the nut rather than on the top of it.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Death ==\u000aHenry Reed Died at the age of 84 on February 8, 1968 due to a blood clot. The blood clot that was formed a month after a surgery to have his foot amputated because of an infection. Henry's wife, Nettie died the following year. They are buried next to each other in Pearisburg, Va.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Legacy ==\u000aHenry Reed's name and legacy continue on through the Henry Reed Fund  and the Annual Henry Reed Memorial Fiddlers Convention.\u000aThe Henry Reed Fund was started by Alan Jabbour in 1999. Alan explains why he created this fund by expressing his desire "to provide support for initiatives benefiting folk artists and taping the collections of the American Folklife Center. In doing so, [the Henry Reed Fund] also commemorates the important cultural process through which the artistry of people like Henry Reed is shared with younger generations and provides continuing enrichment for our cultural life."  The Annual Henry Reed Convention was started in 2003 in honor of Reed. This convention allows fiddlers to get together in Glen, Virginia once a year to share their music.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aFiddle Tunes of the Old Frontier: The Henry Reed Collection via Library of Congress

aVThe Masterdome was located at 137 S. G St. in San Bernardino, California and was a popular concert, sports and rave venue until its destruction. Originally, it was a trolley barn for the Pacific Electric Railway. The Masterdome was home to many concerts, sporting events and raves from 1996 to the Summer of 2001. The city of San Bernardino unsuccessfully tried to close the Masterdome. It was ultimately closed on August 2, 2001 by the San Bernardino fire department recalled the entertainment permits and condemned the venue "Unsafe" due to a collapsing roof. The final event at the Masterdome was Summer Dreams by 26C which took place late in the summer of 2001. The building had already been condemned, thus the entire event took place in the outdoor area.\u000aThe venue featured a large indoor boxing arena setting, full sized bleachers on both sides of the dance floor, a large balcony at the front portion of the venue, with a large stage filled with massive concert audio, intelligent lighting, colored scanning lasers and video. The venue was self facilitated with a professional production crew and show management team, led by Matthew Earnest (Event-Ops). Typically outside promoters would manage the promotion and talent, occasionally decorated per event theme, and leave the shows' operation, security and control of the location.\u000aThe Masterdome featured three areas for its guests. The outside area had various curbs for people to sit on along the fence area and by the building for people to cool off once the inside of the Masterdome got too hot (See Great Wall Of China). The Venue was previously known as The San Bernardino Sports Arena, also referred to as the G Street Arena. The venue was leased by Ezzat Soliman owner of the Showcase Theatre in Corona, CA - Showcase Theatre in San Diego, CA, CA and formerly of Spanky's Cafe in Riverside, CA.\u000aThe Masterdome was one of the constant weekly venues in LA that allowed the Rave scene to thrive, since it allowed underage club goers to attend. Although So Cal youths had difficulties getting into 21 and over clubs, they could enter Masterdome with ease to all partygoers. Groups such as TYCO, R.O.A.M, E-Tard Ent, Neosapiens and other West Coast promoters would host events with up to 3200 people into this small venue.\u000aA metal concert featuring the bands Napalm Death and Neurosis in early 1999 resulted in the death of 14-year-old Christopher King, of Fontana, CA. The youth had made an attempt to stage dive and crowd surf into an open area, causing the youth to fall on the concrete, severely damaging his spine. A day after the event, the teen died due to lethal nervous system shock.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aList of electronic dance music venues\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVAn Immortal is one of a group of fictional characters seen in the movies and series of the Highlander franchise. Since they are immune to disease and stop aging after becoming Immortals, they can live forever and die only when they are beheaded.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Origin ==\u000aThe Immortals were first introduced in Highlander in 1986. They were created by script writer Gregory Widen who, according to Bill Panzer, producer of the Highlander franchise, "was a student at film school, and he wrote this as his writing class project. (...) He was apparently travelling through Scotland on his summer vacation and he was standing in front of a suit of armor, and he wondered, 'What would it be like if that guy was alive today?' And that's where everything fell into place \u2014 the idea that there are Immortals and they were in conflict with each other, leading secret lives that the rest of us are unaware of."\u000aIn the Highlander universe, the origin of the Immortals is unknown. Panzer states, "We don't know where they come from. Maybe they come from the Source." It is not known yet what the Source actually is. An attempt to explain the origin of the Immortals was made in the theatrical version of Highlander II: The Quickening (1991), which revealed that Immortals are aliens from the planet Zeist. This was edited out of the 1995 director's cut, Highlander II: The Renegade Version, in which the Immortals are from Earth, but from a distant past. Neither of the two versions is mentioned in later movies or the television series.\u000aIn either version of Highlander II, Immortals themselves do not know where they come from or for what purpose they exist. In Highlander, the Immortal mentor Ramírez, when asked by newly Immortal Connor MacLeod about their origins, answers, "Why does the sun come up? Or are the stars just pinholes in the curtain of night? Who knows?" In Highlander: Endgame, Connor MacLeod says, "We are the seeds of legend, but our true origins are unknown. We simply are." In the television series episode "Mountain Men", Duncan MacLeod expresses the same ignorance when he tells Caleb Cole, a fellow Immortal, "Whatever gods made you and me... made us different," and in his next line, deleted from the episode, he says, "They're just having a little fun."\u000aWherever they come from, the Highlander franchise assumes that there have always been Immortals on Earth, well before the beginning of civilization. In the first film, Ramírez's narrative starts, "From the dawn of time we came; moving silently down through the centuries, living many secret lives..." and in Highlander: Endgame, Connor's narrative says, "In the days before memory, there were the Immortals. We were with you then, and we are with you now."\u000a\u000a\u000a== The Rules ==\u000aThe Immortals do not live as a united people on a territory of their own, but are scattered around the world and across history. The only bond between them are oral traditions called the Rules transmitted from teacher to student. The creator of the Rules is unknown. The Rules are never enumerated, like a body of laws, but they are quoted according to the circumstances. They are taught to newborn Immortals by Immortal mentors called First Teachers (see below). The main Rules are:\u000aNo Immortal may fight on Holy Ground, no matter who regards it as Holy\u000aImmortal combat is one on one only \u2014 no outside interference\u000aMortals must not learn about Immortals \u2014 if you are killed, you move on\u000aWhen only a few are left, all Immortals will feel drawn to a distant land, to fight for the Prize \u2014 this is the time of the Gathering\u000aIn the end, there can be only one \u2014 the last one will receive all the power of all the Immortals who ever lived\u000aCreative Consultant David Abramowitz says, "When you do a show like this [Highlander: The Series], what you do is you make up a lot of it as you go along. The fans used to ask, 'Do you know all the rules from the beginning?' and it's just like in life: You don't know any of the rules. You make them up as you go along and you try your best to be consistent and so that no one turns around, and says, 'Wait a minute, you're cheating!' Because that's one thing we didn't want to do. We didn't want to ever cheat."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The Game ===\u000aThe Rules dictate that all Immortals are to fight and behead each other until only one of them remains. As Ramírez reminds Connor MacLeod, "If your head comes away from your neck, it's over." This concept of Immortals beheading each other to be the "last man standing" is referred to as "the Game" and is summarized in the signature Highlander motto, "In the End, there can be only one." As a result, Immortals who live long enough develop strong fighting skills, usually transmitted from teacher to student, as Ramírez did with Connor in Highlander. Most Immortals can fight with several kinds of weapons (axe, sickle, machete, mace, etc.), but the most common is the sword. Consequently, Immortals are usually very fond of their weapons, and almost always have them handy. The script of the Highlander: The Series pilot episode "The Gathering" says about Duncan MacLeod: "Seemingly out of nowhere MacLeod lifts a beautiful Samurai sword. We can see that it is as familiar to him as a .38 Police Special would be to a cop." When he gives a similar sword to Immortal Felicia Martins, Duncan tells her, "Take good care of it. Make it a part of you. It may be the only friend you have." She later breaks the sword in a fight with Duncan, showing neglect of the sword and henceforth demonstrating the student-teacher relationship throughout the series.\u000aThe Rules also dictate that when one challenges another to combat, the two Immortals are supposed to duel one-on-one. For example, in "The Gathering", Slan Quince challenges Duncan MacLeod then gets challenged by Connor MacLeod at the same time. He protests to them both: "Not two on one!", Connor MacLeod answers, "Thanks, Slan. I know the rules. You and me. Now!" This does not always happen and battles may be unfair, cheating is usually a sign of an evil Immortal. Examples of cheating include the group of Immortals who served under Immortal Jacob Kell in Highlander: Endgame, Slan Quince's modified sword which fires a dagger from its hilt, and Zachary Blaine keeping a gun to slow down his adversaries. If the Rules are interpreted strictly, once two Immortals begin dueling, no outside interference is permitted, even to save a friend or innocent. For example, Duncan warns Richie that if he engages the vengeful Annie Devlin or the relentless Mako in a duel, Duncan will not permit himself to intervene. However, there is also a way around the one-on-one rule that even good Immortals have been known to invoke. The Quickening that the winning Immortal receives at the end of a fight is extremely draining, and leaves the recipient unable to protect themselves, allowing another Immortal an easy kill. Therefore, some Immortals will travel in pairs or groups to discourage challenges, or will attack an opponent in pairs; while one fights, the other will await the outcome to take revenge if necessary.\u000aThe Immortals play the Game in accordance with their personalities. Some, like Slan Quince, go head hunting full-time; some others, like Methos, only fight when they are challenged, to defend their head (which seems to be rather common with extremely old Immortals). Immortals are free to play the Game or not and some chose to "retire" for various reasons. Duncan MacLeod temporarily retires in 1872 because he is tired of death after his wife and adopted son are murdered. Some Immortals, like the pacifist Darius and the epicurean John Durgan, even attempt to retire from the game completely. Darius, who was a great general in Late Antiquity, retires permanently because he turned his back on war. Some retired Immortals chose to get on with their life without carrying a sword, like Grace Chandel, but they are in particular danger of losing their heads. A safe option for Immortals who wish to retire from the Game is to live on Holy Ground. However, this leaves them vulnerable to the Hunters.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Holy Ground ===\u000aThe Rules forbid the Immortals to fight on Holy Ground. Holy Ground is defined as any land or building held sacred by any people in the world. Examples of Holy Ground include cathedrals, churches, chapels, cemeteries, monasteries, and Native-American sacred land. The interpretation of this rule changed as the series progressed. Highlander states that the Holy Ground rule was a tradition. Highlander II: The Quickening calls it the "Golden Rule". In the Highlander: The Series episode "The Hunters", Duncan MacLeod says, "Even the most evil of us wouldn't desecrate Holy Ground." In "Unholy Alliance" (1994), Horton is attacked by Duncan MacLeod in the Dawson family crypt and says, "Holy Ground, MacLeod ! Shame on you... You're forgetting the rules. I tried to get Xavier [St. Cloud] to come but even he wouldn't kill here." In the episode "Little Tin God", Watcher Joe Dawson mentions that according to legend, this rule was broken in AD 79 in Pompeii, implying that it resulted in the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius and the destruction of the city. In Highlander III: The Sorcerer, during a fight in a Buddhist shrine between Connor MacLeod and antagonist Kane, Connor's blade shatters and the power of the shrine is revealed to Kane. In Highlander: The Search for Vengeance, Colin MacLeod is struck by lightning for refusing to put down his sword inside Stonehenge. Mortals are not bound by the Rules and are allowed to behead Immortals on Holy Ground; the Hunters (see below) do this to Darius in Highlander: The Series. A practical result of this rule is that Immortals use Holy Ground as a neutral territory on which they can meet each other without risking losing their heads. In Highlander, The Kurgan taunts Connor MacLeod in a church. When MacLeod becomes aggressive with the Kurgan, he says, "Holy Ground, Highlander! Remember what Ramirez taught you!" Immortals wishing to retire from the Game often chose to live on Holy Ground. In Highlander: Endgame, Immortal Kell disregards this rule and slaughters a group of Immortals that were hidden in stasis on Holy Ground called the Sanctuary. This caused some controversy among fans, which prompted the producers to eliminate the reference to the sanctuary being on Holy Ground. In Highlander: The Source, The Guardian attacks Reggie on Holy Ground, though there is no obvious attempt to kill and the fight is short, following which Duncan attacks Methos, exclaiming that he did not care that it was Holy Ground. He is, however, quickly stopped by another Immortal. In neither case was there a beheading.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The Gathering ===\u000aIn Highlander, Ramírez describes the Gathering to Connor MacLeod in this way: "When only a few of us are left, we will feel an irresistible pull towards a far away land, to fight for the Prize." The Gathering is the reunion of the last few Immortals left on Earth who then fight each other until only one is left; this last one wins the Prize. The time of the Gathering is not consistent throughout the movies and series. In Highlander, the Gathering happens in 1985, the "far away land" is America and Connor wins the Prize after ultimately defeating the Kurgan. In Highlander: The Series, set in 1992-1998, the Gathering is supposed to happen during the first season for continuity with the first film. In all subsequent Highlander: The Series seasons and Highlander movies and series, the Gathering has not happened yet and the Game continues. In Highlander: Endgame, the Gathering is said to be set in "a far off time" and it is not mentioned at all in Highlander: The Search for Vengeance.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The Prize ===\u000aThe very last Immortal still alive at the end of the Gathering wins the Prize. The nature of the Prize is "ultimate power and knowledge", according to the Season 1 promotional booklet of Highlander: The Series. In Highlander, when Connor MacLeod wins the Prize, he screams out, "I know everything! I am everything!" He later tells Brenda Wyatt, "I can love and have children, live and grow old," all previously unavailable to him because Immortals are sterile and cannot live anywhere for very long without raising suspicion. Ramírez tells him, "You are generations being born and dying. You are at one with all living things. Each man's thoughts and dreams are yours to know. You have power beyond imagination." The way in which the last Immortal uses the Prize depends on his personality. David Abramovitz, Creative Consultant on Highlander: The Series, explains, "Because there can be only one, at the end there will be only one. If that one is good, the world will see a golden age. If evil, the world will fall into anarchy." In Highlander II: The Quickening, Connor MacLeod has become mortal after the Gathering and uses his vast knowledge to help mankind to solve its environmental problems. Conversely, in the Highlander: The Series episode "The Gathering", at a time when the Gathering has not happened yet, Connor describes what would happen should an evil Immortal win the Prize, "The last one will have the power of all the Immortals who ever lived. Enough power to rule this planet forever. If someone like Slan Quince [an evil Immortal] is that last one, mankind will suffer an eternity of darkness, from which it will never recover." This makes the Game, as Producer Barry Rosen puts it, an "ultimate battle of good and evil".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Quickening ==\u000a\u000aWhen Immortals are beheaded, there is a powerful energy released from their bodies which is called a Quickening. Lead Highlander: The Series actor Adrian Paul explains, "The Quickening is the receiving of all the power and knowledge another immortal has obtained throughout his or her life. It is like the receiving of a sacrament or a massive orgasm." The producers describe it so: "The power of the Quickening is the equivalent to a major electrical storm hitting \u2014 windows explode, lights short circuit, it is almost as if the victorious Immortal is in the center of a lightning storm."\u000aThis energy is absorbed by the Immortal who did the beheading. Panzer explains that if "an Immortal is decapitated by something other than the sword of the Immortal he was fighting, (...) what we thought was, as long as an Immortal is present, he gets the Quickening." If an Immortal is beheaded and there is no Immortal nearby to receive the Quickening, for example if the beheader is a mortal, then the Quickening dissipates in the sky. Panzer says, "If there is no Immortal present, then the Quickening just goes to the Source." It is not known yet what the Source exactly is.\u000aWhen a good Immortal beheads an evil one, it rarely happens that the evil Quickening completely overwhelms the personality of the good Immortal, making him evil. This is a Dark Quickening. The converse can also happen; Darius is the only known example of a Light Quickening.\u000aAn Immortal knows when a Quickening happens nearby and he knows which Immortal is dead, as demonstrated by Duncan MacLeod in Highlander: The Series. He falls on his knees when his friend Lucas Desiree is beheaded by Howard Crowley, and he knows it is Lucas who died. However, when Duncan witnesses the quickening when Richie kills Kristov in "Testimony", he first suspected that it was Richie who had been killed.\u000aIn Highlander: The Series, the producers had to make the beheadings less violent and acceptable to television standards. Panzer explains, "In the movies, you know, we had a lot more license. But this being television in the early 1990s, we couldn't have a lot of body parts flying around. So, we tried to use something that created the idea that somebody got their head cut off, but that it was more like a jolt of light came out of the head, and the lightning flew around them. This, I suppose, was less violent than the movie version."\u000aConsequently, the Quickening scene in the pilot episode "The Gathering" is described in the script as follows: "We will call this shot for want of a better term, the Quickening Thrust. This will be one of our signature shots of the show. Perhaps it is a strobed, slow-motion shot. Perhaps there is particular glint to the sword as it slashes towards us on a POV shot, representing the coup de grâce which is about to be delivered. In any event what we will NOT see, is a decapitation. No head leaves the body, indeed no sword strikes the neck. Instead, we cut to: The Quickening is a blinding flash of blue light emanating from what was the bad guy and filling the screen and arcing into anything electrical nearby. Thus, street lamps, car headlights, windows, etc. are blown out."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aImmortals can be "found" in any time era and in any place around the world. They can be of any race, ethnicity, or gender (and as an unfortunate few find out, any age). For example, Amanda is a Norman female; Xavier St. Cloud, Carl Robinson, Heresh Clay and Luther are black; Annie Devlin and Sean Burns are Irish; May-Ling Shen, Jin Ke and Kiem Sun are Chinese. There are comparatively few female Immortals. Abramovitz explains, "You have to be realistic. Women survive in a warrior's game by being different kinds of warriors. (...) You can't expect a woman who is 5'4" and 130 pounds to survive in the same way. (...) So it's hard for me to understand, no matter how good she is with a blade, that a woman could take on a great athlete and survive." In the first three films, all Immortals depicted were male. Female Immortals were introduced in 1992 in the fifth episode of Highlander: The Series, "Free Fall."\u000aMany of them are foundlings, like Duncan MacLeod and Richie Ryan, but it is not known if all of them are. Connor MacLeod, for example, is never said to be one; in Highlander: Endgame, he is seen protecting his aged mother from being burned as a witch, though whether or not he might have been adopted is never addressed. The matter is not settled in the movies or series, but in the Highlander novels it is assumed that all Immortals are foundlings. For example, in White Silence Duncan MacLeod tells Danny O'Donal, "We're all foundlings." Baby Immortals are never shown on screen but there are accounts of them in Highlander: The Series. In "Family Tree", Ian MacLeod, Duncan's foster father, tells him, "When the midwife looked into your eyes, for it was you the peasant brought in, she cringed back in fear... and said you were a changeling... left by the forest demons... and we should cast you out for the dogs!" In "Avenging Angel", Alfred Cahill says of his stepfather, "he knew I was different the first time he set eyes on me."\u000aImmortals are raised in the societies to which they were born or adopted into and often retain their personality, customs and habits most of their life. Abramovitz explains, "Even if you are an Immortal, who you are as a child in many ways is who you become." Immortals grow up and age exactly like mortals, except that they do not have children. The wounds they get heal normally; Colin MacLeod, for example, carries a permanent diagonal scar on his face as a result of his head having been cleaved in two, causing his First Death. They do not feel the Buzz but they trigger a very faint Buzz in full-grown Immortals. Full-grown Immortals know what pre-Immortals really are when they encounter them.\u000aThere are a few Immortals that sometimes die during violent periods, such as wars, before they have the chance to grow up. These child Immortals are particularly vulnerable, as all the physical training in the world cannot put them on even terms with an adult Immortal, especially one-on-one. Expressing surprise that Immortals could be very young after meeting one, Richie Ryan is told by Duncan MacLeod that there is a reason so few exist: "he'll never be big enough or strong enough", or in other words, they will never be able to adequately protect themselves. Trapped in a small body for eternity, child Immortals tend to either become easy pickings, beheaded at an early time by evil Immortals, or if they live for more than a few decades become cold and calculating, using the only physical asset they have: the ability to feign childlike innocence. Years of surviving the Game replaces the innocent child with a scheming and often ruthless adult in a child's body, willing to prey upon the goodwill of good Immortals just as evil Immortals would have no qualms of preying upon the child. Duncan in particular has met child Immortals, and experience has taught him to not turn his back on the ones that have survived more than one lifetime. Duncan once warned Amanda about the child Immortal Kenny that she met again after 800 years, but she disregarded his advice, still considering Kenny to be as innocent as the newborn Immortal he was back then. She was deeply shocked and heart-broken when the experienced Kenny showed that he was now an adult, even as far as to express his sexual attraction for her.\u000a\u000a\u000a== First death ==\u000aAccording to Panzer, Immortals "carry within them the seed of their immortality which is triggered by a non-natural death." The movie Endgame establishes that without a violent first death to trigger their immortality, pre-immortals will age and die as other humans. According to the Watcher CD, "non-natural" and "violent" death are not due solely to weapons. Physical trauma (car crashes, falling off a cliff, runaway carts) can trigger immortality as well as being struck by lightning (Sharon Collins), burning (Angelina de Valincourt), hanging (Grace Chandel and Kenneth), poisoning (Caroline Mortimer, Carlo Sendaro, Mei-Ling Shen), and excessive alcohol consumption (Timon). Although death by disease is not "natural", caused by outside agents, and the symptoms before death can be physically traumatic, it is not listed as a trigger for immortality.\u000aDuncan MacLeod explains this to Felicia Martins in the Highlander: The Series episode "Free Fall"; he says, "It's only when we die that we become Immortal." They come back to life some time later, fully healed. This is called the First Death. Most Immortals feel their resurrection is a miracle. In "Avenging Angel", Duncan MacLeod comments, "That's what we all say... the first time."\u000aMortals usually react violently when they witness reviving from a First Death; Connor MacLeod was banished from his clan for witchcraft in 1536, which had become legendary in Duncan MacLeod's time 1592, which he recalls (likely referring to Connor), "When I was growing up there was a legend in my clan about a strange man in my grandfather's time. He was killed in battle and then miraculously revived.... I thought it was an old wives tale."\u000aNew Immortals are vulnerable because they do not know about the Game and they can get beheaded before they learn what they are. Immortal reactions to their first deaths vary - one character in the original Highlander TV series becomes excited and begins performing death defying stunts from the sheer thrill of knowing that he can't die. Nick Wolfe, from the spin-off series Highlander: The Raven, however, reacts angrily, not wanting to have become Immortal, knowing the dangerous lives they lead and regarding it more than anything else as a curse.\u000a\u000a\u000a== First Teacher ==\u000aThe new Immortal usually does not learn about their situation until they meet another Immortal willing to teach them. This Immortal is referred to as the First Teacher. The First Teacher teaches the new Immortal the Rules of the Game, how to use a sword and the tactics needed to win, as Juan Sánchez Villa-Lobos Ramírez did for Connor MacLeod and Connor MacLeod did for Duncan MacLeod. The First Teacher can become an important figure in an Immortal's life, as is Ramírez for Connor. Or it can be that teacher and student eventually have to fight each other, as in the case of Xavier St. Cloud who beheaded his First Teacher, Henri St. Cloud.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Physical characteristics ==\u000aAfter their First Death, Immortals can theoretically live forever, but in practice, it depends on their ability to defend their head against an opponent. Joe Dawson puts it so in his Chronicle about Alfred Cahill: "'Immortality' is a relative thing. A new Immortal has the chance to live for untold millennia - maybe even as long as the mythical Methos - or maybe all he gets is another week." Methos, the oldest living Immortal, is over 5000 years old, while Richie Ryan has been beheaded at the age of 22. They do not age any more and retain forever the appearance they had when they died for the first time. A First Death happening too early in life can be a hindrance at playing the Game; Kenny is an 800-year-old Immortal who died for the first time at the age of twelve and has retained the body of a 12-year-old ever since. Immortals are sterile and they have perfect dentition. While Immortals have only slightly more than normal human abilities in Highlander movies and series, in Highlander animated movies and series they have superhuman abilities such as enhanced speed and enormous strength.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The Buzz ===\u000aAfter their First Death, Immortals can feel the Buzz. Panzer defines the Buzz as "the concept of Immortals being able to sense each other's presence from a reasonable distance. We called it the Buzz. That word was never used, but that's how it was featured in the scripts." Indeed, the script of Highlander: The Series pilot episode "The Gathering" describes it as, "We hear something we will describe as the Highlander Buzz. Perhaps it is accompanied by a moving camera, an odd angle... something. Whatever it is, [Duncan] MacLeod suddenly senses it, strongly." The Buzz is something felt, not heard. In the above described scene, Duncan says that he feels something, although Tessa does not hear anything. Pre-Immortals do not feel the Buzz, but full-grown Immortals can sense and identify pre-Immortals in this way (though the Buzz is faint and easy to miss). Pre-Immortals start triggering the Buzz in full-grown Immortals when they are dying for the first time; a mortally wounded Alfred Cahill caused Duncan MacLeod a Buzz even before he was actually dead. Immortals who are not yet aware of the meaning of the Buzz often experience it as a headache, like Colin MacLeod, or migraine. Temporarily dead Immortals do not trigger a Buzz.\u000aThe Buzz is signalled by a brief sound effect in the movies and series. On Highlander: The Series, Buzz sounds were produced at the Post Modern Sound postproduction facility in Vancouver, British Columbia. Sound Supervisor Tony Gronick explains the Buzz as "a metal grinder that's affected so it jumps from left to right and has reverb on it," and a whoosh-like sound created by former Sound Effects Editor Mike Thomas. Former Sound Supervisor Vince Renaud says further, "The standard Buzz stays pretty much the same, then every once in a while they want something different for a Buzz." Sound effect variations on the Buzz include, according to Gronick, "Just getting a note of choir and then looping it, so it extends. Or we've taken the highs out of it and echoed it. Or one has an autopan on it, so we have it shifting from left to right."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Temporary death ===\u000aIn the first film, it was implied that Immortals could not die once shot or stabbed. as seen when in the flashback to 1944, Connor is shot by a Nazi officer but is still awake. In Highlander: The Series, Immortals have normal susceptibility to the things that are fatal to mortals and they will 'die' from them, only to resurrect shortly thereafter. However, Immortals often shrug off injuries that would likely kill normal human beings (theoretically because their bodies are so accustomed to pain), particularly in the movies (Connor surviving underwater without breathing, the Kurgan shrugging-off multiple assault rifle shots to the chest, Connor walking through fire in Highlander II: The Quickening, Duncan fighting through multiple stab wounds in Highlander: Endgame). Highlander: The Animated Series portrays Immortals as being extremely hearty and impervious to many causes of death (they clearly cannot drown), but can be harmed or killed by sufficient force beside beheadings. Immortals appear to be immune to disease, but they are susceptible to toxins and poisons. For example, Xavier St. Cloud uses poison gas to incapacitate his opponents. Bill Panzer said, "One of an Immortal's greatest fears is to be buried alive and probably unfound for thousands of years." In another episode of the series, Duncan encounters an Immortal whom he had a hand in marooning on a deserted island (the alternative being allowing the ignorant crew to behead him and exposing the Quickening). The immortal recounted the living nightmare that was; "Spending days starving to death, only to wake up and starve all over again."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Healing ===\u000aEvery wound an Immortal obtains quickly heals and disappears, except in the neck area, as seen in Immortals The Kurgan and Kalas. The healing is performed by a small Quickening flashing across the wound. An Immortal cannot regenerate or replace a limb or a major portion of the body when it is separated from the body. Panzer states about the Highlander: The Series episode "For Tomorrow We Die", in which Xavier St. Cloud's left hand is severed by Duncan MacLeod's blade, "We hold the question of what happens when an Immortal loses a body part other than his head. It does not grow back, does not regenerate." Creative Consultant David Abramowitz explains, "it posed a number of questions for us, as to whether a hand regenerates and we had decided that it didn't, even for Immortals. That they could heal, but they couldn't regenerate. (...) In truth, we, the writers, sat around the room for hours, talking about 'could we do this?', 'could we not do this?', and finally we decided to go for it." However, the separated portions can be reconnected to the body provided that the Immortal has the pieces together and is in the condition to perform the reconnection. In Highlander III: The Sorcerer Immortal Kane reconnects the upper and lower portions of his body after Connor MacLeod cut him in half during their final battle. This may, however, have been Kane demonstrating his powers of illusion, i.e., that he only looked like he'd been cut in half.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Other ===\u000aSome Immortals have different abilities such as the Guardian in The Source who has superhuman speed. The Japanese magician Nakano, the immortal mentor of Connor MacLeod from Highlander III: the Final Dimension, possesses the power of illusion. Immortal John Garrick has had clairvoyant powers since before his first death while Cassandra spent a thousand years refining her healing talent into a new skill: the power of hypnosis and suggestion, which she later passed onto her pupil Roland Kantos. In the T.V. series, Immortals are often seen drawing their weapons seemingly out of mid-air, even when there is obviously no way for the Immortal to conceal his or her weapon. This "power" is used sporadically, so its rules and limitations are ill-defined.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Way of life ==\u000aPanzer thinks that "for the most part, Immortals are very much like ordinary people," and most of them do the same things as mortals. "Some make a lot of money. Some become Terrorists like Annie Devlin who is an IRA terrorist leader. Some become policemen because they like to fight. Some become great lovers. Some like Duncan MacLeod become righters of wrongs. And some like Kuyler, (...) become the highest paid, most successful assassin there's ever been." Panzer and Abramowitz also reckon, "Most of the time, when we think about immortality, we think about the problems of immortality. The loneliness, the idea of losing loved ones over the centuries. The danger of being in conflict with other Immortals, (...) the solitude, the living a dark shadowy life. This show [Highlander: The Series, season 2, "Run For Your Life"] showcases how great it can be to be an immortal, how a man can, in three lifetimes, go from being a slave to being someone with hopes and dreams of becoming a professional baseball player, to finally someone who had hopes and dreams of actually changing the world."\u000aImmortals have much more time than mortals to mature their skills. Kuyler, mentioned above, lived for 354 years and killed 2760 people. Immortals usually try to blend in. Panzer says, "it's pretty much life in a shadowy world, making sure that after twenty years or twenty-five years you leave the place you are, change your identity, because you're not getting older and people are gonna start to notice." Connor MacLeod muses, "Do you think we ever lived like this, like a tribe, together with a common language, a reason and a name for each living thing? Did we once belong somewhere, a time, a place, however briefly?"\u000aIn the same way, relationships between Immortals are like those of mortals. Panzer explains, "they have Immortal friends that they like, they have Immortals that they don't like, except from time to time they fight. (...) And from time to time Immortals run into each other, after twenty years, fifty years or hundred years." Immortals can be friends, enemies, lovers, teachers, students or they can avoid their kind. The only difference is that they are supposed to play the Game, and trusting another Immortal can result in a severed head. "If it came down to us two, would you take my head?" asks Connor MacLeod to Ramirez, his mentor.\u000aImmortals rarely tell mortals about their immortality and even more rarely about the Game. Relationships between Immortals and mortals are difficult because while mortals grow old and die, Immortals remain the same and cannot have children. Mortals still chose sometimes to live with Immortals. Panzer recalls about the Highlander: The Series episode "The Sea Witch, "one of the issues of immortality that is intriguing is why does somebody chose to spend their mortal life with someone who won't grow old, and with whom they can't have children." In this episode Tessa Noël, Duncan MacLeod's lover, gets to know a little girl and becomes very fond of her. She says, "For a while there, just for a few hours... I felt like she was mine. I liked how it felt. But she's not... I have my own life and it's more than enough." Panzer comments, "It brings home in a very powerful way what exactly she's giving up to be with MacLeod." Immortals often come to despise mortals for their fragility. Abramovitz comments, "It's very easy for an Immortal to become cynical."\u000a\u000a\u000a== The Watchers ==\u000a\u000aThe Watchers are first introduced in the Highlander: The Series season 1 finale "The Hunters". They are a secret society founded centuries ago by some mortals who knew about Immortals and grew concerned about the winner of the Prize. Panzer says they have been "observing Immortals, recording their history but not interfering, for thousands of years." The Watchers have developed statistics about the potency of individual Immortals. Among the Watchers there is a small group of people called the Hunters. As Panzer states, "the Hunters have decided that Immortals are a bad thing, they are a scourge, they are a plague on the Earth, and they are unnatural and immoral and must be removed. And they have been killing Immortals." Their leader, James Horton, thinks that Immortals are "an abomination before nature and in the eyes of man," and claims that "There is no glory but ours. No destiny that is not of our making. (...) We will never be dominated. (...) We know about the Gathering. It's about power. There is nothing greater than the power of man."\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of Highlander characters\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

She grew up at Angono, Rizal and she spent her childhood liking different kinds of art. She developed her writing skills in high school and decided to take up journalism at University of Santo Tomas (UST) where she graduated. In 1993, she became the editor-in-chief of The Flame, UST Faculty of Arts and Letters' official student journal.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aAfter Aguinaldo graduated from college, she became a copywriter at an advertising firm. In 1996, she entered the broadcast industry and was the head writer of Usapang Business, a television program of ABS-CBN. After a year, she went to print media and became the senior report of The Manila Times.\u000aEventually, she worked for GMA Network as news reporter for 24 Oras and Saksi. She also hosted I-Witness, a television documentary program of GMA Network. She initially joined I-Witness in 2006 when Vicky Morales took a leave of absence and she was a temporary replacement but eventually, she became a regular of the show.\u000aWhen she started as a reporter for GMA Network, she was assigned to difficult reporting tasks such as the conflict in Mindanao, particularly in Jolo, Sulu, where she interviewed members of the Abu Sayyaf, Moro National Liberation Front and Moro Islamic Liberation Front; and she also covered the bombings in Israel. During the campaign of the Philippine presidential election in 2004 and before she was going to report for 24 Oras, she was berated by presidential candidate Fernando Poe, Jr. due to her presence at the stage. Two days after the incident, they were reconciled.\u000aIn I-Witness, she was able to produced different kinds of documentary including topics about poverty, which was questioned in 2012 when Aguinaldo and her co-hosts were at the "docufest" in Baguio. It was asked that "in continuing to feature stories of poverty, are documentaries a form of exploitation?". For Aguinaldo, when she makes documentary about poverty, she tries to give inspiration instead of making the poor people depressed. Her documentary entitled "Pasan-Pasan" is about children with disability who goes to school despite being handicapped. She also presented the documentary entitled "Iskul ko No. 1", which is about the Sindagan Elementary School, a school in Southern Leyte ranked top one in the 2006 National Achievement Test for graduating students.

aVTarn Hows is an area of the Lake District National Park, containing a picturesque tarn, approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) northeast of Coniston and about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) northwest of Hawkshead. It is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the area with over half a million visitors per year in the 1970s and is managed by the National Trust.\u000aTarn Hows is fed at its northern end by a series of valley and basin mires and is drained by Tom Gill which cascades down over several small waterfalls to Glen Mary bridge: named by John Ruskin who felt that Tom Gill required a more picturesque name and so gave the area the title 'Glen Mary'.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aThe Tarn Hows area originally contained three much smaller tarns, Low Tarn, Middle Tarn and High Tarn.\u000aWordsworth's Guide Through the District of the Lakes (1835 edition) recommends walkers to come this way but passes the tarns without mention.\u000aUntil 1862 much of the Tarn Hows area was part of the open common grazing of Hawkshead parish.

James Garth Marshall (1802\u20131873) who was the Member of Parliament for Leeds (1847\u20131852) and third son of the industrialist John Marshall, gained full possession of all of the land after an enclosure act of 1862 and embarked on a series of landscape improvements in the area including expanding the spruce, larch and pine plantations around the tarns; demolition of the Water Head Inn at Coniston; and the construction of a dam at Low Tarn that created the larger tarn that is there today.\u000aBy 1899 Tarn Hows was already an important beauty spot. H.S. Cowper mentions "Tarn Hows, beloved by skaters in winter and picnic parties in summer. Here comes every day at least one charabanc load of sightseers from Ambleside or Windermere". A wooden boat house that was still standing in the 1950s at the south east corner of the tarn probably dated from this period. In 1913 G.D. Abraham said "Tarn Hows is set wildly among larches and heather slopes, more like a highland lake than the other waters in Lakeland... more suitable for pedestrians than motorists".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Beatrix Potter ===\u000aIn 1930 the Marshall family wanted to sell their 4,000 acres (16 km2) Monk Coniston estate. Beatrix Potter's husband, William Heelis of Sawrey, was solicitor for the Marshall family and so was aware of the possibility early on. One of the farms within the estate had previously been owned by Potter's great grandfather and so Beatrix was interested in buying the estate as a whole rather than allowing it to be sold off piecemeal for tourist development; however, she could not afford the whole £15,000\u2013£18,000 asking price without selling other properties that she wanted to keep. Neither the National Trust nor the Forestry Commission could obtain the whole sum quickly enough and Potter's mother would not lend her the money. Potter wrote that 'Tarn Hows is such a favourite walk that on the face of it you might think it was a case for public subscription; but it would not work. My mother is known to be so wealthy that nobody would subscribe to help me!'\u000aPotter and Heelis negotiated to buy the whole estate for £15,000, relying on the National Trust to be able to appeal to the public to raise enough to buy back 2090 acres from her. During the period when Potter and Heelis owned the whole estate it was successfully managed by the two of them. The National Trust's appeal had raised nearly enough before the summer of 1930 and they bought most of the land from Potter \u2013 she donated the last part anonymously. When the Trust took over in September it asked Potter to carry on managing the land on its behalf. Bruce Thompson, the National Trust agent for its properties in the north of England, wrote in The Lake District and the National Trust in 1936 that "The Tarns and its setting were given to the nation by Sir S. H. Scott in 1930 as part of the Trust's general scheme for securing a large part of the Monk Coniston estate. The gift was made in memory of Sir James and Lady Scott." Presumably he donated the funds to the appeal to buy this portion of the estate. The remaining half of the Monk Coniston estate was bequeathed by Potter in her will to the National Trust.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== National Trust era ===\u000aTarn Hows was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1965.\u000aThe National Trust have made a number of more recent changes to the area including moving the car parks to a less obtrusive place in the 1960s and general footpath and road improvements to minimize the damage caused by the visitors. In May 2008 a building designed to harmonise with the landscape was opened, providing toilets and an information display under a sedum green roof.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Etymology ==\u000a" 'The hills by the pool(s)'; 'tj\u01ebrn/tarn', 'haugr/how(e).' There are five or six low hills, most of which form an intake. The pools, now amalgamated through damming, used to be separated by Tarn Moss and called 'The Tarns (High, Middle and Low Tarn)."'Tj\u01ebrn' and 'haugr' are ON (Old Norse), 'tarn' is dialect;\u000a\u000a\u000a== Gallery ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aWordsworth, W.

aVFrancis Xavier Caldwell (May 4, 1792 \u2013 June 5, 1851) was a businessman and political figure in Upper Canada.\u000aHe was born in Detroit in 1792, the son of William Caldwell and grandson of Jacques Baby. He served with the British Army during the War of 1812. After the war, he settled on a farm in Amherstburg. In 1831, he was appointed customs collector and, in 1833, justice of the peace. In 1834, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada for Essex; he was reelected in 1836. In 1835, he invested heavily in property near an ironworks in Essex County; the project failed due to the unstable financial climate and uncertainty related to the Upper Canada Rebellion. Caldwell also wound up assuming the financial responsibilities of another investor who fled to the United States. He had to sell much of his property to cover these debts.\u000aHe died in Malden Township in 1851.\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aBiography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online

aVBrian Dunkleman (born September 25, 1971) is an American comedian and actor. He is best known as being co-host with Ryan Seacrest on the first season of American Idol, in 2002.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== American Idol ===\u000aIn 2002 Dunkleman appeared as the co-host with Ryan Seacrest during the first season of American Idol. After the season ended, it was reported that Dunkleman had quit from co-hosting. Various news outlets later on said that he "had his career completely destroyed" for doing so, before it became enormously popular and made Seacrest very wealthy. However, one journalist believes that Dunkleman would have been fired had he not quit earlier, a fact numerous Idol staffers would eventually admit: Dunkleman had submitted his resignation shortly before news of his firing could reach him.\u000aDuring his 2008 appearance on the sixth season of the reality television weight loss show, Celebrity Fit Club on which he lost 15 pounds, and won the grand prize with his team, he spoke about his reasons for leaving American Idol following its first season. He stated his departure was due to the terrible way they treated the young contestants on the show, staging the fights between the judges and reshooting contestants with producer-provided glycerin tears in their eyes. He went on to say that leaving the show was a mistake. However, Ian K. Smith, one of the doctors on the panel, opined that he made the right decision.\u000aIn appearances on The Howard Stern Show, he had insisted that he intended to leave Idol to pursue a career in stand-up comedy and acting, but in 2008, Dunkleman admitted to Stern that he believed leaving the show was a mistake. Dunkleman conceded that he experienced several months of depression, and also still harbored resentment against current show host Ryan Seacrest, but has come to terms with his situation. Stern has compared Dunkleman to Pete Best of The Beatles and several other famous celebrities who chose to leave (or were forced to leave) successful show business careers, only to wind up as has-beens. In 2016, Dunkleman would backtrack and say that the mutual decision to part ways was not a mistake on his part.\u000aOn April 7, 2016, Dunkleman appeared on the American Idol fifteenth season and series finale. In an interview following the show, Dunkleman said "I think I beat them to the punch and I didn't know. I left the show but from what I gather, they weren't going to have me back anyway. So it's kind of a big load off my shoulders. I guess I didn't make a mistake. I didn't do a good enough job and I don't think I handled myself as professionally as I needed to back then."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Other work ===\u000aIn 2000 Dunkleman appeared in "The One With The Ring", a sixth season episode of Friends, as the man who buys the engagement ring Chandler wants to buy Monica.\u000aDunkleman has also appeared in pilots for ABC and 20th Century Fox and guest-starred on the late-night talk show Talkshow with Spike Feresten, Ghost Whisperer and Las Vegas. He had a recurring guest role on Two Guys and a Girl, played a stand-up comic suspected of murder in NYPD Blue, and appeared in an independent film called Comedy Hell.\u000aHis voice acting includes voicing himself in an episode of The Proud Family, in which the show parodied American Idol, did voices for the animated 3 South, and playing Ruiga in the English dub of the Japanese anime series Naruto.\u000aDunkleman was a co-host with Eric the Midget on The Idol Re-cap Show on Sirius\u2019s Howard 101. He also did voice over for the 1st season of American Idol Rewind.\u000aDunkleman played himself on an episode of My Name is Earl, hosting a reality contest show called Estrada or Nada, in which contestants show their skills in an America's Got Talent-esque show starring Erik Estrada. As Dunkleman ended a segment of the show he said, "Dunkleman... out. Hack stole it from me."\u000aDunkleman was also parodied in the series finale of Drawn Together. In the episode, he was shown as an out of work and unpopular drunk and his inner dialog expresses jealousy of Ryan Seacrest's last name, and his charisma.\u000aIn 2009 Dunkleman pitched a TV series about his life after American Idol entitled American Dunkleman. The series is a fictional account of the actor-comic's life, following the fictional Dunkleman as he tries to work his way back to the television industry, embarrassing himself and disappointing his friends while constantly being reminded that he "could have been a millionaire" had he stuck with Idol.\u000aHe does stand up regularly in Los Angeles at the Laugh Factory and The Improv, and he makes regular appearances as the host of Family Feud Live in Las Vegas and Atlantic City for Fremantle Media.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aDunkleman resided in Los Angeles until June 2016, when he returned to his childhood town of Ellicottville, New York. He is married and has one child, Jackson Dunkleman, four years old as of 2017.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aLos Angeles Times: The Return of Brian Dunkleman\u000aAOL News: Ex-Idol host Dunkleman pitches a comeback\u000aAnorak UK: American Idol Brian Dunkleman: The Man Who Turned Down Simon Cowell\u000aAOL Video: American Dunkleman\u000aLos Angeles Times: Neil Innes says, "Dunkleman for President!"\u000aAmerican Dunkleman website\u000aBrian Dunkleman on IMDb

aVFeatherston House is located at 22 The Boulevard, Ivanhoe, Victoria. It was designed by leading Australian architect Robin Boyd of Romberg & Boyd in 1967. The house was completed in 1969.\u000a\u000a\u000a== House design ==\u000aThe Featherston House is designed like an artist studio, and combines inspiration from a warehouse and loft. The house is famed for the design of its interior. Its interior comprises an indoor garden, combined with the suspension of four \u2018floating\u2019 platforms above the garden. The architect introduces natural light into the space by the construction of a transparent roof and large full glassed windows on one side of the house. The concept was to relook at how spaces could unfold and prevent compartmentalisation of the spaces.\u000aBoyd's home design was built for the couple Mary and Grant Featherston, who were industrial designers and a flat that was meant for the Featherston's parents. Boyd's works raised awareness for Australia's domestic buildings and suburbs in the 1960s and shows intentions of experimentation with ideas of affordable housing, raising the bar for aesthetics in suburbia housing for the general people.\u000aHis works are often seen as representational of International Modern Movement in Australia. Robin was an architect, teacher and writer and was well known in his field as an architect who pushes ideas and boundaries creatively.\u000aThe Featherston House sits on sloping ground, at the edge of a parkland in the suburbs. The Featherston, owners of the house were open to new ideas and Boyd had the creative freedom to design an alternative scheme, with the theme of living in a garden. The design approach was considered radical at that time with full glassed windows, overlooking the bush land, its garden at the ground floor and platforms that are placed strategically from the chimney, placed in the centre. The Featherston house took on the idea of a beautiful tree house. The owner describes her bedroom\u2014 \u201cwith its dizzying outlook from the highest of the four platforms \u2014 as a "nest.\u000aThe house brings in spaces from the outdoors and \u2018responses\u2019 to the natural environment. There is multi usage of a single space since the raised platform is used as a dancing area at parties. The raised platform also allows cool air in summer. The main exposition of this idea is a large 7.5m high space at the centre of the house. The idea of de compartmentalising is further developed by suspension of different living spaces on a series of four staggered, unframed platforms, forming the living, dining, study and master bedroom spaces.\u000aIn 1953, Boyd successfully achieved the vision of the combination of window and wall and launched The Stegbar 'Windowall' that year. The firm of Stegbar had been founded in Melbourne in 1946 by Brian Stegley (1920\u20131974) ('Steg-') and George Barrow ('-bar') with the intention of manufacturing clock cases and office furniture. In 1950 Stegbar made timber windows from their factory on the corner of Bay and Aberdeen Roads in Sandringham. Robin Boyd designed the Stegbar 'Windowall' system which revolutionised the firm's economic base. The overall appearance of the Stegbar 'Windowall' was light but the frames made of hardwood were resilient enough to hold any roof load. Individual framing members were continuous in both directions \u2013 unbroken mullions and transoms - intersecting each other in a copyright halved joint, alike a floor to ceiling window.\u000aThe roof is translucent cellular polycarbonate, allowing soft light to pass through and light up the space below at all times of the day. This is the third roof solution to be tried and the most successful. A wall of glass at the south elevation of the house lets additional light in and also provides views to the treed parkland beyond. The eastern wall hides the kitchen, family and guest bedrooms, located in their own zone, with the flat above. Meanwhile, the other service areas are placed behind the western wall. Some of the more interesting features of the Featherston House are Boyd\u2019s preference of Japanese design, incorporating natural air conditioning, adapted to the Australian\u2019s weather. The design includes three flaps built into the platform which can be utilised to draw air from a \u201ccool room" to ventilate the house.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Award ==\u000aRAIA Gold Medal 1969\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a Media related to Featherston House at Wikimedia Commons

aVThe 1995 Rugby League World Cup was held during October in the United Kingdom. It was the eleventh staging of the Rugby League World Cup and was marketed as the Halifax Centenary World Cup, reflecting the tournament's sponsorship and the fact that 1995 marked the 100th birthday of the sport. Envisaged as a celebration of rugby league football, the size of the competition was doubled, with four additional teams invited and Great Britain split into England and Wales (Scotland and Ireland took part in the Emerging Nations Tournament that was held alongside the World Cup.)\u000aThe tournament had been preceded by doubts and pessimism; many feared that it would produce one-sided-matches that would be unattractive to supporters. The forthcoming Super League war also hung over the tournament, with the Australian Rugby League refusing to select players who had signed for the rival competition.\u000aIn the event, the fears proved unfounded, and the tournament was acclaimed a great success. Although many early matches did prove as one-sided as feared, fans still flocked to see newer rugby league nations such as Fiji, Tonga, Western Samoa and South Africa. Large home crowds for the group involving Wales proved particularly encouraging for the sport.\u000aFor the 1995 tournament, a £10,000 cup was made by Tiffanys to celebrate the centenary of the game.\u000aThe final between Australia and England drew a crowd of 66,540 to Wembley Stadium. Australia won the tournament, their eighth World Cup win and fifth in succession.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Teams ==\u000a\u000aTen teams competed in the Centenary World Cup: Australia, England, Fiji, France, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Tonga, Wales and Western Samoa. It was the first time since the 1975 World Series that the Great Britain team was split into England and Wales. Fiji, South Africa, Tonga and Western Samoa were all making their World Cup débuts.\u000aA sore point for the tournaments organisers was that Australia was missing a large portion of their best players, a number of whom had been Kangaroo Tourists the previous year, due to the Super League war and the ARL's refusal to select Super League aligned players. Australia's win in the end with what many considered to be a second-string side was seen as a blow to the rebel Super League organisation, with which every other nation was aligned.\u000aIn light of the ARL's stance on not selecting players who had signed with Super League, Canberra Raiders players Laurie Daley, Ricky Stuart, Bradley Clyde, Steve Walters and Brett Mullins, won a court order against the ARL making SL players eligible for representative games. However, despite assurances from the ARL that all players were considered, it came as no surprise when only ARL loyal players made the Kangaroos World Cup squad. As one unnamed ARL official allegedly said, the court decision only forced the ARL to consider Super League players, they were not forced select them. As the list of players considered for the squad was never made public by the ARL it remains unknown how many, if any, SL players were actually considered for World Cup selection with rumours persisting that no SL player was actually given any consideration.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Venues ==\u000aThe games were played at various venues in England and Wales.\u000aWembley Stadium in London was the host stadium for the opening ceremony and match featuring hosts England and defending champions Australia. Wembley, England's national stadium, would also host the Final of the tournament.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Matches ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Group stage ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Group A ====\u000a\u000aThe tournament opened with a match between hosts England and current World Cup holders Australia at what was a half-full Wembley Stadium (the low crowd of just 41,271 was largely blamed on Australia not playing their Super League stars). It was a grey and showery day and Diana Ross provided pre-match entertainment. Australia were weakened by the absence of any player aligned with Super League, who the ARL refused to select. England were weakened by injuries, most notably that of star winger Martin Offiah.\u000a\u000aEngland led 10\u20136 early in the second half, with a try to Andy Farrell late in the first and one to replacement forward Chris Joynt 5 minutes into the second, both coming about through mistakes from Australia's fullback, Tim Brasher. A try to Mark Coyne levelled the score at 10\u201310. But England's Jason Robinson scored after another Australian handling error by winger John Hopoate with twelve minutes remaining. Another England try, this time from an interception by Paul Newlove put the result beyond doubt. This game attracted 4.2 million viewers.\u000a\u000aAs expected, rugby league minnows South Africa were the easybeats of Group A, but the Rhinos won plenty of fans with their never say die attitude despite being clearly outclassed by their opposition.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Group B ====\u000a\u000aTonga proved to be the surprise packets of Group B while New Zealand, although winning the group, were a disappointment. Tonga actually led the Kiwis 24\u221212 late in their pool game at Warrington, but two late tries and a Matthew Ridge field goal prevented one of the biggest boil overs in World Cup history.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Group C ====\u000a\u000aAs expected Wales, led by their inspirational dual-rugby international captain Jonathan Davies in his last appearance before retiring from international league, easily won Group C. The French however, twice a former World Cup Finalist in 1954 and 1968, were largely disappointing and did not win a match. The Graham Lowe coached Western Samoans, featuring a number of former New Zealand test players, entertained the Welsh fans with their bruising and enterprising style of play.\u000a\u000aThis match featured eight former and future Welsh rugby union internationals and two former All Blacks.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Knockout stage ===\u000a\u000aEngland as expected defeated reigning European Champions Wales in their Semi-final at Old Trafford. The other Semi at Huddersfield almost produced a boil over. After defeating New Zealand 3\u20130 in the Trans-Tasman Test series earlier in the year, and with the Kiwis lackluster form in their Group B games, Australia was expected to easily account for Frank Endacott's side, but the Kiwis found form and the game ended 20\u2013all at the end of 80 minutes. However, 20 minutes of extra time saw Australia skip away to a 30\u201320 win to book their place in the Final at Wembley.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Final ===\u000a\u000aThe Australians had reached the final after a hard fought 30\u201320 Semi-final win over New Zealand at the McAlpine Stadium which had gone into extra time after the score was locked at 20-all after 80 minutes. Their opponents and tournament host England, had an easier time defeating Wales 25\u201310 in their Semi at Old Trafford. Even though they were favoured to win, Australia went into the final having lost three of their past four games at Wembley (the only win being the World Cup final of 1992), and had already lost the opening match of the tournament there to the English. Also, due to the ARL's policy of not selecting Super League aligned players, the Kangaroos went into the game with 11 of their 17 players under the age of 24. Although considered mostly a 'second string' team without the likes of Laurie Daley, Ricky Stuart, Andrew Ettingshausen, Steve Renouf, Steve Walters and Glenn Lazarus, most of the Kangaroos had played in the 3\u20130 whitewash of New Zealand in the Trans-Tasman series earlier in the year. Kangaroos captain and five-eighth Brad Fittler and fullback Tim Brasher were the only members of Australia's 1992 World Cup Final win over Great Britain at Wembley, with both players in the same positions as they had been three years previously.\u000aEngland's captain Shaun Edwards ruled himself out of the final with an infected knee. Despite almost being ruled out of the tournament with pneumonia, St Helens centre Paul Newlove was selected by coach Phil Larder for starting line-up in the final. Larder also handed the captaincy to veteran test forward Denis Betts. With the former Wigan back rower now playing for the Auckland Warriors in the Australian premiership, his selection as captain created history as he became the first player to captain England while not currently playing in the British competition.\u000aAfter winning in 1992, Australian coach Bob Fulton became just the second coach (after Harry Bath) to win two Rugby League World Cup's. It was Fulton's 5th World Cup win after also winning in 1968, 1970 and 1975 as a player. Coincidentally, Fulton's coach in the 1968 and 1970 World Cup Finals was Harry Bath.\u000aStatus Quo performed the pre-match entertainment.\u000a\u000aFirst-half\u000aEngland won the coin toss and Australia's Andrew Johns kicked off the match. In England's first set with the ball Australia were penalised for their skipper Brad Fittler's high tackle on Andrew Farrell. From the resulting good field position England were able to force a line drop-out and get another set of six in Australia's half of the field. At the end of the set, Radlinski put up a high kick, which Australia's fullback Tim Brasher failed to secure and Australia were penalised for regathering the ball when off-side. Bobbie Goulding kicked the penalty goal from fifteen metres out, giving his side a 2 \u2013 0 lead. From Australia's resulting kick-off, the English players couldn't secure the ball and it was regathered by the Kangaroos deep in the opposition half. On the last tackle of the ensuing set, Johns at first receiver put a chip kick into the left-hand corner of England's in-goal area where winger Rod Wishart dived in and got a hand on it, giving Australia the first try of the match in the seventh minute. Johns then converted the try from the touch-line and the Kangaroos were leading 2 \u2013 6. A few minutes later England were penalised around the centre of the field and Johns attempted the kick at goal but missed. With the game now swinging from end to end, Johns conceded a penalty close to the goal posts and Goulding's kick bounced off the uprights but went in, so England were trailing 4 \u2013 6 by the eighteenth minute. A few minutes later England conceded a penalty in front of their goal posts and Johns kicked Australia to a 4 \u2013 8 lead. Shortly after that England winger Martin Offiah made a break down along the left sideline and was contentiously ruled to have been taken over the sideline by a desperate Tim Brasher tackle as he threw the ball back into the field for Paul Newlove to toe ahead and dive on, though television replays suggested that Offiah had managed to release the ball before he went into touch. After a high shot from Andy Farrell on Mark Carroll, Johns kicked another penalty giving Australia a 4 \u2013 10 lead at the thirty-minute mark. Just before the half-time break England conceded another penalty in the ruck but Johns' kick missed so the score remained unchanged at the break.\u000aSecond half\u000aAfter making their way into good attacking field position, England played the ball ten metres out from Australia's goal-line where centre Paul Newlove at dummy-half ran the ball at the defence forced his way through to score in the left corner. The sideline conversion attempt by Goulding missed so England trailed 8 \u2013 10 after five minutes of the second half. Around the ten-minute mark the game was interrupted by a topless female streaker. The play continued swinging from one end of the field to the other, with neither team able to capitalise on their scoring opportunities for the next twenty minutes. Australian interchange player Jason Smith was blood binned and had to return to the bench. A few minutes later the Kangaroos had made their way deep into England's half when, on the last tackle, the ball was moved through the hands and eventually flicked passed back from Johns as he was being tackled to the feet of Brasher who kicked it ahead to the try-line. Both fullbacks then scrambled to get to the ball and the referee ruled that Brasher had grounded it, awarding Australia a try. Johns converted the try so Australia lead 8 \u2013 16 with just over ten minutes remaining. England forward Karl Harrison then had to come off the field with an injured arm. A few minutes from full-time Australian forward Mark Carroll was sent to the sin-bin for an infringement in the ruck. The remainder of the match extended into additional injury time but was played with no further points so Australia retained the World Cup with an 8 \u2013 16 victory and their fifth consecutive world title.\u000a21-year-old Andrew Johns was named man-of-the-match. Kangaroos coach Bob Fulton had named the young half as the team hooker, and he did indeed pack into the scrums. However Johns played at halfback in general play with Geoff Toovey having the dummy-half duties, necessary because Toovey had actually injured his neck during the tournament and simply could not pack into the front row in the scrums.\u000aFollowing the match Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex presented Kangaroos captain Brad Fittler with the Cup and each of the players with medals. During the 1990 Kangaroo Tour, an 18-year-old Fittler had reportedly broken protocol when he had said "G'day dude" to Prince Edward's father, HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh when the team had met the Duke as part of the tour. History allegedly repeated itself as Fittler was heard to say "Thanks dude" to Prince Edward when receiving the World Cup on the Wembley balcony.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Team of the tournament ==\u000aThe following players were selected as the 1995 World Cup "Team of the Tournament"\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a1995 World Cup audio highlights\u000a1995 World Cup Final at rlphotos.com\u000a1995 World Cup data at hunterlink.net.au\u000a1995 World Cup at rlif.com\u000a1995 World Cup at rlhalloffame.org.uk\u000a1995 World Cup at rugbyleagueproject.com\u000a1995 World Cup at 188-rugby-league.co.uk

aVSeamus Anthony Close OBE (born 12 August 1947) is a Northern Irish politician, former member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for Lagan Valley and a former deputy leader of the Alliance Party.\u000aIn August 1981 he was the Alliance candidate for the second Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election. The following year under the redistribution and expansion of Northern Ireland's constituencies his local political base became part of the new Lagan Valley constituency which he has contested in the Alliance interest in all elections since 1983 apart from the 1986 by-election called in protest against the Anglo-Irish Agreement when the local Alliance branch declined to contest the seat as they believed the by-election was a political stunt.\u000aClose also held several positions in the Alliance, including serving as Chair between 1981 and 1982 and as Deputy Leader from 1991 until 2001. He was often a member of the key Alliance delegations in successive talks about the future of the province, culminating in the Belfast Agreement of 1998.\u000aIn the 1996 elections for the Northern Ireland Forum Close stood at the head of the Alliance's list for Lagan Valley but the party failed to secure enough votes to win one of the local seats. Close was also included on the province-wide list and as the most senior Alliance member to not be elected locally he won one of Alliance's two seats. In the 1998 election for the new Northern Ireland Assembly he topped the poll in Lagan Valley and gained a further personal triumph in the 2001 general election when he had the highest vote share of any Alliance candidate.\u000aIn June 2001 he resigned as Deputy Leader of the party, citing differences with the leadership of Seán Neeson. Close has remained a member of the Assembly and successfully held his seat in the 2003 Assembly election.\u000aIn July 2005, Mr Close proposed that the Lisburn Council deny gay couples access to the council's designated wedding facility if they were seeking a civil partnership under the Civil Partnership Act 2004. The council adopted his recommendation to the great annoyance of many liberal campaigners. This ran against Alliance policy, which had been strongly supportive of the introduction of civil partnership laws, and he was publicly criticised by other senior party members.\u000aIn November 2006, Close announced that he was retiring from politics In the 2007 election he was succeeded as Alliance Party Lagan Valley Assembly representative by current Mayor of Lisburn, Councillor Trevor Lunn.\u000aClose was succeeded as Mayor of Lisburn by Harry Lewis\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVInverse probability weighting is a statistical technique for calculating statistics standardized to a population different from that in which the data was collected. Study designs with a disparate sampling population and population of target inference (target population) are common in application. There may be prohibitive factors barring researchers from directly sampling from the target population such as cost, time, or ethical concerns. A solution to this problem is to use an alternate design strategy, e.g. stratified sampling. Weighting, when correctly applied, can potentially improve the efficiency and reduce the bias of unweighted estimators.\u000aOne very early weighted estimator is the Horvitz\u2013Thompson estimator of the mean. When the sampling probability is known, from which the sampling population is drawn from the target population, then the inverse of this probability is used to weight the observations. This approach has been generalized to many aspects of statistics under various frameworks. In particular, there are weighted likelihoods, weighted estimating equations, and weighted probability densities from which a majority of statistics are derived. These applications codified the theory of other statistics and estimators such as marginal structural models, the standardized mortality ratio, and the EM algorithm for coarsened or aggregate data.\u000aInverse probability weighting is also used to account for missing data when subjects with missing data cannot be included in the primary analysis. With an estimate of the sampling probability, or the probability that the factor would be measured in another measurement, inverse probability weighting can be used to inflate the weight for subjects who are under-represented due to a large degree of missing data.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Inverse Probability Weighted Estimator (IPWE) ==\u000aThe inverse probability weighting estimator can be used to demonstrate causality when the researcher cannot conduct a controlled experiment but has observed data to model. Because it is assumed that the treatment is not randomly assigned, the goal is to estimate the counterfactual or potential outcome if all subjects in population were assigned either treatment.\u000aSuppose observed data are \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        {\u000a        \u000a          \u000a            (\u000a          \u000a        \u000a        \u000a          X\u000a          \u000a            i\u000a          \u000a        \u000a        ,\u000a        \u000a          A\u000a          \u000a            i\u000a          \u000a        \u000a        ,\u000a        \u000a          Y\u000a          \u000a            i\u000a          \u000a        \u000a        \u000a          \u000a            )\u000a          \u000a        \u000a        \u000a          }\u000a          \u000a            i\u000a            =\u000a            1\u000a          \u000a          \u000a            n\u000a          \u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005c{{\u005cbigl (}X_{i},A_{i},Y_{i}{\u005cbigr )}\u005c}_{i=1}^{n}}\u000a   drawn i.i.d from unknown distribution P, where\u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        X\u000a        \u2208\u000a        \u000a          \u000a            R\u000a          \u000a          \u000a            p\u000a          \u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle X\u005cin \u005cmathbb {R} ^{p}}\u000a   covariates\u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        A\u000a        \u2208\u000a        {\u000a        0\u000a        ,\u000a        1\u000a        }\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle A\u005cin \u005c{0,1\u005c}}\u000a  \u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        Y\u000a        \u2208\u000a        \u000a          R\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle Y\u005cin \u005cmathbb {R} }\u000a   response\u000aWe do not assume treatment randomly assigned completely at random\u000aThe goal is to estimate the potential outcome, \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Y\u000a          \u000a            \u2217\u000a          \u000a        \u000a        \u000a          \u000a            (\u000a          \u000a        \u000a        a\u000a        \u000a          \u000a            )\u000a          \u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle Y^{*}{\u005cbigl (}a{\u005cbigr )}}\u000a  , that would be observed if the subject were assigned treatment a.

Limitations ====\u000aThe Inverse Probability Weighted Estimator (IPWE) can be unstable if estimated propensities are small. If the probability of either treatment assignment is small, then the logistic regression model can become unstable around the tails causing the IPWE to also be less stable.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Augmented Inverse Probability Weighted Estimator (AIPWE) ==\u000aAn alternative estimator is the augmented inverse probability weighted estimator (AIPWE) combines both the properties of the regression based estimator and the inverse probability weighted estimator. It is therefore a 'doubly robust' method in that it only requires either the propensity or outcome model to be correctly specified but not both. This method augments the IPWE to reduce variability and improve estimate efficiency. This model holds the same assumptions as the Inverse Probability Weighted Estimator (IPWE).\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Estimator Formula ===\u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a

aVThe lasing threshold is the lowest excitation level at which a laser's output is dominated by stimulated emission rather than by spontaneous emission. Below the threshold, the laser's output power rises slowly with increasing excitation. Above threshold, the slope of power vs. excitation is orders of magnitude greater. The linewidth of the laser's emission also becomes orders of magnitude smaller above the threshold than it is below. Above the threshold, the laser is said to be lasing. The term "lasing" is a back formation from "laser," which is an acronym, not an agent noun.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Theory ==\u000aThe lasing threshold is reached when the optical gain of the laser medium is exactly balanced by the sum of all the losses experienced by light in one round trip of the laser's optical cavity.

This equation separates the losses in a laser into localised losses due to the mirrors, over which the experimenter has control, and distributed losses such as absorption and scattering.

However, this is not an assumption which can ever be fully satisfied. The problem is that the laser output power varies by orders of magnitude depending on whether the laser is above or below threshold. When very close to threshold, the smallest perturbation is able to cause huge swings in the output laser power. The formalism can, however, be used to obtain good measurements of the internal losses of the laser as follows:\u000aMost types of laser use one mirror that is highly reflecting, and another (called the output coupler) that is partially reflective. Reflectivities greater than 99.5% are routinely achieved in dielectric mirrors. The analysis can be simplified by taking \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          R\u000a          \u000a            1\u000a          \u000a        \u000a        =\u000a        1\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle R_{1}=1}\u000a  . The reflectivity of the output coupler can then be denoted \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          R\u000a          \u000a            OC\u000a          \u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle R_{\u005ctext{OC}}}\u000a  .

aVThe Locus 7 Site is an archaeological site in Washington Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, United States. Located north of Fayette City, the site lies on a bluff over Downers Run about 2,000 feet (610 m) from the Monongahela River. It is believed to be the location of a former Monongahela village, but its date is uncertain; the village may have existed at any time between 900 and 1600. Its location on a bluff is unusual for Monongahela village sites, but this may have contributed to its preservation; most riverside Monongahela sites in the valley of the Monongahela River have been destroyed by development.\u000aSmall-scale archaeological investigation at the site has revealed a wide range of pottery at the site, along with a significant amount of mussel shells; it is believed that a more extensive excavation would yield evidence of small round houses and a stockade. Such a large amount of potential findings has been theorized because of the limited disturbance that the site has seen: unlike most Monongahela sites in the region, it has been damaged only by surface cultivation by local farmers who used only horse-powered equipment.\u000aLocus 7's archaeological significance was recognized in 1980 when it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of Native American archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a^ a: While the source for this statement gives the name as "Douners Run," the United States Geological Survey has recorded the stream's name as given in the text.^ b: While the source for this statement states that the site lies west of the river, this is impossible, as the land west of the river is part of Washington County.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aMichael, Ronald L.

aVDendroarchaeology is a term used for the study of vegetation remains, old buildings, artifacts, furniture, art and musical instruments using the techniques of dendrochronology (tree-ring dating). It refers to dendrochronological research of wood from the past regardless of its current physical context (in or above the soil). This form of dating is the most accurate and precise absolute dating method available to archaeologists, as the last ring that grew is the first year the tree could have been incorporated into an archaeological structure.\u000aTree-ring dating is useful in that it can contribute to "chronometric", "environmental", and "behavioral" archaeological research.\u000aThe utility of tree-ring dating in an environmental sense is the most applicable of the three in today's world. Tree rings can be used to "reconstruct numerous environmental variables" such as "temperature", "precipitation", "stream flow", "drought society", "fire frequency and intensity", "insect infestation", "atmospheric circulation patterns", among others.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aTree ring laboratory scientists from Columbia University were some of the first to apply tree-ring dating to the colonial period, specifically architectural timbers in the eastern United States. For agencies like the National Park Service and other historical societies, Dr. Jacoby and Cook began dating historic structures in the lower Hudson River Valley, New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania. This was difficult at the time due to a lack of sufficiently long master dating chronology and access to suitable structures. Not until 1998 was a Boston area master dating chronology developed. Today, the effectiveness of tree ring laboratory archaeological dating chronologies covers most of the area that was settled by the first European colonists. The numbers of these are in the hundreds and include historically significant structures such as Independence Hall and the Tuckahoe estate.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Methodology ==\u000aThere are two types of dates that can be assigned to tree specimens: cutting dates, and noncutting dates. Which date is assigned to a specimen is dependent on whether or not there is evidence that the last ring present on the specimen was the last ring the tree grew before it died.\u000aCutting dates can be used for crossdated tree specimens that "possess evidence that the last ring present on the specimen was the last ring grown by the tree before it died." \u000aNoncutting dates are used for crossdated tree specimens "if there is no evidence indicating that the last ring present on the specimen is the last one grown before the tree died."  Patterns of tree growth will be similar between trees of the same species, growing in the same climate. These matching patterns align growth rings in different trees formed in the same year. Once aligned, knowing the precise calendar year of any individual tree-ring is the same as knowing the calendar year of all the rings. The goal of a dendroarchaeologist is to determine the year when the last ring was formed. Crossdating, the skill of finding matching ring-width patterns between tree-ring samples, is used to assign the precise calendar year to every ring. This is affected by the climate that the timber was in. It is also important to have enough rings to actually confirm a date. Once the rings are dates, the chronology is measured. The last step is to compare the rings with that of ring-width patterns in sampled timbers and a master dating chronology.\u000aFor trees to be useful in archaeological analysis, they must "produce annual growth rings that are uniform around the tree stem", they must "live for decades and, preferably, centuries" and they "must have been used extensively by humans either for habitation or fuel."  One of the problems with this evaluation is that it is possible under certain conditions for a tree to miss a growth-ring or produce two growth rings in a season. During extreme drought there can be insufficient growth of xylem to form a noticeable ring. Alternatively, if a defoliating agent (e.g. drought, late frost, or insect damage) can arrest the growth of a tree early in a year, after which there is a secondary growth period of new foliage causing two rings to form. Another difficulty in the use of tree-ring dating as applied to archaeology is the variety and condition of wood used in construction of archaeological sites. Many such samples are encountered wet. Heartwood can normally retain much of its substance and can be dried out and polished for analysis. On the other hand, ancient wet sapwood samples seldom survive drying out. As a result, the sapwood should either be measured wet and then allowed to dry, or it should be frozen or kept wet.\u000aIn North America, "millennial-length chronologies have been developed for two species of bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva in the Great Basin and Pinus aristata in the Rocky Mountains), bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), eastern cedar (Juniperus virginiana), juniper (Juniperus sp.), Larch (Larix sp.), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), limber pine (Pinus flexilis), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) (Jacoby, 2000a).\u201d \u000a\u201cIn the southern hemisphere, successful crossdating has been achieved on alerce (Fitroya cupressoides) and pehuen (Araucaria araucana), also known as 'Chilean pine' or the 'monkey puzzle tree,' specimens in South America, kauri (Agathis australis) specimens in New Zealand, clanwilliam cedar (Widdringtonia cedarbergensis) specimens in Australia and Tasmania, and huon pine (Lagarostrobus franklinii) in Tasmania (Jacoby, 2000al; Norton, 1990).\u201d \u000a\u000a\u000a== Application ==\u000aThe main application of tree research laboratory science or dendroarchaeology is to produce records of past climates that might be unavailable otherwise. Timber remains give insight into what little remains of our national forests prior to colonial settlement. This also benefits the sciences of paleoclimatology.\u000aDendrochronological dating is potentially applicable wherever trees were growing, except in tropical regions. For use in absolute dating of archaeological sites, it is partially limited by the availability of a master reference chronology for the region concerned. If there is a gap in the chronology (e.g. the inability to use a chronology constructed from pine samples in the British Isle prior to the 17th century due to the lack of use of pine in architecture then) then absolute dating cannot be applied. Additionally, non-climatic influences can also affect the tree-ring pattern of timber samples. Even if a reference chronology is available, care must be taken to identify aberrations in the ring pattern to determine if the sample is usable for dating.\u000aDendroarchaeology has been used extensively in the dating of historical buildings. After cross-matching the chronology from the building with the chronology of living trees, it is immediately possible to figure out the dates at which the historic timbers used in construction were felled. Similarly, if an extended chronology is available, then dating of samples from buildings of known or unknown date is possible. However, a limiting aspect of this application becomes apparent when dating medieval buildings. In such buildings, many timber samples lack completeness out to the underbark surface which can make the task of determining the felling year much more difficult.\u000aThe application of dendroarchaeology in uncovering past trade patterns also becomes possible as chronology records for timber around the world become more complete and accessible. Patterns from individual samples will match much more closely with their native chronologies than with their regional chronology. For example, strong cross dating is found between Irish and English chronologies, but individual ring patterns tend to match better against their local chronologies. Hence, this strong geographical component of tree ring chronologies can be used to source timber samples at archaeological sites to uncover trade routes required for the site construction.\u000aDendrochronology can also be used in concert with radiocarbon dating to allow for more accurate date measurements using radiocarbon dating on archaeological sites. It is known that the concentration of carbon-14 in the atmosphere is not constant. By performing radiocarbon dating on timber samples in a known chronology, radiocarbon dates can be plotted against real time generating a calibration curve that can be used for future radiocarbon samples.\u000aWhile dendrochronology is often considered as an absolute dating method, it can also be used as a powerful tool in the relative dating of an archaeological site. Timber samples may be able to be compared with others on the site to help construct a timeline of events for that particular site. Such samples can also be used to settle issues in constructing a chronological typology for artifacts found on site. The important point is that such within-site analysis can be done whether or not a chronology is available to date the whole assemblage.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aArchaeology\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVWindows in the West is a 1993 watercolour painting by the Scottish artist Avril Paton. The painting was bought by the city of Glasgow for the Glasgow Gallery of Modern Art, and is currently on display at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description ==\u000a\u000aThe painting depicts the external profile of a 4-storey yellow sandstone tenement building during winter; the residents of the building can be seen doing various activities, with a mother and child, a man at a computer, and someone pulling aside curtains to look out at the snow outside. Paton depicted herself standing outside the door of the building in the painting, and later found out that a cat she thought she had seen was actually made from china. The painting is painted in gouache, egg tempera and watercolour, measures 5 x 4ft and took six months to complete.\u000aThe Scotsman newspaper wrote of Windows in the West in 2005 that "There was something cosily familiar about the painting's cheery, glowing character, the snow-covered roof and the warm yellow stone, the embracing perspective. ...It carries a nostalgic, storybook charm; Katie Morag in Glasgow's West End".\u000aThe building depicted in the painting is located at 35 Saltoun Street on the corner of Roxburgh Street in the Dowanhill district in Glasgow's West End, and is a Category B listed building. It was built in 1897.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aPaton was living as a caretaker of a top floor flat opposite the building on Saltoun Street on 11 January 1993, when at 5.30 pm, during a heavy blizzard, she saw 35 Saltoun Street "transformed" with a "lilac pink sky, lighted windows, clarity of whiteness, lots of people at home" according to Melanie Reid who interviewed Paton in 2005 for The Scottish Herald. The preliminary drawings for the paintings were completed in February and Windows in the West was finally finished in June. Paton had not set out to create such a large work, originally intending to paint the architectural detail of the building's drum windows. Paton said in 2005 that she had "realised I had made a mistake with the size of the paper. At that time I was terribly poor...Buying art materials was difficult. I was upset that the paper was the wrong size", but was galvanised to finish the work by her son who said "Oh it would be great if you could pull it off!"\u000aIt was originally planned to show the painting at Anne Mendelow's Gatehouse Gallery at Glasgow's Rouken Glen Park but Mendelow proposed that it was loaned to Glasgow Royal Concert Hall in the intervening period as it was taking up so much space in Paton's flat. The popularity of Windows in the West at the Royal Concert Hall bought it to the attention of the director of Glasgow's museums, Julian Spalding, who purchased it for the city in 1996. Spalding subsequently said that "What it caught was that moment when it was nearly dark, but people haven't drawn the curtains yet, and you can walk along the street and look into windows, and there's the light inside, and the light outside. People are going about their business in a private way; at the same time they have not yet hidden their private world. There is the balance between the inner life and the outer life that is just beautifully caught". Paton's 1988 painting The Barras had previously been bought by Glasgow Art Galleries and Museums and as her major sale it had established her as an artist.\u000aPaton subsequently described the residents as having been "thrilled to be in the painting...That building was a community in itself. They were colourful characters, who were always having parties". Paton has described her surprise at the popularity of the work, saying in a 2005 interview that "I find that quite amazing, because I don't understand it at all. I wasn't aware that it was going to be anything other than just another painting for an exhibition. I lived there for four to six years before I started the painting. I used to look at that building continually and enjoy it. I enjoyed seeing what people were doing. I would stand in the window, drink a cup of tea. Once it was painted, I never looked at it again".\u000aIn a May 2007 article for the Glasgow Evening Times, Shelia Hamilton interviewed residents of the building depicted in Windows in the West who recalled their memories of Paton and the effect of the painting on their lives. Hamilton wrote that "Maybe the day will come when there's a plaque on the wall...and we get guided tours. But for now, all most of us can do is wander along the street just round the corner from the Byres Road and have a quick peek as we pass by and wonder what it's like to live inside a painting" and described the building as "probably the most famous tenement in the world". Hamilton attributed the paintings appeal to the fact that "...they are real people living real lives and the reason why this picture has such a hold on the public's imagination. Outside, it may be icy in the painting but inside the rooms they are cocooned forever in safety and warmth". Paton said in a 2005 interview that "I haven't distanced myself from it; the picture has distanced itself from me. It's like a child. It goes off and leads its own life".\u000aPaton has sold almost 30,000 prints and 100,000 cards of reproductions of the painting; in 2005 it was the top selling print in Glasgow's Gallery of Modern Art shop.\u000aWindows in the West featured in a 2005 poll by the Glasgow Herald newspaper to find Scotland's favourite painting, and as a result of which subsequently inspired a poem by the Poet Laureate of Scotland, Edwin Morgan.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aAvril Paton discussing Windows in the West

aVManuel María Fernández Teixeiro, better known as Manuel María (October 6, 1929, Outeiro de Rei\u2013September 8, 2004, A Coruña), was a Spanish poet and academic who wrote in the Galician language. He was notable for his combative character and his political commitment. His poetry touched on themes of love, art, his own political commitment, drawing attention to wrongs, ethnography, physics, history, immateriality, mythology, the animal world, poetic expression, the passing of time, religion, society, language, agricultural labour, urbanism, and geography. The Day of Galician Literature was devoted to him in 2016.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aManuel María was the son of two well-to-do farmers, Antonio Fernández Núñez, who was the mayor of Outeiro de Rei, and Pastora Teixeiro Casanova. He went to primary school in his small village of Rábade. In 1942 he moved to Lugo to carry out his secondary studies at the Marist Brothers school. In Lugo, at the age of 20, he began his precocious literary career participating in a conference circuit called "Jóvenes valores lucenses." This helped him get in touch with members of a group that met at the Méndez Núñez cafeteria: Luís Pimentel, Ánxel Fole, Juan Rof Codina, Aquilino Iglesia Alvariño, and others. This was his introduction to Galicianism and the Galician literary world. His friendship with Uxío Novoneyra also dates from this period.\u000aIn 1950 he published his first collection of poems, Muiñeiro de brétemas ("Miller of mists"), which inaugurated the so-called "Escola da Tebra" (School of Shadows). His disappointment after failing the entrance exams to the University of Santiago inspired his second collection of poems, Morrendo a cada intre ("Dying every minute"). He did his military service in Santiago de Compostela and there he attended a gathering at Café Español, where he became a great friend of Carlos Maside. He then returned to Lugo, where he studied to become an attorney. In 1954 he won a prize at the Xogos Florais (Floral Games) in Ourense. In 1958 he became a court attorney in Monforte de Lemos, where he remained most of the rest of his life. To that city he dedicated a collection of poems, Cancioneiro de Monforte de Lemos. The following year he married Saleta Goi García in Lugo.\u000a\u000aAlthough poetry was his preferred medium, Manuel María also attempted essays, narratives and plays. He moved away from a pessimistic existentialist position towards social and political commitment. In the troubled period of the 1960s and 1970s, he took part in the undercover reorganisation of the Galician nationalist political parties; he also worked with various organisations devoted to restoring Galician culture, arranging conferences and reciting poems.

aVMerfyn Frych ('Merfyn the Freckled'; Old Welsh Mermin), also known as Merfyn ap Gwriad ('Merfyn son of Gwriad') and Merfyn Camwri ('Merfyn the Oppressor'), was King of Gwynedd from around 825 to 844, the first of its kings known not to have descended from the male line of Cunedda.\u000aLittle is known of his reign, and his primary notability is as the father of Rhodri the Great and founder of his dynasty, which was sometimes called the Merfynion after him. Merfyn came to the throne in the aftermath of a bloody dynastic struggle between two rivals named Cynan and Hywel \u2013 generally identified with the sons of Rhodri Molwynog, despite that putting both men well into their 70s or 80s at the time \u2013 at a time when the kingdom had been under pressure from Mercia.\u000aThe Annales Cambriae say Merfyn died around 844, the same year in which a battle occurred at Cetyll, but it is unclear whether those were two unrelated events or he fell in battle.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Political background ==\u000a\u000aThe times leading up to Merfyn's reign were unsettled for both Gwynedd and neighboring Powys. Both kingdoms were beset by internal dynastic strife, external pressure from Mercia, and bad luck with nature. In 810, there was a bovine plague that killed many cattle (the primary form of wealth at the time) throughout Wales. The next year, the ancient wooden llys at Deganwy was struck by lightning. A destructive war for control of Gwynedd raged between 812 and 816, while in Powys a son of the king was killed by his brother "through treachery". In 818, there was a notable battle at Llanfaes on Anglesey. Although our sources do not identify the combatants, the site had been the llys of King Cynan.\u000aCoenwulf of Mercia took advantage of the situation in 817, occupying Rhufoniog (see map) and laying waste to the mountains of Snowdonia. Coastal Wales along the Dee Estuary must have remained under Mercia through 821, as Coenwulf is recorded dying peacefully at Basingwerk in that year. In 823, Mercia laid waste to Powys and returned to Gwynedd to burn Deganwy to the ground. Gwynedd and Powys then gained a respite when Mercia's attention turned elsewhere and its fortunes waned. King Beornwulf was killed fighting the East Anglians in 826, his successor Ludeca suffered the same fate the following year, and Mercia was conquered and occupied by Ecgberht of Wessex in 829. Though Mercia managed to throw off Ecgberht's rule in 830, it was thereafter beset by dynastic strife and never regained its former dominance, either in Wales or eastern England.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Family background and marriage ==\u000a\u000aMerfyn was linked to the earlier dynasty through his mother Esyllt, the daughter of King Cynan (d. after 816), rather than through his father Gwriad ap Elidyr. As his father's origins are obscure, so is the basis of his claim to the throne.\u000aExtremely little is known of Merfyn's father Gwriad. Merfyn claimed descent from Llywarch Hen through him, and the royal pedigree in Jesus College MS. 20 says that Gwriad was the son of Elidyr, who bears the same name as his ancestor, the father of Llywarch Hen, Elidyr lydanwyn. Supporting the veracity of the pedigree is an entry in the Annales Cambriae, which states that Gwriad, the brother of Rhodri the Great, was slain on Anglesey by the Saxons. That is to say, Merfyn named one of his sons after his father Gwriad.\u000aThe discovery of a cross inscribed Crux Guriat (English: Cross of Gwriad) on the Isle of Man and dated to the 8th or 9th century raised the question of whether Gwriad's possible connection to "Manaw" was to Manaw Gododdin, once active in North Britain, or to the Isle of Man (Welsh: Ynys Manaw). John Rhys suggested that Gwriad might well have taken refuge on the Isle of Man during the bloody dynastic struggle between Cynan and Hywel prior to Merfyn's accession to the throne, and that the cross perhaps does refer to the refugee Gwriad, father of Merfyn. He goes on to note that the Welsh Triads mention a 'Gwryat son of Gwryan in the North'. Other locations for "Manaw" have been suggested, including Ireland, Galloway and Powys.\u000aWhile Rhys' suggestion is not implausible, his reference to Gwriad's father Gwrian contradicts the royal pedigree, which says that Gwriad's father was Elidir, so this may be a confusion of two different people named Gwriad. Gwriad's name does appear with northern origins in the Welsh Triads as one of the "Three kings, who were of the sons of strangers" (sometimes referred to as the "Three Peasant Kings"), where he is identified as the son of "Gwrian in the North".\u000aMerfyn allied his own royal family with that of Powys by marrying Nest, daughter or sister of King Cadell ap Brochfael.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reign ==\u000aPrecious little is known of Merfyn's reign. Thornton suggests that Merfyn was probably among the Welsh kings who were defeated by Ecgberht, king of Wessex, in the year 830, but it is unknown how this affected Merfyn's rule.\u000aMerfyn is mentioned as a king of the Britons in a copyist's addition to the Historia Brittonum and in the Bamberg Cryptogram,  but as both sources are traced to people working in Merfyn's own court during his reign, it should not be considered more significant than someone's respectful reference to his patron while working in his service.\u000aIn the literary sources, Merfyn's name appears in the Dialogue between Myrddin and his sister Gwenddydd (Welsh: Cyfoesi Myrddin a Gwenddydd ei chwaer), found in the mid-13th-century manuscript known as the Red Book of Hergest. The dialogue is a prophecy of the future kings, and lists among them Merfyn in the passage "meruin vrych o dir manaw" (English: Merfyn Frych of the land of Manau).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Children ==\u000a\u000aRhodri the Great\u000aGwriad\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of rulers of Gwynedd\u000aKings of Wales family trees\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aDerolez, R.

aVThe Haute école de musique de Lausanne (HEMU, known as Institute of Advanced Musical Studies prior to 2010, founded in 1861 as Conservatoire de Lausanne) is a one hundred and fifty-six-year-old Swiss music school located in Romandy, the French-speaking district of part of western Switzerland. It is a constituent institution of the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aName change in 2010\u000aUntil the summer of 2010, the name, "Conservatoire de Lausanne", referred to two schools with different objectives and faculties. The Music School was public institution for educating children and young adults. The Institute of Advanced Musical Studies, based in Lausanne, Sion, and Fribourg, offered a comprehensive higher education for aspiring professional musicians. To mitigate the ensuing confusion, administrators in 2010 launched two new distinct identities. The School of Music became the Lausanne Conservatory and the Lausanne Institute of Advanced Musical Studies adopted the acronym HEMU for Haute école de musique. On September 1, 2008, classical music schools of Sion and Fribourg integrated with HEMU.\u000aFounding in 1861\u000aThe Haute école de musique de Lausanne was founded in 1861 as the Conservatoire de Lausanne with a mandate of training and educating aspiring professional musicians. HEMU is a comprehensive music school that offers degrees leading to accredited bachelor's and master's degrees. HEMU has a cooperative affiliation with the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland.\u000aCollege divisions\u000aHEMU currently has two divisions: Classical and Jazz. In 2013, approximately 300 students were enrolled in Classical and 60 in Jazz. According to the HEMU website, its jazz department is the only one of its kind in French-speaking Switzerland. Jazz at HEMU was launched in 2006.\u000aLibrary\u000aHEMU has a large music library of scores, literature, references, and recordings.\u000aPre-college division\u000aLausanne Conservatory for children and young adults has, as of 2012, an enrollment of about 1,200 students.\u000aTheater school\u000aIn 1909, the institution launched an acting school \u2014 Section professionnelle d'art dramatique du Conservatoire de Lausanne (SPAD). As of 2003, the acting school has been located in the Haute École de théâtre ("High School of Theater" or "HESTR") in Romandy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Accreditation ==\u000aThe HEMU bachelor's and master's degrees are accredited by the Swiss government and the Music and Performing Arts division of the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland (HES-SO), Switzerland's largest institution of constituent schools and colleges involved in research, higher education, and professional training.

aVHoppy the Marvel Bunny is a fictional comic book superhero and funny animal originally published by Fawcett Comics as a spin-off of Captain Marvel. He was created by Chad Grothkopf (1914\u20132005), and debuted in Fawcett's Funny Animals #1 (Dec. 1942). Hoppy later became a property of DC Comics, and has made periodic appearances in Captain Marvel-related stories.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Publication history ==\u000aHoppy debuted in Fawcett's Funny Animals #1, and appears in nearly every issue of that comic's run. He also starred in his own 15-issue series, Hoppy the Marvel Bunny (Dec. 1945 \u2013 Sept. 1947), which featured several Hoppy stories per issue, along with stories featuring his old co-stars from Fawcett's Funny Animals.\u000aFor a span of five issues (#49\u201354, May\u2013Oct. 1947), Hoppy made no appearances in Fawcett's Funny Animals; these issues featured Billy the Kid and Oscar as the lead feature. Beginning with #55, Hoppy returned as the main feature. In Fawcett's Funny Animals #69 (Feb. 1951), the Captain Marvel Bunny stories were dropped, to be replaced by stories with just Hoppy. There was no further mention of his career as Captain Marvel Bunny. In issue #80 the word "Fawcett's" was dropped from the title, making the remaining issues simply Funny Animals. The final issue of Funny Animals was #83 (1953).\u000aAfter Fawcett cancelled Funny Animals, the rights to many of its characters were purchased by Charlton Comics. Charlton resumed publication of "Funny Animals" with #84 and continued the series to #91 (February 1956). Hoppy also appeared in Charlton's Atomic Mouse, though these stories appear to be edited reprints from Fawcett's Funny Animals. For these reprints, Charlton removed the lightning bolt from Marvel Bunny's suit and recolored the costume, changing his name to Magic Bunny and his magic word to "Alizam!". He is alternately referred to in various Charlton books as "Hoppy", "Happy", "Happy the Magic Bunny" and, according to one source, "Speedy".\u000aAfter the Fawcett characters were purchased by DC Comics, Hoppy returned in DC Comics Presents #34 (June 1981). Hoppy has turned up sporadically since, primarily in The Oz-Wonderland War #2, in The Power of Shazam! #29, and in Tiny Titans #15.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Fictional character biography ==\u000aHoppy is a pink bunny rabbit who lives in the town of Funny Animalville, along with an assortment of other funny animal characters. As revealed in the origin story from Fawcett's Funny Animals #1, Hoppy is a fan of Captain Marvel. One day he decides to emulate his hero and speaks the magic word "Shazam!" Surprisingly, the magic word transforms Hoppy into Captain Marvel Bunny.\u000a\u000aIn Fawcett's Funny Animals #30 (July 1945), an explanation for Hoppy's powers is revealed. In the story "Hoppy Meets the Wizard Bunny", Hoppy is hit on the head and develops amnesia. The mysterious Wizard Bunny (or Bunny Wizard, both versions are used) is watching, and he flies down to help Hoppy regain his memory. A panel in this story states "Because it was he who bestowed the magic word and power upon Hoppy, the Bunny Wizard flies down to Earth to help Hoppy". Eventually the Wizard gets Hoppy to say "Shazam!" and his memory is restored, along with his abilities. This is the Bunny Wizard's only known appearance.\u000aThe word "Shazam!" has a slightly different meaning for Hoppy. According to the E. Nelson Bridwell scripted story, The Oz-Wonderland War #2, Captain Marvel Bunny has the wisdom of Salamander, the strength of Hogules, the stamina of Antlers, the power of Zebreus, the courage of Abalone, and the speed of Monkury.\u000aHoppy's stories occasionally feature his girlfriend Millie, who (like Lois Lane) despises the meek Hoppy but worships the heroic Captain Marvel Bunny. Millie has no idea that Hoppy could become the Marvel Bunny.\u000aA noteworthy foe appeared in Fawcett's Funny Animals #32 (Oct\u2013Nov 1945). In the lead story of that issue, Hoppy faces Captain Black Bunny, who is based on Captain Marvel's foe Black Adam. Captain Black Bunny wears a black costume similar to Black Adam's, though the bad bunny wears a cape like Hoppy and instead of a lightning bolt he has a yellow flame on his chest. Captain Black Bunny comes from deep within the Earth's core and is aided by a gang of imps.\u000aIn Hoppy's first appearance in DC Comics (in DC Comics Presents #34), Hoppy and Millie find themselves magically transported to Earth-S, the home of the Marvel Family in the Pre-Crisis DC Universe. He aids the Marvel Family and Superman against Mr. Mind, Mr. Mxyzptlk, and King Kull. In this story both Hoppy and Millie were depicted as white bunnies, instead of their usual pink.\u000aHoppy appears in The Oz-Wonderland War #2, where he fights alongside Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew. His silhouette is briefly seen in Limbo, where forgotten characters from DC continuity currently reside, pursued by Ace the Bat-Hound, which is the character's last recorded appearance in the DC Multiverse, during the events of Final Crisis.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Powers and abilities ==\u000aHoppy has powers roughly similar to those of Captain Marvel. He accesses his powers by yelling "SHAZAM!" but his pantheon differs. His patron deities are Salamander, Hogules, Antlers, Zebreus, Abalone and Monkury.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aThunder Bunny\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aHoppy the Marvel Bunny at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

aVThis is a list of characters and their voice actors from Legend of the Galactic Heroes.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Main characters ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Reinhard von Lohengramm ===\u000aReinhard von Lohengramm, is one of the protagonists in the series along with Yang Wen-li. Nicknamed The Golden Brat by his foes and The Golden Lion by his supporters, he was born into a noble but poor family as Reinhard von Müsel. As a child, he lived with his father and his older sister, Annerose. (He encountered his mother's death when he was still very young and thus his memories of her were very faint.)\u000aIt is in a middle-class neighbourhood, into which Reinhard's family moves, that Reinhard meets Siegfried Kircheis, with whom he develops an intimate friendship. When his father was compelled to sell Annerose for money as a concubine of Emperor Friedrich IV, young Reinhard swears to put an end to the Goldenbaum Dynasty. His determination to avenge the corrupted society thereupon kindles.\u000aHe decides to leave home to join the Cadet School, and persuades Kircheis to come with him. At the age of 15, Reinhard and Kircheis enter their first active service in the army; their rapid promotion in rank follows, owing it to their outstanding contributions to the country. With brilliancy in military strategy especially at a macro-level, and giftedness in civil affairs and in identifying ones with talent, Reinhard succeeds in attracting a great number of able officers, gaining as well the admiration of the public. In solidifying his grounds by gathering advocates, Reinhard does not miss an opportunity to take advantage of his handsomeness and other charming qualities. After being admitted to admiralty at the age of 21, Friedrich IV confers Reinhard the name of Lohengramm, a name of high noble rank which had been defunct until the occasion.\u000aAs his next step, he quickly extends his influence over state matters, and shortly after the decease of the Emperor, eventually overthrows the pre-existing dynasty and marks the beginning of the Lohengramm Dynasty. Reinhard's coronation does not precede his own death by much. Believing that the Universe should be reigned over by the most powerful and capable person, Reinhard leaves a will to his Empress consort Hildegard, in which he states that if their son (Alexander Siegfried) fails to prove promising as his successor, there should be no reason for the Lohengramm Dynasty to continue. He dies of an unprecedented congenital disease for which no cure seems to have existed at the time. The disease is posthumously named The Emperor's Sickness by the confused physicians.\u000aThough a matchless genius by all account, Reinhard's main flaw lies in the restriction of his emotions, as he opens his heart to two people only: his beloved sister Annerose and his closest friend and loyal companion Kircheis. Not even his wife Hildegard is allowed within. Annerose describes him as a star that shines brightly until it completely burns itself out; that the day Reinhard slows down his pace would be the dawn of his end.\u000aThe flagship of Reinhard is called Brünhild. As it is exclusively painted in white, the flagship is easily distinguishable. Built with the latest technology of the time, the battleship earns a sobriquet \u2018The Unsinkable Ship', for surviving all of her battles without a single damage in spite of its constant acting as a spearhead of the fleet. The only damage Brünhild ever receives is caused by an infiltration from which a direct engagement of battle ensues with a boarding party of 730 combatants led by Julian Mintz towards the end of the series. The ship is decommissioned after Reinhard's death and thereafter remains in Dock 01 of the Galactic Empire Odin as a memento.\u000aThe character is voiced by Ry\u014d Horikawa in the OVA series. In 2018 anime, he is voiced by Mamoru Miyano.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Yang Wen-li ===\u000aYang Wen-li, voiced by Kei Tomiyama (OVA series) and later by Hozumi G\u014dda (Gaiden series), is one of two protagonists within the series. Like Reinhard, both of them share similar roles within their respective nations as famous national heroes renowned for their military skill. Compared to Reinhard, Yang is much more humble and dislikes his popularity as being a burden. Yang originally wanted to become a historian and only attended the Free Planets Defense Force Command Academy so he can get free education, while Reinhard relishes his fame and was ambitious to overthrow the empire. At the start of the series, Yang has gained some fame as the "Hero of El Facil" for his exploits in the evacuation of the planet before Imperial occupation, and gains much more fame to become a national hero by the end of the first season. During the second season, he generally takes a lesser role compared to Reinhard, but returns in full force in Season 3 before he is assassinated by members of the Terraist Church. Yang was a mild-tempered person who lives on red tea, a genius tactician and strategist that exceeds even Reinhard. Yang's weakness lies in his unwillingness to risk democracy by assuming more direct powers and responsibilities. Not willing to take on a bigger role or responsibility, he and Reinhard's battle were never in equal footing and at same time handcuffing him from doing things that could change the scale of the power balance. He also openly respects Reinhard and considers him to be a true genius as Reinhard's ability does not seem to confine in just military affairs and is able to act on what his mind tells him while Yang might be reluctant to do so if given same situation. He also agrees that benevolent autocracy is better and more efficient than corrupted democracy if social change is needed, and noted that if he was born in the empire, he would actually volunteer to serve under Reinhard despite his dislike of military. On the other hand, he was glad to be born in Free Planets as it gives him the freedom, and believes that while democracy is less efficient and can be slowed dramatically with corruption it nevertheless is better because it is less likely to be corrupted completely and no one has absolute power, because after all, a good and wise Emperor such as Reinhard doesn't come along often.\u000aThe Hyperion is the flagship of Yang Wen-li. It is retrofitted from a frontier security squadron flagship. It is lightly armed, possessing only 32 forward cannons which comprise its main armament. It possesses a large and spread out multi-level bridge with a large conference table commonly used for meetings by Admiral Yang and his staff, as well as a large tactical viewscreen used during battle to display fleet movements.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Hildegard von Mariendorf ===\u000aHildegard von Mariendorf, voiced by Masako Katsuki, is one of the principal characters in the series. She served as the New Galactic Fleet's Chief Advisor, and later reigned with Reinhard von Lohengramm when she became his wife and Empress in 801 UC.\u000aHildegard, usually referred to by the nickname Hilda, was born in 777 UC into a distinguished noble family of the Goldenbaum Dynasty, the sole daughter of the benevolent and just Count Franz von Mariendorf. From an early age, she was distinguished from the other girls of the aristocrat society by her independent ideas. Completely unconcerned, Hilda pursued her own interests in reading, politics and history. Her mother having died when Hilda was young, her open-minded father respected Hilda's unique ideas and choices in life.\u000aIn 797 UC, the old Galactic Empire split into civil war, where the old nobility stood against the new emerging camp of military elites led by Reinhard von Lohengramm. Hilda convinced her father to plea allegiance to the latter, whereupon she met Reinhard for the first time and impressed him with the clarity of her insight. When the Lohengramm camp emerged victorious from the civil war, Reinhard gained complete political and military power in the empire, and Hilda became Reinhard's chief secretary and assisted him in the progressive reforms that swept across the empire.\u000aFrom 798 UC to 800 UC, Hilda played an active role on the galactic stage, advising Reinhard wisely on imperial policies and tactics, and became one of his most valued and trusted staff. During Operation Ragnarök, where the empire battled the Alliance, Hilda served as a staff officer on board the flagship Brünhild. During the critical Battle of Vermilion, she perceived that the situation was in Reinhard's disfavour, and persuaded Admirals Mittermeyer and Reuenthal to mobilize forces against the Alliance capital, turning the war to Reinhard's tactical victory and saving his life. Admiral Mittermeyer later praised Hilda that "her intelligence is worth more than a fleet." Her role gradually became more public after Reinhard's coronation as the first Emperor of the new Lohengramm Dynasty. In the year UC 800, in the Ninth Battle of Iserlohn, Hilda succeeded Admiral Steinmetz to become the Fleet's Chief Advisor, formally capable of representing the Emperor and command on his behalf on the battlefield. Conscious of her military position, Hilda withheld her political role and refused to advise Reinhard on political matters, despite his repeated requests for her counsel.\u000aIn August 800 UC, Reinhard was attacked by an assassin who sought vengeance for Reinhard's inaction in the Westerland tragedy. Overcame with regret and emotional agony, Reinhard withdrew into his own quarters and Hilda entered to console him. Subconsciously realizing that his reliance on her has deepened past their professional relationship, he asked her to stay, and she agreed, determined to help him to the best of her abilities. The morning after, Reinhard came to Hilda's home and proposed marriage, and Hilda did not immediately reply for the uncertainty whether she can truly give him happiness. She also did not reveal her pregnancy to him until after the Urvashi affair and Reuenthal's subsequent rebellion, which deepened the insight of both Hilda and Reinhard toward their own feelings. When peace was restored, Hilda accepted Reinhard's second proposal, and they were married on January 19, 801 UC. The officials of the empire greeted their new Empress with enthusiasm and joy. On May 14, while Reinhard was away at war, Hilda give birth to a son, whom Reinhard named Alexander Siegfried von Lohengramm. Reinhard's illness seriously exacerbated a mere sixteen days later and was diagnosed with a rare form mutative connective tissue disease, with no known cure. Despite the illness, Reinhard decided to return to the imperial capital for the sake of the people awaiting him there. On July 18, Reinhard and Hilda were re-united. On July 26, the dying Reinhard said his final words to Hilda: "My Empress, you shall rule the universe more wisely than I. If you think setting up a constitution is the better way then so be it. The universe would be fine as long as the strongest and wisest among all the living governs it. If Alexander Seigfried lacks that ability, there is no need for Lohengramm dynasty to continue. Do everything as you wish; that is my greatest wish..." He died at the age of twenty-five, with their son succeeding him and Hilda ruling as the Empress dowager.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Siegfried Kircheis ===\u000aSiegfried Kircheis, voiced by Masashi Hironaka, flagship Barbarossa. Is usually seen together with Reinhard. Even though Kircheis died very early in the series while protecting Reinhard, he serves as an important role in the series. Reinhard refer him by his last name Kircheis despite their close relationship because Reinhard thought the name Siegfried is too common and boring, while his sister Annerose refer him as Sieg. Kircheis is one of the two most important people in Reinhard's life. Not only does he offer his advice to Reinhard, but he is someone that helps him stay on the right path. Reinhard has always said that Kircheis is someone that can see someone virtuous even in a sewer, and has always had positive thinking no matter what the situation. Kircheis dislikes bloodshed, instead he would rather enemies surrender peacefully and will not pursue a retreating enemy for a kill. He is like Reinhard's shadow even though he is just as talented and intelligent, but Sieg is very satisfied and does not care for power or position, instead he would rather stay by Reinhard's side and protect him. 10 years before the start of the series, Kircheis made a promised Annerose to protect Reinhard and has faithfully kept it ever since. It is hinted that Kircheis is in love with Annerose and that the feeling was mutual, despite neither ever expressing it to each other (at least not shown in any media version). Throughout the series many character have expressed their feelings on how Reinhard might act differently had Kircheis stayed alive. Which often leads to fans believing that if Kircheis hadn't died so early he may have helped Reinhard become even more powerful and lessen his workload which may have prevented Reinhard's death and may even have ended the war more quickly.\u000aAs a military commander, Kircheis was given the highest praise by Yang, stating that Kircheis has no opening for him to take advantage of nor able to allowing him to retreat successfully. Yang also commented after the prisoner exchange that he is more fond of Kircheis (despite it being a quick meeting) than any of politicians in his own country. For the short time he was active in the novel, he was referred to as Reinhard's "Undefeatable Admiral" or as the "Red-hair Brat" by the high nobles. Kircheis earned the respect of all of Reinhard's other Admirals and effectively secured his place as the "Number 2" man in Lord Reinhard's ranks. Kind and handsome, he is described to have "flame-like" red hair. Kircheis and Lord Reinhard were inseparable as both friends and war comrades. During the first season, Lady Annerose told Kircheis that should Lord Reinhard one day stop listening to him, then he will walk down the path of self-destruction. His flagship Barbarossa was originally going to be a Brunhild class ship like Reinhard's but Kircheis decided that Brunhild should be in a class by its own and declined it in the novel. The ship's body is painted in red in reference to his "flame-like" hair. It is also the only ship in series that was never damaged, and according to the databooks, it was decommissioned after Kircheis's death and awarded the spot of Dock 02, docked right next to Brunhild as memento. Despite various posthumous titles given to him by Reinhard, on his tombstone there was only an engraving of his name and phrase "My friend".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Julian Mintz ===\u000aThe adopted teenage son of Yang Wen-li. Julian's role as Yang Wen-li's assistant starts as a minor character in the beginning of the series, usually seen as taking care of his messy and haphazard adopted guardian, but as the story progresses he becomes more central to the story of the Free Planets Alliance's struggle. Yang Wen-li regularly expressed a desire that Julian would not become a soldier, rather advocating that Julian take a civilian role, perhaps in government, but eventually consents to Julian\u2019s entry into the armed forces. After a successful mission to Earth to uncover and eventually (with the inadvertent assistance of the Imperial troops) destroy the headquarters of the notorious Terraist Church, he rises in stature before finally rising after the events of the third series to the reluctant military leader of the Iserlohn Republic Government, at age 18. An astute military commander not unlike his guardian, Julian succeeded into entering negotiations with Kaiser Reinhard after the Battle of Shiva where he negotiated for the autonomy of the planet Heinessen and its surrounding starzone in exchange for control of Iserlohn Fortress. He is voiced by Nozomu Sasaki.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Supporting characters ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Oskar von Reuenthal ===\u000aOskar von Reuenthal voiced by Norio Wakamoto, flagship Tristan, is someone with vast intelligence and talent. Nicked name "Bewitching Eyes" for his complete heterochromia. He swore his loyalty to Reinhard when he asked Reinhard to save Mittermeyer from the Goldenbaum Dynasty. Even though he is loyal, he sometimes has thoughts about attaining even more power for himself, which led to his downfall. He has no problems finding women, but he despises the idea of settling down and having children because his mother attempted to kill him when he was an infant due to his heterochromatic eyes. In the end his pride compelled him to rebel after being framed for an assassination attempt against Reinhard and died of wounds taken during a battle against Mittermeyer, but in his heart he was still supportive and loyal to him. Reuenthal left the son that he had with Elfriede von Kohlrausch, to Mittermeyer.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Wolfgang Mittermeyer ===\u000aWolfgang Mittermeyer voiced by Katsuji Mori, flagship Beowulf, is best friends with Reuenthal and both were together referred to as the "Twin Pillars of the Empire", after the death of Kircheis. Mittermeyer served with Reunthal as Reinhard's Fleet Admirals in the new dynasty. Mittermeyer is highly disciplined and moral, finding himself often siding with Reunthal against Oberstein, but also just as often keeping Reunthal's musings in check. His attacks were often seen as swift as a gale of wind, earning him the nickname "The Gale Wolf". Mittermeyer is also married to Evangeline, whom he met when young and still loves very much. They had tried to have children for many years without success, and later adopted Reuenthal's son as his own, his wife naming the child Felix.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Paul von Oberstein ===\u000aPaul von Oberstein voiced by Kaneto Shiozawa, first served as Reinhard's advisor and later as Minister of Military Affairs. He has two cybernetic eyes as well as a cold and emotionless personality which makes most people dislike him. He is a strategic genius but is weak wherever human emotions are involved. He is, however, one of Reinhard von Lohengramm's most efficient subordinates, and extremely concerned about the well-being of the new dynasty. He dies during a terrorist attack conducted by the Terraist Church. It is not clear whether he died as a decoy for Reinhard or if it was simply a miscalculation on his plan. He has a dog, for whom he cares deeply.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Fritz Josef Bittenfeld ===\u000aFritz Josef Bittenfeld voiced by Keiichi Noda, flagship Königs Tiger [German: Königstiger, English: King Tiger], is the commander of the Schwarz Lanzenreiter (Black Lancers), who are experts in hunter-killer tactics. Bittenfeld was in Reinhard's fleet when Reinhard was just a vice admiral. Bittenfeld is known as a 'wild boar' because of his aggressiveness and temper, and often has problems with Paul von Oberstein because of that.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ulrich Kesler ===\u000aUlrich Kesler voiced by Sh\u016bichi Ikeda, usually does administrative police work and helps Reinhard investigate. He is a righteous individual and very reliable. Reinhard first heard of Kesler from police records where Kesler defended a woman who was supposed to be tortured to death for stepping on a painting of the Kaiser. Kesler was usually sent to serve in rural areas or in similar unpopular assignments as indirect punishment for his integrity under the corrupt old rule. During the 6th Iserlohn battle, Reinhard told Kesler when he gained more power he would give Kesler a position in Odin that is suited for his abilities. After Reinhard's coronation he is assigned as the leader of the military police. While preventing an assassination attempt against Kaiserine Hildegard and Crown Princess Annerose by the Terraist cult, he meets Marika von Freuerbach, a servant, whom he marries two years later. He is also promoted to Fleet Admiral after Reinhard\u2019s death.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Neidhardt Müller ===\u000aNeidhardt Müller voiced by Y\u016b Mizushima, flagship Lübeck, is known as the "Iron Shield" in honor of successfully defending Reinhard in the Battle of Vermillion to the point of changing his command to five different ships after the destruction of the previous ones, including his own flagship. Müller was awarded the new class battleship Percivale in recognition of his service. He is the youngest of all Reinhard's admirals.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Adalbert von Fahrenheit ===\u000aAdalbert von Fahrenheit voiced by Sh\u014d Hayami, flagship Ahsgrimm, is known for his strong offensive tactics. Fahrenheit opposed Reinhard during the Lippschadt war, but surrendered and was given amnesty after the war ended. Highly valued for his capabilities, Fahrenheit was restored to active duty as one of Reinhard's Admirals. He is later killed in battle at the Isherlohn Corridor.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ernst von Eisenach ===\u000aErnst von Eisenach voiced by Masane Tsukayama, known as the Silent Admiral. He is not really mute and is known for surprising all the admirals once by uttering merely "Checkmate" after a strategic meeting. He usually uses hand signs in lieu of verbal commands to direct his fleet in battle.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Groups ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Reich / Galactic Empire ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Lohengramm faction ====\u000aReinhard von Lohengramm (von Müsel) -

aVAustralian Free Church is a Presbyterian denomination in Australia.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe Australian Free Church was established in 1979 when Eric Turnbull (1928-2013) was removed from being a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia. According to Rowland Ward and Robert Humphreys, this was for "refusing to desist from teaching that the King James Bible is the very Word of God to the exclusion of other translations," such as the NIV or NASB, although the church's website states that it was formed "out of a desire to maintain the standards of doctrine, worship and church government held by our Scottish spiritual forebears." The church website also states they "use the Authorised Version (KJV) as the most faithful English translation."\u000aTurnbull was the minister at East St Kilda and took the more active part of the congregation with him. After several moves a church building was purchased in Chadstone in 1988. A number of people in Hamilton also adhered to the Australian Free Church. In 1994 the Australian Free Church applied to join the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland but their application was declined. They have fraternal relations with the Free Church of Scotland (Continuing). The first Presbytery of the Australian Free Church was constituted in 2002.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Statistics ==\u000aThere are currently congregations in Chadstone, Beaufort and Hamilton,. The Rockhampton congregation was received in 2009 and had previously been a congregation of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church that had withdrawn from that body, but subsequently broke up. The Deep Lead/Stawell Congregation was established in early 2012-but disassociated in 2014, the minister subsequently being called to a Reformed and Presbyterian Congregation in Rockhampton. The total following is about 30 people including three ministers, one with seven children residing in Beaufort (Vic).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Theology ==\u000aThe Australian Free Church holds to the historic Presbyterian confessions, these are:\u000aWestminster Confession of Faith\u000aWestminster Shorter Catechism\u000aWestminster Larger Catechism \u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of Presbyterian denominations in Australia\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial site

aVThe Reef Ball Foundation, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) publicly supported non-profit organization that functions as an international environmental Non-governmental organization. The foundation uses Reef Ball artificial reef technology, combined with coral propagation, transplant technology, public education and community training to build, restore and protect coral reefs. The foundation has established "Reef Ball reefs" in 59 countries, and ongoing projects take the total countries reached to more than 70. Over 550,000 Reef Balls have been deployed in more than 4,000 projects.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe Reef Ball Foundation was started in 1993 by Todd Barber, who founded the Reef Ball Development Group INC. with a goal of helping to preserve and protect coral reefs for the benefit of future generations. An avid scuba diver, Barber witnessed his favorite coral reef on Grand Cayman destroyed by Hurricane Gilbert, and wanted to do something to help increase the resiliency of eroding coral reefs. Barber and his father patented the idea of building artificial reef modules with a central inflatable bladder, so that the modules would be buoyant, thus making them easy to deploy by hand or with a small boat, rather than requiring heavy machinery.\u000aOver the next few years, with the help of research colleagues at University of Georgia, Nationwide Artificial Reef Coordinators and the Florida Institute of Technology, Barber and a small number of colleagues and business partners worked to perfect the design. Reef balls can be found in almost every coastal state in the United States, and on every continent including Antarctica. The Foundation has expanded the scope of its projects to include coral rescue, propagation and transplant operations, mitigation projects, mangrove restorations and nursery development. Reef Ball also participates in education and outreach regarding environmental stewardship and coral reefs.\u000aIn 2001, The Reef Ball Foundation took control of the Reef Ball Development Group, and now operates all aspects of the business as a non-profit organization. By 2007, the foundation had deployed 550,000 reef balls worldwide.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Mission ==\u000aThe Foundation states the mission of the development group as follows:\u000a\u000aThe Reef Ball Development Group is a volunteer group whose mission statement charters the group to help restore our world's ocean ecosystems through the development and use of aesthetically pleasing, ecologically sound, and economically designed artificial reefs. We emphasize on-going research, public education, community involvement, and reefs that promote and support natural species diversity and population density.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Technology and research ==\u000a\u000aThe Reef Ball Foundation manufactures reef balls for open ocean deployment in sizes from 30 centimetres (1 ft) in diameter and 15 kilograms (33 lb), up to 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) and 3,500 kilograms (8,000 lb). Reef balls are hollow, and typically have several convex-concave holes of varying sizes to most closely approximate natural coral reef conditions by creating whirlpools. Reef balls are made from pH balanced microsilica concrete, and are treated to create a rough surface texture, in order to promote settling by marine organisms such as corals, algae, coralline algae, and sponges.\u000aOver the last decade, scientific research has been conducted with respect to the ability of artificial reefs to produce or attract biomass, and the effectiveness of reef balls in replicating natural habitat, and mitigating disasters. The use of reef balls as breakwaters and for beach stabilization has also been extensively studied.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Publication ===\u000aThe Reef ball foundation publishes in the Aquaculture Research & Development, which is the official journal of the society.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Projects ===\u000aThe Foundation undertakes an array of projects including artificial reef deployment, estuary restoration, mangrove plantings, oyster reef creation, coral propagation, natural disaster recovery, erosion control, and education on reef preservation.\u000aSome notable projects include:\u000aIn Antigua, undertaking the world's largest coral propagation and planting project using artificial reefs.\u000aIn Malaysia, using 5,000 reef balls around protected sea turtle nesting islands to deter netting, successfully increasing nesting numbers.\u000aIn Campeche, Mexico, using over 4,000 reef balls deployed by local fishing communities to enhance fishery resources.\u000aIn Tampa Bay, USA, using reef balls beneath docks, in front of sea walls, and as a submerged breakwater to create oyster reefs.\u000aIn Phuket, Thailand, using reef balls planted with corals after the Boxing Day Tsunami to help restore tourism.\u000aIn Indonesia, using locals and P.T. Newmont to mitigate damage from mining operations and restore thousands of coral heads.\u000aIn Australia, reef balls have been used to enhance fisheries in New South Wales.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Designed artificial reefs ===\u000aThe trend in artificial reef development has been toward the construction of designed artificial reefs, built from materials specifically designed to function as reefs. Designed systems (such as reef balls) can be modified to achieve a variety of goals. These include coral reef rehabilitation, fishery enhancement, snorkeling and diving trails, beach erosion protection, surfing enhancement, fish spawning sites, planters for mangrove replanting, enhancement of lobster fisheries, creation of oyster reefs, estuary rehabilitation, and even exotic uses such as deep water Oculina coral replanting. Designed systems can overcome many of the problems associated with "materials of opportunity" such as stability in storms, durability, biological fit, lack of potential pollution problems, availability, and reduction in long term artificial reef costs.\u000aDesigned reefs have been developed specifically for coral reef rehabilitation, and can therefore be used in a more specific niche than materials of opportunity. Some examples of specialized adaptations which "designed reefs" can use include: specialized surface textures, coral planting attachment points, specialized pH-neutral surfaces (such as neutralized concrete, ceramics or mineral accretion surfaces), fissures to create currents for corals, and avoidance of materials such as iron (which may cause algae to overgrow coral). Other types of designed systems can create aquaculture opportunities for lobsters, create oyster beds, or be used for a large variety of other specialized needs.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aUnderwater sculptures\u000aProject AWARE\u000aReef Check\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aReef Ball Foundation\u000aReef Ball Coral Team\u000a\u000aReef Beach Ltd - reef balls for erosion control and beach rehabilitation\u000aEternal Reefs - reef balls as memorials\u000aReef Ball Shared Resources - scientific literature and documentation

aVJoseph Holt (January 6, 1807 \u2013 August 1, 1894) was a leading member of the Buchanan administration and was Judge Advocate General of the United States Army, most notably during the Lincoln assassination trials.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aJoseph Holt was born in Breckinridge County, Kentucky, on January 6, 1807. He was educated at St. Joseph's College in Bardstown, Kentucky and Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. He settled in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, and set up a law office in town. He married Mary Harrison and moved to Louisville, Kentucky, in 1832. There, he became assistant editor of the Louisville Public Advertiser and the Commonwealth's Attorney from 1833 to 1835. Holt moved to Port Gibson, Mississippi, and practiced law there as well as in Natchez, Mississippi and Vicksburg, Mississippi. Holt and his wife contracted tuberculosis. Mary died of it, and Joseph returned to Louisville to recuperate.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Buchanan administration ==\u000aHolt remarried, to Margaret Wickliffe. In 1857, Holt was appointed Commissioner of Patents by President Buchanan and moved to Washington D.C.. He served until 1859, when Buchanan appointed him Postmaster General. The Buchanan administration was shaken in December 1860 and January 1861, when the Confederacy was formed and many cabinet members resigned, but Holt was both against slavery and strongly for the Union. He was appointed Secretary of War upon the resignation of John B. Floyd of Virginia. Holt served as Secretary of War until the end of Buchanan's presidency.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Judge Advocate General ==\u000aHolt joined the Army as a colonel in 1862 and was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to be the Judge Advocate General of the Union Army; two years later, he was promoted to brigadier general. He was the first Judge Advocate General to hold a general's rank. He personally prosecuted the court-martial against Major General Fitz John Porter for crimes of disobedience of a lawful order and misbehavior in front of the enemy. Lincoln also offered Holt the position of Secretary of the Interior that same year and Attorney General later in 1864, but Holt declined both offices.\u000aHe was one of the many politicians considered for the Republican Vice Presidential nomination in 1864. It went to Andrew Johnson, and Lincoln was re-elected.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Abraham Lincoln assassination ===\u000a\u000aOn April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. Booth's accomplice, Lewis Powell seriously injured Secretary of State Seward, and Vice President Johnson was also targeted. Holt prepared an order for the signature of Johnson for the arrest of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and five other suspects. Booth was caught on April 26, 1865 but killed by Boston Corbett, a soldier who violated orders.\u000aAs Judge Advocate General of the Army, Holt was the chief prosecutor in the trial of the accused conspirators before a military commission chaired by General David Hunter. Two assistant judge advocates, John Bingham and General Henry Lawrence Burnett assisted Holt. The defendants were George Atzerodt, David Herold, Powell, Samuel Arnold, Michael O'Laughlen, Edman Spangler, Samuel Mudd, and Mary Surratt. The trial began on May 10, 1865 and lasted two months. Holt and Bingham attempted to obscure the fact that there were two plots. The first plot was to kidnap Lincoln and exchange him for Confederate prisoners held by the Union. The second was to assassinate Lincoln, Johnson, and Seward and so throw the government into chaos.\u000aIt was important for the prosecution not to reveal the existence of a diary taken from the body of Booth. The diary made it clear that the assassination plan dated from 14 April. Surprisingly, the defense did not call for Booth's diary to be produced in court. Holt was accused of withholding evidence, but it was never proven.\u000aOn June 29, 1865, the eight were found guilty of conspiracy to kill the President. Arnold, O'Laughlen, and Mudd were sentenced to life in prison, Spangler to six years in prison, and Atzerodt, Herold, Powell, and Surratt to be hanged, the first woman ever to be executed by the US federal government. They were executed July 7, 1865.\u000aO'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Arnold, Spangler, and Mudd were pardoned by Johnson in early 1869. Accusations still remain that Surratt's sentence of hanging had been reduced before the hanging.\u000aHolt's public image was besmirched by the trial and his prosecution of it, and many historians believe that the controversy surrounding it ended Holt's political career. In 1866, Holt issued a pamphlet, titled Vindication of Judge Advocate General Holt From the Foul Slanders of Traitors, Confessed Perjurers and Suborners, Acting in the Interest of Jefferson Davis, in which he attempted to defend himself against the various allegations and clear up some of the confusion stemming from the trial.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Later life ==\u000aHolt served as Judge Advocate General until he retired on December 1, 1875. He had a quiet retirement and died in Washington on August 1, 1894. He is buried in the Holt Family Cemetery in Addison, Kentucky. Holt County, Nebraska is named after him, as is the hamlet of Holtsville, New York and the town of Holt, Michigan.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aCamp Joe Holt\u000aList of American Civil War generals (Union)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aBell, William Gardner (1992).

aVThe 1964 Winter Olympics, officially known as the IX Olympic Winter Games (French: Les IXes Jeux olympiques d'hiver) (German: Olympische Winterspiele 1964), was a winter multi-sport event which was celebrated in Innsbruck, Austria, from January 29 to February 9, 1964. The Games included 1091 athletes from 36 nations, and the Olympic Torch was carried by Joseph Rieder, a former alpine skier who had participated in the 1956 Winter Olympics.\u000aThe Games were affected by the deaths of Australian alpine skier Ross Milne and British luge slider Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski, during training, and by the deaths, three years earlier, of the entire US figure skating team and family members.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Host city selection ==\u000aInnsbruck had to compete with Calgary, Canada, and Lahti, Finland for the right to host the 1964 Winter Olympics. Here is the resulting vote count that occurred at the 55th IOC Session in Munich, West Germany, on May 26, 1959.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Games highlights ==\u000aThe games was opened by a concert performed by Vienna Philharmonic, under the baton of Karl Böhm. Beethoven's 7th Symphony and Mozart's 40th Symphony were performed in the opening concert.\u000aNormally snowy Innsbruck was threatened by a lack of snow.

The organising committee said that Ross crashed into a tree during a training run. The IOC suggested that inexperience may have played a role in Ross's death, whereas Australian manager John Wagner suggested that overcrowding played a role, saying that he tried to slow down "on a spot which was not prepared for stopping or swinging" to avoid a crowd of contestants. His brother Malcolm Milne competed at the 1968 and 1972 Winter Olympics.\u000aOn February 15, 1961, the entire US Figure Skating team and several family members, coaches, and officials were killed when Sabena Flight 548 crashed in Brussels, Belgium en route to the World Championships in Prague. This tragedy sent the US skating program into a period of rebuilding. The loss of the U.S. team was considered so catastrophic for the sport that the 1961 World Championships were cancelled, and impacted later Winter Olympics.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000a1964 Summer Paralympics\u000a1964 Summer Olympics\u000aWinter Olympic Games\u000aOlympic Games\u000aInternational Olympic Committee\u000aList of IOC country codes\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a"Innsbruck 1964".

aVThe Bahá'í Faith in Trinidad and Tobago begins with a mention by `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, in 1916 as the Caribbean was among the places Bahá'ís should take the religion to. The first Bahá'í to visit came in 1927 while pioneers arrived by 1956 and the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1957 In 1971 the first Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly was elected. A count of the community then noted 27 assemblies with Bahá'ís living in 77 locations. Since then Bahá'ís have participated in several projects for the benefit of the wider community and between 2005 and 2010 various sources report near 1.2% of the country, about 10,000\u201316,000 citizens, are Bahá'ís.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Pre-history ==\u000a`Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United Statesin 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919\u2014after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919.\u000a\u000aHis Holiness Christ says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the Kingdom of God.\u2026(travel to) the Islands of the West Indies, such as Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, the Islands of the Lesser Antilles(which includes Trinidad and Tobago), Bahama Islands, even the small Watling Island, have great importance\u2026\u000a\u000aIn 1927 Leonora Armstrong was the first Bahá'í to visit and give lectures about the Bahá'í Faith in many Latin American countries including Trinidad and Tobago as part of her plan to compliment and complete Martha Root's unfulfilled intention of visiting all the Latin American countries for the purpose of presenting the religion to an audience.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades ===\u000aShoghi Effendi wrote a cable on May 1, 1936, to the Bahá'í Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin. In his cable he wrote:\u000a\u000aAppeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by `Abdu'l-Bahá in Tablets of the Divine Plan. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.\u000a\u000aFollowing the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the First Seven Year Plan (1937\u201344), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America.\u000aA few other Bahá'ís are known to have visited the islands before WWII. Mr. and Mrs. Dudley Blakeley visited on their way out from New York city and back during a tour of the Caribbean in 1936\u201337 with their visit resulting in a newspaper story. Wilfred Barton traveled the region and made contact with Trinidadians circa 1939. Anecdotes of a Trinidadian in Canada report a sensitivity to actually being treated equally most probably this is a report of Ralph Laltoo, a student from Trinidad, and son of a United Church Minister. He converted to the religion in October 1940 while in Canada. While the first known Trinidadian Bahá'í however returning to Trinidad in 1943 there would have been no Bahá'í community to be with him and he developed other connections while serving at Naparima College. When Hand of the Cause Dorothy Beecher Baker died in an airplane crash in 1954 in Europe she had been intending to travel to Trinidad. Another early contact between the Bahá'í Faith and a Trinidadian was noticed in 1954 by a policeman serving in Nassau.\u000aDr. Malcolm King promulgated the religion while traveling among the islands starting in 1950. King taught the religion to Mrs. Harriet Phillip, sister to Dr. Cyril Turney, fellow convert and friend to King. Mrs. Phillip became the first person living in Trinidad to convert to the religion. Cyril Turney returned, in 1957, with his daughter, Violet, to Trinidad, where he lived in Belmont. His brother, Albert Turney, later converted and had the first Bahá'í funeral held in his name, when he died. With local converts and a few pioneers, the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was subsequently elected in Port of Spain in 1957.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Inter/National development ==\u000aAs far back as 1951 the Bahá'ís had organized a regional National Assembly for the combination of Mexico, Central America and the Antilles islands. Further Bahá'ís continued to travel to Trinidad and Tobago. Winston Evans toured the Caribbean including Trinidad in 1957. In 1962 Joel Caverly from Massachusetts came to Trinidad for the first time as a member of the music band from the Washington DC Navy School of Music. Israel Posner from Venezuela toured Trinidad promoting the religion in 1964 and was followed by two pioneers from England, Mr. and Mrs. John Firman. The Port of Spain assembly had lapsed but was reformed in 1965 - its members were: Mrs. Baptiste, John Firman, Mrs. Philips, Mrs. Firman, Mr. Paris, Miss Hopkinson, Mrs. George, Mr. Kedheroo, Mrs. Coure. That year the Trinidad Sunday Mirror published a photo of 'Abdu'l-Bahá and an article with the title "A Message of Peace and New Way of Life."\u000aThere were some developments in 1966 - reorganized as a regional national assembly among the Bahá'ís of Leeward, Windward and Virgin Islands with its seat in Charlotte Amalie and Anthony Worley from Brazil was appointed as the twelfth member of the Auxiliary Board to foster the development of the religion for the area including the Guianas and Trinidad and Tobago. During October 1966 a trip to ten islands including Trinidad was planned by Lorraine Landau, a pioneer in Barbados who was elected to the regional national assembly.\u000aWith further pioneers and converts by 1969 there were two additional local assemblies: Arima and San Fernando, and the number of Bahá'ís had been raised to 285.\u000aCaverly returned and was living in Saint James where he and his fiancé became the first Bahá'í couple to be married in Trinidad and Tobago on August 4, 1970\u000aAmong the more notable visitors to the country were two Hands of the Cause, a select group of Bahá'ís, appointed for life, whose main function is to serve the worldwide interests of the religion. First, Ruhiyyih Khanum visited for a few days in May. The second, Enoch Olinga, visited the country for five days at the beginning of September. In October he visited the island of Tobago for a few days as well. Both met with many local and regional dignitaries as well as meeting with Bahá'ís and journalists.\u000aIn 1971 the first Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly was elected. Its members were: Ramdass Ramkissoon, Don Swihert, Joel Caverly, Dr. Lavern Johnson, Leo Fraser, Edna Ruth Caverly, Nikou Amarsingh, Shamsi Sedegat, and Fitzroy Soukoo. A count of the community then noted 27 assemblies with Bahá'ís living in 77 locations. That same year the national assembly established a correspondence course for Bahá'ís who signed up to learn more formally about their religion and had community news latter functioning.\u000a\u000aAnd a third Hand of the Cause visited in 1972 - Dr. Ugo Giachery came specifically as a representative from the Universal House of Justice, head of the religion since 1963, for its second national convention (with 17 delegates). Giachery's visit had coverage from Trinidadian newspaper and radio journalists and receptions for civic leaders. Diverse activities were then coordinated including - sending local pioneers to more localities across the country, donating several works to the national library system (Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era, Some Answered Questions, Divine Art of Living, and Paris Talks), interfaith meetings, a regular children's classes, and a regular six-minute contribution to a local radio station. The religion gained founding membership in Trinidad and Tobago's Inter-Religious Organization in 1972 lapsing only when it felt the organization was acting too political.\u000aIn 1975 the first national youth conference of the Bahá'ís of Trinidad and Tobago was held in November attended by some 70 youth followed by a national conference on the promulgation of the religion in the country with 75 attendees from most of the administrative units of the country in 1976. The first Carib Indians of Trinidad to join the religion that year. Other Iranian pioneers were known in Trinidad in 1976. Meanwhile, Bahá'ís from Trinidad and Tobago show up as visitors to Barbados in the 1960s and 70s. Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga revisited in February 1977. Around this time three district Bahá'í centers were raised up - in Sangre Grande, San Fernando and one in Tobago - in addition to the national center and a surge in conversions. In 1978 Shirin Boman, serving as a Continental Counselor of the religion, toured the country with public and private meetings and interviews. The 1981 Bahá'í Naw-Rúz, or "New Year", was observed with the presence of a number of dignitaries and an early comment by a government official on the Persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran.\u000aAn early implementation of the Ruhi Institute system occurred in 1982.\u000aIn 1983 the Bahá'ís invited national civic leaders and university professors to a special dinner and viewed a film of the testimony in the US Congress of the incidence of the persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran along with introductory materials on the religion.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Developmental projects ===\u000aSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development The Bahá'ís of Trinidad and Tobago organized an observation of the UN International Year of the Child in 1979 and Bahá'ís became formerly invited to work with one area school. An open Bahá'í Women's conference was held in 1979 with Bahá'í and non-Bahá'í women attending. A national children's conference was held in November 1980 with about 120 children plus adults and youth followed by a youth conference in December and conference on the growth of the religion in January 1981. Also in 1981 the Bahá'ís participated in an interfaith meeting at the Port of Spain town hall. Three schools in the country formally introduced classes on the religion in 1981\u20132 school year.\u000aBahá'ís continued to be active in developmental circles related to children.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Modern community ==\u000aIn the 1990s youth conferences and proclamation events, and Ruhi Institute meetings multiplied.\u000aThe national center was renovated circa 1998\u20132000. A Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Dr. Daphne Phillips, spoke at the official opening of the National Bahá'í Center in Port of Spain on 12 November 2000 addressing an audience of some 200 people.\u000aYouth, women, and minorities are among those taking the lead in becoming tutors on Ruhi Institute courses in Trinidad and Tobago since 2006.\u000aIn 2008 the Bahá\u2019í Community of Trinidad and Tobago promoted the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women through emphasizing moral education and equal partnerships between women and men.\u000aThe national library has a selection of Bahá'í literature.\u000aNewspapers have published commemorations of the founding figures of the religion. or printed quotes on occasion.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Interfaith activities ===\u000aThe federal government published a series of stamps on local religions in 1992 in honor of the Inter-Religious Organization's steadfast interfaith activities. One of them was a symbol of the Bahá'í Faith - the Ringstone symbol. Through it Bahá'ís have been a visible presence in the media. The Bahá'ís has been mentioned as part of the discussions on national policy, cross-cultural events all while visibly not receiving government aide.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Arts ===\u000aSeveral Trinidadian Bahá'ís have been visible in the arts. Musician/Music Producer Navid Lancaster is an active professional. Kathleen (Kathy) Farabi is a painter and a member of the Art Society of Trinidad & Tobago. Thunder Sowevhi is an artist, performer, dramatist and educator. Anne-Marie Brimacombe and her husband Peter Brimacombe are the Founding Directors of Arts Alive Tobago\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Demographics ===\u000aThe Bahá'ís are a small group in the country. In 2005/2010 the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 1.2% in Trinidad and Tobago - some 14\u201316,000 - were Bahá'ís. The civic census does not specify Bahá'ís as of 2011 and Bahá'ís themselves claim somewhat smaller numbers at about 10,000 and within the civic boundaries of the possible 25 locations for local assemblies there are such assemblies in 21 of them.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aCulture of Trinidad and Tobago\u000aHistory of Trinidad and Tobago\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aThe Baha'is of Trinidad and Tobago - official web site of the Trinidad and Tobago Bahá'í community

aVJohn Masey Wright (1777\u20131866) was an English watercolour-painter. He was apprenticed to the same business, but, as it proved distasteful to him, he was allowed to follow his natural inclination for art. As a boy he was given the opportunity of watching Thomas Stothard when at work in his studio, but otherwise he was self-taught. About 1810 Wright became associated with Henry Aston Barker, for whose panorama in the Strand he did much excellent work, including the battles of Coruña, Vittoria, and Waterloo.\u000aHe was also employed for a time as a scene-painter at the opera-house. But his reputation rests upon his small compositions illustrating Shakespeare and other poets, which were extremely numerous and executed with admirable taste and feeling in the manner of Stothard. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1812 to 1818, and in 1824 was elected an associate of the Watercolour Society; he became a full member in 1825, and thenceforward to the end of his long life was a regular exhibitor. His drawings were largely engraved for the \u2018Literary Souvenir,\u2019 \u2018Amulet,\u2019 \u2018Forget-me-not,\u2019 and similar publications; also for fine editions of the works of Sir Walter Scott and Burns, and for the \u2018Gallery of Modern British Artists.\u2019 Plates from his Battle of Vitoria\u2019 and \u2018The Ghost, a Christmas Frolic,\u2019 appeared in 1814, and \u2018Devotion,\u2019 a subject from Boccaccio, was engraved by Charles Heath in 1833. Though extremely industrious, Wright was poorly remunerated for his work, and during his later years received a small pension from the Watercolour Society.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal ==\u000aWright was born on Tuesday 14 Oct. 1777 at Pentonville, London, where his father was an organ-builder. He died on Sunday 13 May 1866.

aVMoog for Love is the seventh extended play recorded by British electronic music duo Disclosure, consisting of brothers Howard and Guy Lawrence. The three-track record was released on 15 June 2016, by the labels Island and PMR Records. 2016 was a year where the duo were developing their skills of writing material while on the road. Its title is named after the 1952 Eddie Jefferson song "Moody's Mood for Love". They did not have enough material to produce a full-length album, but wanted to have a record released for the summer of that year regardless. Featuring collaborations with Eats Everything and Al Green, the album garnered generally mixed to positive reviews from music critics, some calling it a significant improvement over the duo's second studio LP Caracal (2015). Upon its release, the album landed at number 80 on the Australian Singles Chart.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production ==\u000aIn 2016, Disclosure had developed their skills of writing songs while on tour, but did not have time to produce enough material for a full-length album. Regardless, the duo wanted to release a record for the summer, reasoning that they felt "strange" not issuing any material to the public in that season. Therefore, they created and distributed a three-track "clubby" extended play that went "back to the start." Moog for Love was Disclosure's first record not to feature writing contributions from Jimmy Napes, which Howard said also "feels quite strange." With the EP, Disclosure wanted to use more different track development formulas from what they used for making their previous records, Settle (2013) and Caracal (2015), reasoning that they would be making the same music over and over again if they kept making tracks the same way. However, they still had made songs in one similar way they did for Settle, in that there was some material only one of the members would work on, and after the song was finished, both members of the duo would decide if the track was ready for release and inclusion on the album.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Composition ==\u000aMoog for Love's opening cut, "Boss", written and arranged in a Los Angeles hotel room for a few days while on the road before being mixed and mastered at home, was the only song on the EP where Disclosure worked on a track together. Driven by a harsh drum loop, the song features singing from Howard Lawrence, his vocal track pitch-shifted down and filtered with EQing effects. The second track on the EP, "Feel Like I Do", is a remix of Al Green's 1972 song "I'm Still in Love with You". Guy found the song while listening to a batch of vinyl records, and when Disclosure asked Green and the track's label permission for use of samples of his recording, Green and the label enjoyed the track the duo had worked on and gave them multitrack stems of the original song for a much cleaner sound of the samples in the track. While the vocals are sped up in "Feel Like I Do," the strings, horns and electric guitar from Green's recording remain, with the addition electronic drums and "hazy effects" as Rolling Stone described. "Feel Like I Do" is the only track to not resemble the sound that was on Settle due to its slow tempo and feel.\u000aThe closing tropical house title track of Moog for Love was analyzed by a NME reviewer to borrow the rich sound that dominated Caracal while having the same tempo that was used for most tracks on Settle. He also noted that the elements of UK garage and house in "Boss" and the title song are similar to those present on tracks from Settle such as "When a Fire Starts to Burn". Instrumented with "warbled" synthesizers and a pounding bass drum, the song ends with a "hypnotising" sample of the track "Moody's Mood", sung and recorded by Brian McKnight. "Moody's Mood" is a cover of what the EP and its title track is named after, "Moody's Mood for Love". A song by Eddie Jefferson, its melody is derived from an improvised solo by jazz saxophonist James Moody. An a cappella group had written lyrics for the melody, and in the recording being sampled by the track, McKnight sings the melody and lyrics. The bassline in the track is also generated by a moog synthesizer.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Release and promotion ==\u000aOn 11 June 2016, Disclosure premiered "Boss" at the United Kingdom Wildlife Festival, leading to an estatic reception from the audience according to NME. On 14 June 2016, "Moog for Love" had a "World Record" premiere on Zane Lowe's Apple Music show Beats 1. Both songs became Annie Mac's "Hottest Record In The World" for 15 June. First available for streaming 14 June 2016, PMR and Island Records released Moog for Love for digital download the next day. The EP garnered generally positive reviews upon its distribution, some reviewers calling it significantly better than Caracal. Praising it as a less "grown-up" dance release than Caracal, Lary Bartleet of NME wrote that with Moog for Love, "Disclosure are back in the club, where they belong, but\u2026 better."\u000aWired magazine called Moog for Love one of the "6 New Albums We Demand You Listen to Immediately" only for "Feel Like I Do", calling the song "the best Avalanches song the Avalanches didn\u2019t make\u2014and the top-down, sun-kissed track you need in your life right now." Rebecca Haithcoat, who wrote a review for Pitchfork Media, had a more mixed opinion, writing that while the release garners much of the same excitements as the "expert blend of sleek pop and those big, warm and happy belted house hooks of the \u201890s" that was on Settle, it was, much like Caracal, not as good as Disclosure's debut given that it was "uninspired" and that none of the songs on the EP were "immediate or necessary." Kyle Forward of DIY magazine was also disappointed with the EP, writing that the songs were only "reminders" of their old sound rather than being something much more than "indistinct nothingness" in addition to their previous sound.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Track listing and credits ==\u000aAll tracks written, mixed, and produced by Guy Lawrence, and mastered by Lewis Hopkin; additional writing and production credits are noted.\u000aAdditional credits\u000aGus Pirelli \u2013 engineer on "Boss"\u000a\u000a\u000a== Charts ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Release history ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVIdeokinesis is an approach to improving posture, alignment, and fluency of movement through structured guided imagery that uses metaphors, such as visualizing an object moving in a specific direction along various muscle groups throughout the body, while lying completely still. Proponents claim that repeated practice of this particular formula of mental imagery translates to improved coordination in dance and in movement in general "based on the idea that imagery can improve skeletal alignment and posture through the re-patterning of neuromuscular pathways in the absence of overt movement". Although there is some evidence that rehearsal-style mental imagery may benefit performance in sports, there is currently insufficient data to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of metaphorical imagery as only personal and experimental research has been conducted on ideokinesis and there are reasons to believe it may be contraindicated as a relaxation technique.\u000aIdeokinesis was originally developed as a form of mental practice for injured dancers, but some dance schools have integrated it into a standard somatics protocol for all dancers because it is thought to optimize motor control and performance by using periods of rest constructively. Known among followers as "the Work", "ideokinesis" is sometimes used interchangeably with other terms, such as "mental practice", "mental rehearsal", "visuomotor behavior rehearsal", "covert rehearsal", and "ideokinetic facilitation", among others.\u000aMabel Todd conceived the ideokinesis approach; Barbara Clark and Lulu Sweigard, and others contributed to its early evolution; later, André Bernard, Irene Dowd, Erick Hawkins, Pamela Matt, Eric Franklin and others lent their influence.\u000aSweigard borrowed the word ideokinesis, composed by two Greek words: ideo (thought) and kinesis (movement), from Bonpensière, a piano teacher, who applied imagery to his methodology. Ideokinesis can be translated roughly as "the image or thought as facilitator of movement".\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVHoly Avenger is a Brazilian comic book series by writer Marcelo Cassaro and artist Erica Awano.\u000aA post-teenage Brazilian comic, it is set in the medieval fantasy world of Arton, part of the RPG campaign setting Tormenta.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Overview ==\u000aThe series lasted for 42 issues (40 regular ones and a 2-issue "post-end" story). Spinoffs include special issues that portray each of the main characters individually, an audio CD with voice actors playing the characters, an RPG book based on events in the series, an artbook with original sketches, and a new edition.\u000aThe English name Holy Avenger was given to the series because it can both refer to a D&D magical item and one of the main characters, the Paladin. A Portuguese name would have been gender-specific to indicate either the sword or the fighter, and thus wouldn't work the same way. In this case, the title becomes "Vingador Sagrado" (male gender) or "Vingadora Sagrada" (female gender).\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aOriginally, Holy Avenger was an adventure for a D&D game published in the RPG magazine Dragão Brasil, issues #44 to #46, in 1998. In 1999, author Marcelo Cassaro made up his own RPG setting, called "Tormenta" (Storm, referencing an extraplanar storm that afflicted the campaign setting's world). He included the Holy Avenger characters in this new RPG setting. In 1999 he teamed up with Erica Awano to start an ongoing monthly comic series.\u000aInitially, sales were unsatisfactory, but after about 10 issues the magazines took off.\u000aThe series was sent back to the newsstands through the short-lived Holy Avenger VR, which lasted only seven editions, and through Holy Avenger Reloaded, which had more pages and extra material.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000aThe plot revolves around a 19-year-old girl, Lisandra, a druid who was raised by animals on the island of Galrasia. She starts having dreams about the Paladin, a hero who mysteriously disappeared a few years ago. This Paladin had in his armour the Rubies of Virtue, twenty magical gems forged by each one of the twenty most powerful gods of the world of Arton. The gems were scattered all over the world after the Paladin's disappearance, and, according to Lisandra's dreams, it is up to her to find them and return them to the Paladin, in order to revive him.\u000aAt first, with her "cousin" (a cave wolf), she discovers that one of the rubies was in the possession of a man who was cursed into a dragon form. Unable to fight the dragon on her own, she begins a quest to find the great thief Galtran, and so she travels to the city of Valkaria. This is the first time she left her island, and she knows no other human being. So, in the city, her "cousin" draws the attention of the city guard. She explains that it means no harm and she is only looking for Galtran. The guards passing by say that everyone is looking for him. When she says that she wants to hire him, they tell her that she must come with them. The wolf fatally attacks one of the guards to protect her. For wanting to hire a thief and being responsible for the death of a city guard, she is arrested. On the same night, Sandro Galtran (son of the great thief Leon Galtran) comes to rescue Lisandra from the palace's dungeon. After escaping, they go for the Ruby.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Characters ==\u000aThe main characters of Holy Avenger are:\u000aLisandra: A 19-year-old half-dryad girl, raised by animals on the island of Galrasia. She is on a quest to reunite the 20 Rubies of Virtue to resurrect the Paladin.\u000aSandro: The son of Leon Galtran, the greatest thief of Arton. He frees Lisandra from a prison and helps her to find the Rubies. Sandro wishes to be a great thief, like his father, but he is clumsy and untalented.\u000aNiele: A busty elven mage, that dresses only with leather strips, she is famous for having saved the city of Malpetrim from a water dragon. She meets Sandro as he tries to steal her Ruby of Virtue. She ends up helping him with his hunt for the Rubies of Virtue.\u000aTork: Tork is a trog, a species of reptilian humanoid. He is very short for the standards of his race, and was abandoned by his tribe when he was a baby. He makes a living as a mercenary. He is the one who taught Lisandra to speak, use clothes, and walk on two legs. Because of this, he calls her his daughter. He ends up helping her find the Rubies of Virtue. He usually rushes headlong into battle, and has a foul mouth.\u000aThe Paladin: The Paladin was once the Paladin of Jallar, a lesser goddess, but she killed him out of jealousy. He was resurrected and joined a group of adventurers. He later had his body infused with the 20 Rubies of Virtue by one of his ex-companions, Vladislav, granting him extraordinary powers and making him a legendary hero.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aFormer Official Site, as it was on 2007-03-26.\u000aThe twenty gods of Arton - an example of Awano's work

aVAugust Adolphus Busch IV (born June 15, 1964) is an American businessman and former CEO of Anheuser-Busch. He was the last of the family to control the company, which was purchased in a hostile takeover in 2008 by InBev.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aHe is a great-great-grandson of Anheuser-Busch founder Adolphus Busch, and a great-great-great-grandson of Eberhard Anheuser who originally purchased the brewery in 1860. He is the son of Susan (Hornibrook) and August Busch III, the former chairman, president and CEO of the company.\u000aBusch's parents divorced when he was five, and he lived with his mother. His time with his father was mostly spent at the brewery and their relationship was, for the most part, professional.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Anheuser-Busch ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Early years ===\u000aAfter graduation he followed the family tradition of starting at the bottom of Anheuser-Busch. He worked as a brewing apprentice in the Old Malt House as a union member of Brewers & Maltsters Local 6 in St. Louis, Missouri, as an intern in the culture yeast center, and later as a foreman in packaging and shipping operations.\u000aIn 1989, he moved into marketing, working on the Bud Dry brand launch. Although the launch was considered a success, the product ultimately proved to be unsuccessful.\u000aBusch's father initially opposed the campaign; he later admitted "I've lost the ability to understand the 21- to 30-year-olds the way I used to."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Chairman and InBev takeover ===\u000aIn 2002, Busch (and other family members) were passed over when the company named Patrick Stokes as its first non-family president and CEO. Busch's father had said that he owns 1% of the stock and that the "board of directors calls the shots" at the company.\u000aBusch became president and CEO effective December 2006. Busch's father had been criticized for not expanding globally and leaving the company open for acquisition. In 2007, August and the directors began discussions to acquire Diageo but the deal never advanced.\u000aLess than 18 months into Busch's tenure, rumors circulated that InBev was attempting to buy the company. In April 2008, Busch told beer distributors that Anheuser-Busch would never be bought "on my watch." A-B stock had closed at $49.20 on April 30, 2008. InBev offered $65 per share in June, and Busch refused. Prior to InBev's offer, A-B's stock had never been higher than $51.97. In hopes of keeping its independence, Busch proposed acquiring the remaining 50% it did not own of Grupo Modelo. InBev then said it would not include Busch in the new company board, but would include his uncle Adolphus Busch IV, who had favored the deal. Eventually InBev sweetened its bid to $70 per share and kept Busch on the board.\u000aOn July 13, 2008, he signed off on the sale of A-B to InBev, ending 156 years of family control.\u000aPress reports indicated that the Busch family ownership of the company had greatly dwindled over the years, with Busch's father owning 1.2 percent at the time of the takeover. In total, the Busch family owned 4 percent of the company and were not the company's biggest shareholders. Barclay's owned 6 percent and Berkshire Hathaway owned 5 percent. The family did not own supervoting stock, as do many publicly traded companies with family affiliations. The board did not employ the common takeover defense tactic of staggering its board of directors terms (the A-B board was re-elected each year).\u000aAccording to reports, Busch and his father were estranged. His father was said to have engineered the A-B takeover blindsiding the son. The public conflict between father and son led to the higher price. A-B gave Busch a title of non-executive director and a contract as a consultant that ran until December 2013. He was also given a security detail through 2011.\u000aThe deal was worth $100 million to Busch. He also received a seat on InBev's board for a three-year term, $10.35 million in advance, and the promise of $120,000 a month in consultancy fees, as well as a personal security team. The same month the InBev takeover was completed, Busch resigned as a director of FedEx Corp, a position he had held since 2003.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal ==\u000aBusch holds advanced black belt degrees in the martial arts disciplines of Judo, Tae-Kwon-Do, and Hapkido. Busch, reported as a lean 5-foot-10-inch man in 2005, was described as having a striking resemblance to his father.\u000aBusch married Kathryn "Kate" Thatcher, sixteen years his junior, in August 2006 in Bradford, Vermont shortly before becoming CEO. He filed for divorce on November 26, 2008; the same month the InBev takeover was completed. The couple had a prenuptial agreement, and the divorce moved quickly through the courts, becoming official at the end of January 2009. The couple had no children.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Run-ins with the law ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Accident resulting in death of Michele Frederick (1983) ===\u000aAt age 19, while attending the University of Arizona, Busch was in an auto accident that resulted in the death of his passenger, 21-year-old Michele Frederick, a local model and waitress. According to witnesses, Busch had left a bar early one morning with Frederick. The vehicle wrecked at a 25 mph curve known for accidents. The car flipped and Frederick flew through the sunroof and was probably killed instantly when the car rolled over her. Busch left the scene of the accident without informing anyone. When police arrived on the scene hours later, they found empty Bud Light cans scattered in and around the car, along with Busch's driver's license. Police found Busch at his Tucson townhouse 4 miles (6 km) away, with blood on his body, a sawed-off shotgun, and in a dazed condition exhibiting signs of amnesia. Busch was found to have suffered a skull fracture in the accident. After a lengthy investigation by Tucson police in July 1984, the Pima County District Attorney announced he was not charging Busch with any wrongdoing. He said that while Busch appeared to have been speeding at 45 mph, that was not sufficient for charges, and witnesses from the bar did not report that he appeared to be drinking excessively.\u000aAs part of regular procedure, police took blood and urine samples from Busch while he was in custody. These samples were to assess whether and how much he had been drinking at the time of the accident. However, the hospital lost the urine sample, and the blood sample had been run through a centrifuge, rendering it useless. No one in the staff could explain what had happened. Police investigator Ron Benson said he had never before seen samples mishandled by hospital staff. Years later Benson said, "I didn't feel good about [dropping the case]. My gut told me this guy was drunk and killed this girl and I couldn't do my best for her because the [blood and urine] evidence just disappeared."\u000aWilliam Knoedelseder, who wrote a biography of the Busch family, speculated that Busch attorneys likely made a private, secret settlement with the Frederick family. August IV's mother, Susie Busch, wrote in a newspaper column that her son had not been treated justly: "there is no just treatment for families with a name and money."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Car chase (1985) ===\u000aBusch was arrested at the age of 20 in St. Louis after leading undercover police in an unmarked car on a chase with speeds reaching between 85 and 90 mph. on Kingshighway Boulevard in the Central West End of the city. He was returning from visiting PT's Sports Cabaret, a strip bar in Sauget, Illinois. The officers ended the chase by shooting out the rear tire of Busch's car. Busch claimed he thought they were attempting to kidnap him. The police accused him of trying to run over two officers with his Mercedes. Busch was acquitted of assault by a St. Louis jury.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Death of Adrienne Nicole Martin (2010) ===\u000aOn December 19, 2010, Adrienne Nicole Martin, a 27-year-old woman who had been dating Busch for about two years, was found dead at his home in Huntleigh, Missouri. A toxicology report in February 2011 indicated Martin had cocaine and oxycodone in her system. The St. Louis County Prosecutor said that Martin had lethal levels of both oxycodone and cocaine in her system, and ruled she died of an accidental overdose. Household employee Michael Jung called 9-1-1 at 1:15 p.m. Busch was in the house at the time. Martin was divorced with one child and had worked as a waitress.\u000aThe matter was investigated by Frontenac, Missouri police, who ordered toxicology tests. The incident occurred on a Sunday. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch was the first to report it four days later on a Thursday.\u000aThe initial autopsy revealed no signs of trauma and was inconclusive as to cause of death. Police reported they were investigating the case as a drug overdose. Martin's ex-husband Kevin J. Martin, a Cape Girardeau, Missouri osteopathic physician, said Martin suffered from Long QT syndrome, a heart condition that could cause an unexpected sudden death, but he had not discussed this with authorities. The physician said he had been personally called by August after the death and said he and his former wife "both think the world of August...He is a good man."  Martin's mother said that Martin was taking Trazodone for sleep issues. Kevin Martin noted such use needs to be monitored by a physician.\u000aAdrienne Martin's obituary in the Springfield News-Leader described Busch as "the love of her life." Her mother arranged for cremation after the St. Louis County Medical examiner released her daughter's body. The county's medical examiner said the cremation would not affect the investigation. Her mother said her daughter was happy with Busch.\u000aA toxicology report in February 2011 indicated Martin had cocaine and oxycodone in her system; pill bottles with her name were found containing each of these. She had no prescription for either. The St. Louis County Prosecutor said that Martin had lethal levels of both oxycodone and cocaine in her system, and ruled she died of an accidental overdose. The report noted that Martin's physical condition showed she had been using cocaine for several months to a year.\u000aOn March 31, 2011, Adrienne's ex-husband Kevin Martin filed a wrongful death suit against Busch for negligence and on behalf of her son Blake Alexander Martin (born 2003). The case was to be handled in Cape Girardeau.\u000aAdrienne's mother announced she was hiring New York attorney John Q. Kelly (who previously represented Beth Holloway and the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson) to pursue the case, and also said she would seek custody of her grandson. She was concerned that a friendship between Adrienne's ex-husband and Busch would taint the civil case. On April 6, 2011, Adrienne's father George "Larry" Eby joined the suit, saying he had been deprived of the "companionship, comfort, instruction, guidance, counsel and training of Adrienne Martin." Friends of the family noted Eby and Martin had been estranged during her adult years.\u000aOn April 20, 2011, the press reported that Busch had agreed to a $1.5 million settlement with Kevin Martin on behalf of his son. The court would decide how much could be allocated to Adrienne's parents.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Helicopter Incident ===\u000aOn July 10, 2017 Busch was arrested in Swansea, Illinois after police alleged he tried to fly a helicopter while intoxicated. According to Swansea police, officers were called around 8:15pm when Busch IV appeared to be trying to take off in his helicopter while intoxicated. He was twice administered a breathalyzer and twice blew a 0.000.  He was taken to a local hospital for blood and urine samples after officers conducted field sobriety tests, most of which Busch IV passed. Officers believed he may have been under the influence of prescription drugs.

aVRubber Racketeers is a 1942 American crime film directed by Harold Young and starring Ricardo Cortez and Rochelle Hudson.\u000aThe film was inspired by tire rationing.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot summary ==\u000aGilin is a gangster who has just gotten out of prison. One night while driving home with his girlfriend Nikki, he collides with defense workers Bill Barry and Mary Dale. Bill's tires are destroyed, and when the insurance company is unable to replace them, Nikki convinces him to exchange Bill's car for the car of Gilin's Chinese servant Tom, who has enlisted in the Army.\u000aWith government restrictions on rubber in place due to the war, Gilin goes into business stealing and re-selling good tires, then sells tires retreaded with cheap synthetic rubber to used-car lots.\u000aOne of Gilin's retreads blows out and causes the death of Mary's brother. Bill and his co-workers become determined to find the culprit behind the shoddy tires. Gilin worries that his scheme will be discovered after Bill traces a tire to his lot.\u000aNikki is pressured by Gilin to accept a date with Bill, but pretends not to be able to reach him, then secretly warns Mary of Gilin's intentions. However, Bill goes to see Nikki, intending to ask her about the tire, and falls right into Gilin's trap.\u000aGilin knocks Bill out and plans to kill him. Tom comes back from the army on leave, and refuses to help his old boss when he learns that Gilin is a war profiteer. Gilin shoots Tom and escapes with Nikki to his warehouse. Tom manages to stay alive long enough to tell Bill about what has happened. Bill calls his co-workers and the police, and they raid the warehouse en masse. During the fight, Gilin is shot by one of his own men, who is appalled that Gilin would kill Tom, a soldier.\u000aNikki goes to work at an armaments factory.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cast ==\u000aRicardo Cortez as Gilin\u000aRochelle Hudson as Nikki\u000aWilliam Henry as Bill Barry\u000aBarbara Read as Mary Dale\u000aJohn Abbott as Dumbo\u000aDick Rich as Mule\u000aDewey Robinson as Larkin\u000aSam Edwards as Freddy Dale\u000aKam Tong as Tom\u000aMilburn Stone as Angel\u000aPat Gleason as Curley\u000aAlex Callam as Butch\u000aAlan Hale Jr. as Red\u000aDick Hogan as Bert\u000aMarjorie Manners as Lila\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production ==\u000aThe film was originally called Hot Rubber. 20th Century Fox wanted to make a film with the same title.

aVMichael Edward Keenan (born October 21, 1949) is a Canadian former professional hockey coach of HC Kunlun Red Star of the Kontinental Hockey League. Previously, he served as head coach and/or General Manager with several NHL teams between 1984 and 2009. He has also worked as an analyst for the New York Rangers on MSG Network and as a hockey analyst for NBC Sports Network.\u000aKeenan won a Stanley Cup championship as coach of the New York Rangers in 1994. He also won the KHL Championship while coaching Metallurg Magnitogorsk in 2014.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Coaching career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== NHL career ===\u000aHis first coaching job was at Forest Hill Collegiate Institute in Toronto, Ontario, where he coached the varsity hockey team. In 1977 he became the coach of the Oshawa Legionaires of the Metro Junior B Hockey League, where he led them to back-to-back championships in 1979 and 1980. The following year he began his junior coaching career with the Peterborough Petes before moving on to the Rochester Americans, which he guided to the American Hockey League championship in 1983. He returned to University of Toronto to lead it to the CIAU title. He then landed his first high-profile job with the Philadelphia Flyers in 1984, then the Chicago Blackhawks in 1988. In 1993, he took the job as New York Rangers head coach, and led the franchise to its first Stanley Cup win since 1940. Prior to the 1993 season, he was also a candidate for the Detroit Red Wings head coaching job that eventually went to Scotty Bowman.\u000aThe 1994 season saw Keenan become the first to coach two different teams to a Game 7 in the Stanley Cup Finals, having previously coached the Flyers in a losing effort against the Edmonton Oilers in 1987. He was followed in this feat in 2009 by Mike Babcock of the Detroit Red Wings. In winning the 1994 Stanley Cup, Keenan managed to avoid becoming the first coach in NHL history to lose Game 7s with two different teams (the fate which would befall Babcock in losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins.).\u000aAfter leaving the Rangers Keenan went on to serve as coach and general manager of the St. Louis Blues (1994\u201396), and coached the Vancouver Canucks (1997\u201398), and the Boston Bruins (2000\u201301). He was named head coach of the Florida Panthers on December 3, 2001, before becoming its General Manager. On September 3, 2006, Keenan resigned his position and was replaced by head coach Jacques Martin.\u000aOn April 24, 2007 Keenan would take his next role as Senior Advisor to the Swedish Ice Hockey Association. This role would not last long as he was named head coach of the Calgary Flames on June 14, 2007. Keenan would go on to pass Pat Quinn for 4th on the all time NHL coach win list (648 wins) on February 12, 2009.\u000aCurrently, he is fifth all time in National Hockey League wins. Keenan's teams never missed the playoffs until 1998. His tough coaching style and attitude towards his players have earned him the nickname "Iron Mike".\u000aOn May 22, 2009, after two consecutive first round playoff losses, Keenan was fired as Head Coach of the Calgary Flames, he had one year left on his contract. He recorded his 600th win as an NHL coach with the Flames.\u000aOn Thursday, October 1, 2009, MSG Network announced Keenan would join the Rangers MSG Network broadcast team of Sam Rosen, Joe Micheletti, Al Trautwig, John Giannone, Dave Maloney, and Ron Duguay as a regular guest analyst for pre-game, intermission, and post-game reports on the network. He's also an analyst on MSG Hockey Night Live with Trautwig, Duguay, Maloney, Ken Daneyko, and Butch Goring.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Controversy ===\u000aDespite Keenan's coaching record, his inability to maintain working relationships with players and team organizations has resulted in a lack of long term coaching positions. His coaching resume includes abrupt terminations or resignations from coaching or general manager positions, sometimes at bafflingly inopportune, or peak, moments of his career.\u000aKeenan was dismissed from the Philadelphia Flyers a year after leading them to the 1987 Stanley Cup Finals. After taking the Chicago Blackhawks to the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals, Keenan was forced to focus solely on his GM duties when longtime Blackhawk player and assistant coach, Darryl Sutter, was being courted by other teams to be their head coach. Owner Bill Wirtz did not want to lose Sutter, especially since Keenan had stated, in July, 1992, that he wished to focus solely on his duties as general manager after the 92\u201393 season. Keenan lost a power struggle with Senior V.P. Bob Pulford after the 1992\u201393 season, resigned his position, and was soon hired by the New York Rangers. Keenan managed to coach the Rangers to the Stanley Cup in his first and only year as head coach, but was unable to coexist long enough with general manager Neil Smith and resigned weeks later, citing a violation of his contract by the Rangers.\u000aStops in St. Louis and Vancouver saw conflict with team stars; both Brett Hull and Trevor Linden had major personality conflicts with Keenan.\u000aIn September 2006, Keenan again attracted headlines when he abruptly resigned as general manager of the Florida Panthers. Keenan's resignation came shortly after he dealt Florida Panthers' franchise goaltender Roberto Luongo along with defenceman Lukas Krajicek and Florida's 2006 sixth-round draft pick (Sergei Shirokov) to the Vancouver Canucks for struggling forward Todd Bertuzzi, goaltender Alex Auld, and defenceman Bryan Allen. It was speculated that Keenan had lost a power struggle with head coach and longtime friend, Jacques Martin, over personnel decisions. Martin succeeded him as general manager upon his resignation.\u000aKeenan was also notorious for pulling or switching his goaltenders, sometimes multiple times in a period. In game 4 of the first round of the 1987 playoffs, Keenan pulled goaltenders, Ron Hextall and Glenn Resch, a total of five times in a single game (the fifth time to gain a man-advantage in the last minute of play).\u000aGoaltender Roberto Luongo said the following regarding Keenan's penchant for pulling his goaltenders while a member of the Florida Panthers in 2002:\u000a"Not a big deal. [Keenan] does it so much that we expect it. If he's your coach and you're an NHL goalie on the bench, you have to be ready, just in case."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== KHL career ===\u000aOn May 13, 2013 Keenan signed a contract with Metallurg Magnitogorsk of KHL. On April 30, 2014 Keenan's Metallurg team won the KHL championship with a game seven victory over HC Lev Praha. In winning the team's first Gagarin Cup, Keenan became both the first North American coach to win a KHL championship and the first coach to win both the Gagarin Cup and the Stanley Cup. On October 17, 2015, Keenan was fired by Magnitogorsk.\u000aOn March 16, 2017, Keenan was announced as the new head coach of HC Kunlun Red Star, the KHL's first Chinese based team.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Relatives ==\u000aDerek Keenan, the head coach and General Manager of the Saskatchewan Rush of the National Lacrosse League, is Keenan's third cousin.

aVRobert Gernhardt (13 December 1937 \u2013 30 June 2006) was a German writer, painter, graphic artist and poet.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aRobert Gernhardt was born the son of a judge and a chemist in Tallinn, where his family was part of the Baltic German minority. In 1939 they had to relocate to Pozna\u0144. In 1945 his father was killed in the war, and after the end of the war his mother fled west with her three sons Robert, Per and Andreas, finally ending up in Göttingen, where Robert Gernhardt finished school in 1956.\u000aAfterwards he studied painting, first in Stuttgart and then at the Hochschule der Künste in Berlin, also doing German Studies at Berlin's Freie Universität.\u000aBeginning in 1964, he lived in Frankfurt, working as a freelance artist and writer. In 1965 he married his first wife, Almut Gernhardt, née Ulrich, who died in 1989. In 1990 he married his second wife, Almut Gehebe.\u000aSince purchasing a house in Tuscany in 1972, he regularly spent many months in Italy.\u000aIn 1996 he had to undergo a multiple bypass operation and, in 2002, he was diagnosed with Colorectal cancer, which he succumbed to in 2006.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Work ==\u000aRobert Gernhardt was a regular contributor to the satirical magazine Pardon, where he edited the section Welt im Spiegel (World in the Mirror) with F. K. Waechter and F. W. Bernstein, using the pseudonym Lützel Jeman until 1971.\u000aGernhardt co-founded the satirical magazine Titanic in 1979. He is part of the so-called New Frankfurt School together with artists like F. K. Waechter, Chlodwig Poth and Hans Traxler. Gernhardt's satirical style combines social critique with a self-consciously irreverential attitude to cultural and literary traditions.\u000aHis poetry and prose are situated within the comic traditions of Wilhelm Busch, Christian Morgenstern and the urban poetry of Heinrich Heine and Bertolt Brecht. Gernhardt's poems, which frequently produce their comic effects through play with language and sound as well as through playfully quoting literary tradition, have become part of public consciousness in Germany.\u000aDuring the '70s and '80s, he wrote material for Otto Waalkes, one of Germany's most popular comedians. A lot of Waalkes' most famous routines were written by Gernhardt.\u000aIn 2006, shortly before his death, he was the Writer in Residence at the German department of the University of Warwick.\u000aHe died on 30 June 2006 in Frankfurt on Main, after a long fight against cancer, aged 68.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Awards ==\u000aHe won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis in 1983 and the Kassel Literary Prize in 1991.

aVThe New Wineskins Association of Churches (NWAC) was a group of nearly 200 theologically conservative Presbyterian churches, each of which is in varying stages of departing from the mainline Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), also known as PC(USA). The New Wineskins network of churches was formed as a result of growing discontent among theologically conservative pastors, elders, and members regarding the general direction of the PC(USA). The NWAC was scheduled to come to a conclusion in June 2012. The New Wineskins Presbytery was dissolved in 2011, as its mission was completed.\u000aSome churches have fully departed from the PC(USA), others are in process of leaving, and still others intend to stay within the PC(USA). As of now, nearly 40 individual churches have formed the New Wineskins Presbytery, a non-geographic presbytery opened up by the more conservative Evangelical Presbyterian Church (EPC).\u000aThe co-moderators of the New Wineskins Association as of 2012 were Dean Weaver and Rev. Gerrit Dawson. The NWAC maintains headquarters in Allison Park, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Background ==\u000aReasons for the discontent leading to this possible separation include, but are not limited to:\u000ageneral discontent with the PC(USA)'s decisions on issues such as homosexuality and abortion\u000agrowing dissatisfaction with the PC(USA)'s interpretation and enforcement of its constitution and\u000athe recent reception of documents such as the PUP (Peace, Unity, and Purity) Report at the 2006 General Assembly which asserted that it is up to the ordaining body to determine whether a candidate meets current ordination standards, even though they cannot set aside any constitutional standards.\u000aSome in the New Wineskins movement believe that this created a constitutional loophole for persons engaged in sexual activity outside of marriage to become ordained by a sort of "local option" which allows them to declare a scruple against the stated constitution.\u000aAnother recent document that was received by the PC(USA)'s General Assembly was a report entitled "The Trinity: God's Love Overflowing". This document, which is more familiarly known as the "Trinity Report," suggested that the terms "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit" may be supplemented (although not replaced) by other language, including such formulations as "Speaker, Word and Breath" and "Fire that Consumes, Sword that Divides, and Storm that Melts Mountains". The NWAC considers both of these documents to be in error in several places.\u000aThe New Wineskins movement believes that such declarations are a departure from the PC(USA)'s historic grounding in biblical theology and its own Reformed confessions. The New Wineskins Association of Churches has crafted a constitution that emphasizes local church ministry as opposed to denominational hierarchy, and consists of specific theological essentials of the reformed faith as well as ethical imperatives.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe NWAC held its third convocation in February 2007, where it considered its future relationship with the PC(USA). At this meeting, the NWAC unanimously voted to petition the EPC to create a non-geographic, transitional New Wineskins presbytery (NWEPC) for those churches wishing to leave the PC(USA). The EPC voted overwhelmingly to form the new presbytery at its own General Assembly in June 2007 with the expectation that the New Wineskins congregations would be received into the EPC.\u000aAs of December 2007, many of the congregations that comprise the NWAC were still officially affiliated with the PC(USA), but it was expected that those congregations that would formally separate from that church and join the Evangelical Presbyterian Church (EPC), by joining the New Wineskins Presbytery (NWEPC) which met for the first time in October 2007.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVIn nanotechnology, a carbon nanobud is a material that combines carbon nanotubes and spheroidal fullerenes, both allotropes of carbon, in the same structure, forming "buds" attached to the tubes. Carbon nanobuds were discovered and synthesized in 2006.\u000aIn this new material, fullerenes are covalently bonded to the outer sidewalls of the underlying nanotube. Consequently, nanobuds exhibit properties of both carbon nanotubes and fullerenes. For instance, the mechanical properties and the electrical conductivity of the nanobuds are similar to those of corresponding carbon nanotubes. However, because of the higher reactivity of the attached fullerene molecules, the hybrid material can be further functionalized through known fullerene chemistry. Additionally, the attached fullerene molecules can be used as molecular anchors to prevent slipping of the nanotubes in various composite materials, thus modifying the composite\u2019s mechanical properties.\u000aOwing to the large number of highly curved fullerene surfaces acting as electron emission sites on conductive carbon nanotubes, nanobuds possess advantageous field electron emission characteristics. Randomly oriented nanobuds have already been demonstrated to have an extremely low work function for field electron emission. Reported test measurements show (macroscopic) field thresholds of about 0.65 V/\u03bcm, (non-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes have a macroscopic field threshold for field electron emission ~2 V/\u03bcm) and a much higher current density as compared with that of the corresponding pure single-walled carbon nanotubes. The electron transport properties of certain nanobud classes have been treated theoretically. The study shows that electrons indeed pass to the neck and bud region of the nanobud system.\u000aCanatu Oy, a Finnish company, claims the intellectual property rights for nanobud material, its synthesis processes, and several applications.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Properties ==\u000aCarbon nanobuds (CNBs) have some properties of nanotubes such as one-dimensional electrical conductivity, flexibility and adaptability to manufacture while also having some chemical properties of fullerenes. Examples of these properties include engaging in cycloaddition reactions and can easily form the chemical bonds capable of attaching to other molecules with complex structures. CNBs have a much higher chemical activity than single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs).\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Electrical Properties ===\u000aThis new structure has been shown to have electronic properties that differ from those of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNBs exhibit lower field thresholds and higher current densities and electric field emission than SWCNTs. The chemical bonds between the nanotube's wall and the fullerenes on the surface can lead to charge transfer between the surfaces. The presence of fullerenes in CNBs lead to smaller bundle formation and larger chemical reactivity. CNBs can engage in cycloaddiiton reactions and easily form the chemical bonds capable of attaching molecules with complex structures. this can be explained by a greater availability of CNB surface to the reactants the presence of \u03c0-conjugated structures, and having 5-atom rings with excess pirimidization energy. Formation energy indicated that preparation of CNBs is endothermic, meaning that its not favorable to create.\u000aAll CNBs are conducting, regardless of whether the single walled CNT is a metallic or semiconducting base. The band gap of carbon nanobuds is not constant, it can change through the size of the fullerene group. The attachment of C60 added to the armchair orientation of the SWCNT opens up the band gap. On the other hand, adding it to a semiconducting SWCNT could introduce impurity states to the band gap, which would reduce the band gap. The band gap of CNBs can also be modified by changing the density of the carbons of the C60 attached to the sidewall of the SWCNT.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Magnetic Properties ===\u000aGeometrical factors are integral to study the magnetic properties of nanobuds. There are two structures of CNBs that are ferromagnetic in their ground state, and two that are nonmagnetic. The attached C60 molecule on the surface of the CNTs gives more space between the nanotubes and adhesion between the single walled CNTS can be weakened to prevent the formation of tight bundles of CNTs. Carbon nanobuds can be used as molecular support to prevent slipping of the matrix in composite materials and to increase the mechanical strength of them.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Structural Properties ===\u000aThe stability of CNBs is dependent on the type of carbon-carbon bond that is dissociated in the cycloaddition reaction. It has been shown that carbon atoms of the SWCNT near the fullerene C60 molecule were pulled outward from the original wall surface due to the covalent bonding with cycloaddition reaction between the fullerene and nanotube; in addition, their bonding was transformed from sp2to sp3 hybridization. An analysis using Raman scattering spectroscopy shows that the CNB sample had stronger chemical modification compared to CNTs. This indicates that there is a carbon sp3 hybridization that occurs after the chemical addition creation of CNBs.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Synthesis ==\u000aThe single wall carbon nanotubes, SWCNTs, are capable of being covered with covalently bonded fullerenes (a specific type of spheroidal carbon). This was able to occur when water vapor or carbon dioxide concentrations were instituted into the reactor. This occurrence produces a material that looks similar to buds that are on a tree branch. Therefore, this is the reasoning behind the term, nanobud, being chosen for the material.\u000aThe vapor concentrations for the water and the density of the fullerenes were looked into with a lot more detail. At 45 ppm and higher, the nanobuds began to be formed in abundance. However, when the concentration for the water that was added was about 365 ppm, something different happened. Rather than being a significant amount of nanobuds, it contained a large amount of inactive catalyst particles.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Characterization ==\u000aThere are multiple methods that were used in order to discover the fullerenes on the single wall carbon nanotube surfaces, each giving its own contribution to what is currently known about nanobuds. A few of these methods are ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).\u000aTo look even further into the functionality of CNBs and how the single wall carbon nanotubes interact with the fullerenes to produce the nanobuds, calculations were done. The calculations that were done came from the atomistic density functional theory (quantum mechanical modelling method) and gave quite a bit of information about the bonding that is taking place. They told the scientists that there seem to be two possibilities for the interaction. One of the possibilities is that the fullerenes can be covalently bonded to the single wall carbon nanotubes directly. The other possibility is that the fullerenes are forming hybrid structures.\u000aRegardless of how they are bonding to the single wall nanotubes, studies have shown that the fullerenes are stationary and do not seem to want to move from the interaction with the nanotubes, concluding that the bond they have is very strong. This study was done using transmission electron microscopy.\u000aAnother study was done to see how washing the nanobuds in different solvents, such as toluene, decaline, and hexane, would affect the fullerenes and their interaction with the nanotubes. Of the solvents that were tested, none of them resulted in fullerenes being dissolved in the solvent. This continues to defend the discovery that the bond between the two is significantly strong. In one more additional study that was done, it was discovered that each of the nanobud samples contained oxygen.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Applications ==\u000aThe research, development, and manufacture of flexible and transparent electronics relies on novel materials, or materials which are mechanically flexible, lightweight and relatively low cost. These materials must also be conductive and optically transparent. Due to their close relation to the carbon nanotube family, carbon NanoBuds offer all of those traits, as well as more due to their inclusion of fullerene.\u000aEsko Kauppinen, a professor and researcher at the Helsinki University of Technology and the technology development organization VTT Biotechnology, and his team found that carbon NanoBuds have properties that are often associated with cold electron field emitters. Such materials emit electrons at room temperature under a high applied electric field, a property that is very important with regard to technologies such as flat-panel displays and electron microscopes. Carbon NanoBuds can be much more effective than flat surfaces with respect to how efficiently they can emit electrons. This is due to the many curved surfaces of both the fullerene and the carbon nanotube that make up the carbon NanoBud.\u000aAs a result of the curvature of the fullerenes and the nanotubes, almost any surface could potentially be transformed into a surface with touch sensing ability. Canatu, a company which specializes in electronic carbon NanoBud products, claims that the films that result from the synthesis of the NanoBuds are very rugged and flexible. They also claim that the NanoBuds allow for easy application to flexible and curved surfaces. NanoBuds are able to maintain their electronic capabilities while being bent up to 200 percent. This property is a result of the rounded surfaces, which allow the NanoBuds to slide past each other without damaging the electronic structure of the material. Typically, touch screen surfaces are made by placing a sheet of indium tin oxide, also a transparent film, over a display screen. However, indium tin oxide sheets are very brittle like glass and can only be applied to relatively flat surfaces in order to maintain the integrity of the structure.\u000aAs a result of their close lineage with carbon nanotubes, NanoBuds have a tunable electrical conductivity. Since the electrical properties of the NanoBuds can be individually tuned (provided that single wall nanotubes with distinct regions of different electrical properties are a part of the NanoBud), according to Esko Kauppinen and his team, it is entirely possible that NanoBuds may at some point be used in applications such as memory storage devices and quantum dots. The Kauppinen team argues that the conductivity of the crystalline carbon structure allow for this application. In fact, the small size of carbon nanotubes and carbon NanoBuds, in theory, allow for a very high density of energy storage. The most common memory technology that is associated with carbon NanoBuds is Nano random-access memory (NRAM), or Nano-RAM. Its developing company Nantero gave it this common name. This technology is a type of nonvolatile random access memory, but it is based on the position of carbon nanotubes, or in this case, carbon NanoBuds on a chip like substrate. Its developing company Nantero give it its common name, NRAM. When compared to other forms of nonvolatile random access memory, NanoRAM has several advantages, but one really stands out. NRAM is believed to be within a variety of new memory systems, a variety which many people believe to be universal. Nantero claims that Nano-RAM (NRAM) could eventually replace almost all memory systems from flash to DRAM to SRAM.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aNanobud\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe 152 mm /55 Model 1934\u20131936 were built for the Italian Navy in the years before World War II. These guns were used on the Duca degli Abruzzi-class Light cruisers, which were the final series of the Condottieri-class cruisers as their primary armament and as secondary armament on the Littorio-class battleships.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Construction ==\u000aThe Model 1934 was designed and manufactured by Ansaldo, while the Model 1936 was manufactured by OTO Melara. The Model 1934's made by Ansaldo were of monobloc construction with a horizontal sliding breech block, while the Model 1936's made by OTO Melara were constructed of two tubes, a loose liner and a horizontal sliding breech block. Both models fired the same quick firing separate loading ammunition. The gun mounts had electrically powered training, elevation and hoists. There were telescopic pneumatic rammers and each gun had a separate cradle. Loading was at any angle up to +20° for both the twin and triple mounts. These guns were considered a significant improvement over the earlier 152 mm /53 Models 1926 and 1929 guns in that they had a lower muzzle velocity, were more widely spaced in the turrets and had separate gun cradles. Dispersion was still a problem, but the problem wasn't inherent flaws in the guns or their mounts. Instead poor shell aerodynamics and poor ammunition quality control was at fault.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Naval Service ==\u000aAnsaldo Model 1934 guns were mounted triple wing turrets on the Littorio, and in triple and twin superfiring turrets forward and aft on the Duca degli Abruzzi-class.

aVRené Marc Jalbert,  (20 February 1921 \u2013 21 January 1996) was a Canadian soldier and sergeant-at-arms of the National Assembly of Quebec, known for his role in ending Denis Lortie's killing spree in the Parliament Building on 8 May 1984.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Military career ==\u000aJalbert served in World War II and the Korean War, attaining the rank of major in the Royal 22e Régiment.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sergeant-at-Arms ==\u000aAfter his military career, he served as sergeant-at-arms in the National Assembly of Quebec.\u000aOn 8 May 1984, Denis Lortie entered the Parliament Building in the morning, before government business had begun, and killed three government employees on his way to the Assembly Chamber. Upon learning of Lortie's presence, Jalbert entered the Assembly Chamber. Seeing Lortie in uniform, Jalbert showed the gunman his identification as a war veteran from the same regiment as Lortie, opening a dialogue with him. Jalbert convinced Lortie to allow several employees to leave the premises. Then he invited Lortie into his downstairs office to discuss the situation, in effect setting himself up as hostage while removing Lortie from the scene. At extreme personal risk, Jalbert spent four hours persuading Lortie to surrender to police.\u000aJalbert's actions almost certainly prevented a higher death toll. For his bravery, Jalbert was awarded the Cross of Valour, Canada's highest civilian award for bravery, which was presented to him 9 November 1984, by Governor General Jeanne Sauvé in a ceremony at Rideau Hall, Ottawa.\u000aThe award citation reads:\u000a\u000aIn a rare display of coolheadedness and courage, René Jalbert, Sergeant-at-Arms at the Quebec National Assembly, subdued a man who had killed three people and wounded thirteen more on the morning of 8 May 1984. The man had entered a side door of the National Assembly building and immediately opened fire with a submachine-gun; moments later he climbed the main staircase toward the assembly chamber, known as the Blue Room, shooting repeatedly, and then burst into the chamber. As bullets peppered the wall, Mr. Jalbert entered the Blue Room and with icy calm convinced the man to allow several employees to leave the premises. Then he invited the heavily armed man into his downstairs office, in effect setting himself up as hostage while removing the man from the scene. At extreme personal risk, but with unflinching authority, Mr. Jalbert spent four hours persuading the man to surrender to police. The audacity of this retired Major of the Royal 22nd Regiment, a Second World War and Korean War veteran, almost certainly prevented a higher death toll.\u000a\u000aIn 2006 a street in Quebec City was named after René Jalbert:\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVGraham Jackson (15 February 1967 \u2013 23 July 2012) was a British conductor.\u000aBorn in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, Jackson learned the clarinet, piano and bassoon as a youth, and served as first bassoon in the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge from 1985 to 1988 as organ scholar, receiving a double first in music and mathematics. Jackson then gained a scholarship to study conducting for three years at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. Having concluded his studies, in 1992 he joined Welsh National Opera as chorus master, repetiteur and conductor. He soon earned a reputation for his prodigious keyboard skills and his ability to conduct whole scores from memory, a habit that would stay with him for the rest of his life.\u000aFrom 2000 to 2003, Jackson was "Kapellmeister" (principal conductor) at the Theater Bremen, where at a week's notice he took over the new production of Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk to critical acclaim. He became "Generalmusikdirektor" (Director of Music) of the Theater Krefeld and Mönchengladbach in 2003.  He concluded his tenure in this post in early July 2012, just over a fortnight before his death from cancer. His final concert was a performance of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, conducted against the advice of his doctor.\u000aHis work in contemporary music included conducting premieres of works by François Sarhan, Charlotte Seither, Stefan Heucke and Sidney Corbett. He felt that his finest achievement was the première of Heuke's work Das Frauenorchester von Auschwitz, an opera that tells how female prisoners at the concentration camp made music together under the direction of Alma Rosé, Mahler's niece.

Its parent company was 17th in the list of the largest candy companies in the world, with sales amounting to $1.196 billion.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aKrasny Oktyabr was founded by Theodor Ferdinand von Einem. Von Einem sold his stake in the enterprise to Julius Heuss, who became its director in 1878, retaining the position until his death in 1907. In 1896, the Einem factory won a gold medal at the All-Russian Industrial and Artistic Exhibition, and it was allowed to supply confectionery to the court of the tsar.\u000aAt the turn of the 20th century, the Einem factory won chocolatiers' competitions across Europe, and its advertising was displayed prominently in Moscow. After the October Revolution of 1917, the company was nationalised and given its current name. During World War II, the factory reoriented its production towards the manufacturing of military rations, including high-caffeine chocolate.\u000aAfter the fall of the Soviet regime, the company continued to use the Krasny Oktyabr name for its brand recognition, but it began to decorate the boxes and labels with Tsarist-era motifs. Krasny Oktyabr was privatised in 1993. In the 1990s, it became one of the few large business concerns in Moscow to be privatised successfully. At the same time, it had to compete with foreign companies such as Mars Inc.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Alyonka ==\u000aProduced since 1965, this is one of the most famous chocolate bars from the Krasny Oktyabr factory. Today, they are still just as popular as when they just arrived on the market. Alyonka can be described as a long thin bar of chocolate weighing 100 grams. The bar is subdivided into 3x5 tiles, each of which has the name of the factory imprinted on it in Russian - «\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c».\u000aThe wrapper depicts a blue-eyed girl wearing a traditional Russian head scarf, who is presumably "Alyonka", an endearing form of the name Alyona. The illustration is based on a photograph of the daughter of one of the artists working at the factory. Though many women have claimed to have been the famous child, the company denies that the image was based on a real girl.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Former plant ==\u000a\u000aThe production site of Krasny Oktyabr was formerly located on the Moskva River embankment, a couple of kilometres from the Kremlin.

aVThe Youghiogheny River , or the Yough  for short, is a 134-mile-long (216 km) tributary of the Monongahela River in the U.S. states of West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. It drains an area on the west side of the Allegheny Mountains northward into Pennsylvania, providing a small watershed in extreme western Maryland into the tributaries of the Mississippi River. Youghiogheny is a Lenape word meaning "a stream flowing in a contrary direction".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geography ==\u000aThe Youghiogheny rises in northern West Virginia, in Preston County southeast of the town of Aurora and near Backbone Mountain. The headwaters are approximately 10 miles (16 km) north of the headwaters of the North Branch of the Potomac River and pass through Silver Lake before flowing north-northeast into Garrett County, Maryland, then flowing north past Oakland and roughly parallel to the West Virginia border, separated by approximately 3 miles (5 km). The river enters southwestern Pennsylvania on the border between Fayette and Somerset counties. It flows northwest through a gap in Chestnut Ridge and then past Connellsville. It joins the Monongahela River from the southeast at McKeesport, southeast of Pittsburgh.\u000aUpstream from Confluence, Pennsylvania, approximately 6 miles (9.7 km) north of Pennsylvania border, the river is impounded by the 184-foot-high (56 m) Youghiogheny Dam to form the Youghiogheny River Lake, a reservoir that stretches upstream into northern Maryland. The dam was completed in 1944 primarily for flood control.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aIn the colonial era and in the early United States, the valley of the river provided an important route of access through the mountains for settlers and military forces from Virginia to western Pennsylvania and the Ohio Country. In 1754, as a militia officer of the British Colony of Virginia, George Washington followed the river in an attempt to find a water route to Fort Duquesne, then held by the French.\u000aDuring the uncommonly severe winter of 1787-88, American pioneers to the Northwest Territory departed New England and cut trails westward through the mountains. At Sumrill\u2019s Ferry, present-day West Newton, Pennsylvania, on the Youghiogheny River, the men built flatboats which carried them down the Youghiogheny River to the Monongahela River, and then to the Ohio River, and onward to the Northwest Territory.\u000aThe pioneer town of Somerfield, Pennsylvania, was inundated by the building of the Youghiogheny Dam. Perryopolis in northern Fayette County, Pennsylvania, is the site of the George Washington Grist Mill. The Youghiogheny River Trail follows the river in southwestern Pennsylvania southeast of Connellsville.\u000aCoal mining became an important industry along the lower Youghiogheny River during the 19th century. At the time the name was often spelled Yohoghany (or variants thereof), and during the 1860s and 1870s that spelling was used as the name of a post office near what is now Shaner in Westmoreland County.\u000aFallingwater, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, is located in the river valley southeast of Connellsville.\u000aA portion of the river in Maryland has been set aside by the state as the Youghiogheny Scenic and Wild River.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Recreation ==\u000aThe Youghiogheny is popular for whitewater canoeing, kayaking and rafting. Three sections of the river, varying in difficulty, are available on a predictable basis for whitewater recreation:\u000aTop Yough, near Swallow Falls State Park in Maryland (Class IV-V)\u000aUpper Yough, from Sang Run to Friendsville, Maryland (Class IV-V)\u000aMiddle Yough, from Confluence, Pennsylvania to Ohiopyle (Class II)\u000aOhiopyle Falls in Ohiopyle State Park: Previously, this spectacular 18-foot (5.5 m) waterfall was legal for kayakers and canoeists to run on only one weekend a year (Class IV), during a race and festival. During August 2010, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources announced a pilot program allowing boaters to run the falls during three weeks from Sunday, August 22, 2010, through Sunday, September 12, 2010.

At least five, and possibly as many as 14, of the fatalities have occurred at a rapid within the Lower Yough known as Dimple. Dimple refers to both the Class III rapid by that name, as well as an undercut rock in the middle of the rapid by that name.

aVSpeusippus (; Greek: \u03a3\u03c0\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2; c. 408 \u2013 339/8 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher. Speusippus was Plato's nephew by his sister Potone. After Plato's death, Speusippus inherited the Academy and remained its head for the next eight years. However, following a stroke, he passed the chair to Xenocrates. Although the successor to Plato in the Academy, he frequently diverged from Plato's teachings. He rejected Plato's Theory of Forms, and whereas Plato had identified the Good with the ultimate principle, Speusippus maintained that the Good was merely secondary. He also argued that it is impossible to have satisfactory knowledge of any thing without knowing all the differences by which it is separated from everything else.\u000aThe standard edition of the surviving fragments and testimonies is Leonardo Tarán's Speusippus of Athens: A Critical Study with a Collection of the Related Texts and Commentary (1982).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aSpeusippus was a native of Athens, and the son of Eurymedon and Potone, a sister of Plato. The pseudonymous Thirteenth Letter of Plato claims that Speusippus married his niece (his mother's granddaughter). We hear nothing of his life until the time when he accompanied his uncle Plato on his third journey to Syracuse, where he displayed considerable ability and prudence, especially in his amicable relations with Dion. His moral worth is recognised even by Timon, though only that he may heap the more unsparing ridicule on his intellect.\u000aThe report about his sudden fits of anger, his greed, and his debauchery, are probably derived from a very impure source: Athenaeus and Diogenes Laërtius can adduce as authority for them scarcely anything more than the abuse in some spurious letters of Dionysius the Younger, who was banished by Dion, with the cooperation of Speusippus. Having been selected by Plato as his successor as the leader (scholarch) of the Academy, he was at the head of the school for only eight years (348/7\u2013339/8 BC). He died, it appears, of a lingering paralytic illness, presumably a stroke. He was succeeded as the head of the school by Xenocrates.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Philosophy ==\u000aDiogenes Laërtius gives us a list of some of the titles of the many dialogues and commentaries of Speusippus, which is of little help in determining their contents, and the fragments provided by other writers provide us with only a little extra.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Epistemology ===\u000aSpeusippus was interested in bringing together those things which were similar in their philosophical treatment, and to the derivation, and laying down, of the ideas of genera and species: for he was interested in what the various sciences had in common, and how they might be connected. Thus he furthered the threefold division of philosophy into Dialectics, Ethics, and Physics, for which Plato had laid the foundation, without losing sight of the mutual connection of these three branches of philosophy. For he maintained that no one could arrive at a complete definition who did not know all the differences by which a thing which was to be defined was separated from the rest.\u000aWith Plato, moreover, he distinguished between that which is the object of thought, and that which is the object of sensuous perception, between the cognition of the reason and sensuous perception. He tried, however, to show how perception can be taken up and transformed into knowledge, by the assumption of a perception, which, by participation in rational truth, raises itself to the rank of knowledge. By this he seems to have understood an immediate, (in the first instance aesthetic), mode of conception; since he appealed, in support of this view, to the consideration that artistic skill has its foundation not in sensuous activity, but in an unerring power of distinguishing between its objects, that is, in a rational perception of them.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Metaphysics ===\u000aSpeusippus rejected Plato's Theory of Forms; whereas Plato distinguished between ideal numbers (i.e. the Platonic Forms of numbers) and mathematical numbers, Speusippus rejected the ideal numbers, and consequently the ideas. He tried to determine the idea of substance more distinctly by separating its types, the difference between which he considered would result from the difference between the principles (archai) on which they are based. Thus he distinguished substances of number, of size, of soul, while Plato had referred them, as separate entities, to the ideal numbers.\u000a\u000aSpeusippus made still more kinds of substance, beginning with the One, and assuming principles for each kind of substance, one for numbers, another for spatial magnitudes, and then another for the soul; and by going on in this way he multiplies the kinds of substance.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, Speusippus also must have recognised something common in those different kinds of substances, inasmuch as, firstly, he set out from the absolute One, and regarded it as a formal principle which they had in common, and, secondly, he appears to have assumed that multitude and multiformity was a common primary element in their composition. But it is only the difficulties which led him to make this and similar deviations from the Platonist doctrine, of which we can get any clear idea, not the way in which he thought he had avoided those difficulties by distinguishing different kinds of principles. The criticism of Aristotle, directed apparently against Speusippus, shows how little satisfied he was with the modification of the original Platonist doctrine.\u000aWith this deviation from Plato's doctrine is connected another which takes a wider range. As the ultimate principle, Speusippus would not, with Plato, recognise the Good, but, with others, (who doubtless were also Platonists), going back to the older Theologi, maintained that the principles of the universe were to be set down as causes of the good and perfect, but were not the good and perfect itself, which must rather be regarded as the result of generated existence, or development, just as the seeds of plants and animals are not the fully formed plants or animals themselves.\u000a\u000aSpeusippus [supposes] that supreme beauty and goodness are not present in the beginning, because the beginnings both of plants and of animals are causes, but beauty and completeness are in the effects of these.\u000a\u000aThe ultimate principle he designated, like Plato, as the absolute One, but it was not to be regarded as an existing entity, since all entities can only be the result of development. When, however, with the Pythagoreans, he reckoned the One in the series of good things, he probably conceived it only in its opposition to the Many, and wished to indicate that it was from the One and not from the Many, that the good and perfect is to be derived. Nevertheless, Speusippus seems to have attributed vital activity to the primordial Unity, as inseparably belonging to it, probably in order to explain how it could grow, by a process of self-development, into the good, spirit, etc.; for spirit also he distinguished from the one, as well as from the good; and the good from pleasure and pain. Less worthy of notice is the attempt by Speusippus to find a more suitable expression for the material principle, the indefinite duality of Plato; and his Pythagorizing mode of treating the doctrine of numbers which we can see in the extracts of his treatise on the Pythagorean numbers.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ethics ===\u000a\u000aDiogenes Laertius' list of Speusippus' works includes titles on justice, friendship, pleasure, and wealth. Clement of Alexandria (fr. 77 Tarán) reports that Speusippus considered happiness to be "a state that is complete in those things that are in accordance with nature, a condition desired by all human beings, while the good aim at freedom from disturbance; and the virtues would be productive of happiness." This testimony suggests that Speusippus' ethics may have been an important background to ethical ideas of the Stoics (the will's conformity with nature) and Epicureans (compare "freedom from disturbance," aochl\u0113sia, with the notion of ataraxia).\u000aModern scholars have detected a polemic between Speusippus and Eudoxus of Cnidus concerning the good. Eudoxus also accepts that the good will be that at which all people aim, but identifies this as pleasure, as opposed to Speusippus' exclusive focus on moral goods. Texts of Aristotle and Aulus Gellius suggest that Speusippus insisted that pleasure was not a good, but that the good was "in between the opposites of pleasure and pain." It is possible that the dispute between Speusippus and Eudoxus influenced Plato's Philebus (esp. 53c\u201355a).\u000aSpeusippus also seems to have developed further Plato's ideas of justice and of the citizen, and the fundamental principles of legislation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aPlato's unwritten doctrines, for debates in the Early Academy over Plato's esotericism\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aDorandi, Tiziano (1999).

Suddenly their lives are thrown into chaos by the sudden appearance of the Great Crystal Triangle, a dark omen from the heavens appearing once every 10,000,000 years.\u000aKoichiro at first wishes to simply ignore the harbinger of doom, but is motivated to action by "The Old Man of Hakodate" a shamanistic soothsayer that lives in the dump and gives wisdom to all that seek it. Joined by Isao Murakami, a young delinquent fresh out of juvenile hall, the two set off on an epic journey across South Brunswick city park, to obtain the last shard of the crystal triangle from the great monster Ginji Iwagami, a mutated albino alligator that lives in the sewers. The two manage to bring down the monster, but Isao's soul is trapped within the shard, leaving his body as little more than a mouthpiece for the will of the Crystal Triangle.\u000aKoichiro begs the old man of Hakodate for a way to save Isao, who presents him with the terrible choice, Surrender the last Shard back to the triangle, releasing Isao's soul, but also returning the Triangle to its complete, immortal state, or kill Isao himself, thus preventing the Crystal Triangle from ever being completed, saving the rest of civilization from the terrible doom it represents. As the final hour grows closer and closer, Koichiro is forced to weigh the uncertain fate of many against the definite fate of one.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cast ==\u000aMasane Tsukayama: Koichiro Kamishiro\u000aToshiko Fujita: Juno Cassidy\u000aYusaku Yara: Grigori Yefimovich / Urga\u000aYuriko Yamamoto: Miyabi Koto / Himiko\u000aKazuki Yao: Isao Murakami\u000aMayumi Sho: Mina Katsuki\u000aIchiro Nagai: Kukai\u000aSeizo Kato: The Old Man of Hakodate\u000aYuzuru Fujimoto: Hih Tribe Priest\u000aNorio Wakamoto: Ginji Iwagami\u000aKan Tokumaru: Yoshioka\u000aBanjo Ginga: Dàrén\u000aIssei Futamata: Genpo\u000aShinya Otaki: Numata\u000aYuji Mikimoto: Ubanishad Master\u000aMichitaka Kobayashi: Minato\u000aMasaru Ikeda: Narrator\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production ==\u000aToyoo Ashida and Kazuko Tadano were character designers in the OVA.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aCrystal Triangle (anime) at Anime News Network's encyclopedia

aVVertrue Incorporated, headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, is an American consumer services marketing company. The company again received an "F" from the Better Business Bureau for making unauthorized charges to its customers' credit cards. In 2007 it was acquired by a trio of investment firms, including Rho Ventures. In 2010, Vertrue and two of its subsidiaries were found guilty of defrauding nearly 500,000 of their customers in Iowa.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Organization ==\u000aIn the annual report, submitted to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, in November 2006 the President and Chief Executive Officer of Vertrue is listed as Gary Johnson.\u000aVertrue have a European division called Adaptive Affinity, based in Edgware UK, and led by Andrew Millet. They have a number of brands in Europe including VP Rewards, Premier Club and highstreetmax.com. In America, one of their brands is MVQ SavingsAce. All of the brands specialise in positive option selling, where customers of other companies, for example Amazon.co.uk or Lastminute.com find that by not un-clicking a box during a transaction they will be signed up and billed for the memberships which is stated in the terms and conditions. The branch agreed to change its sign-up methods in June 2009. Adaptive Affinity Ltd began a process of attempting to force the removal of negative comments from their customers, by posting legal letters to a number of websites in September 2010. \u000a\u000a\u000a== Lawsuits ==\u000aVertrue faced a class action lawsuit at the Middle District Court of Tennessee in which Margaret Wike claimed that Vertrue violated federal law by enrolling her in a discount club and charging a monthly fee to her debit card. The district court granted summary judgment for Vertrue, concluding that EFTA\u2019s one-year limitations period barred Wike\u2019s claim. Wike sought leave to add RICO claims to her complaint, alleging that Vertrue had ensnared Wike and \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of other consumers in a deceptive marketing scheme. The district court denied Wike\u2019s request, concluding that the proposed amendment would be futile because Wike could not show she was injured \u201cby reason of\u201d Vertrue\u2019s alleged racketeering activity, 18 U.S.C. § 1964. Wike appealed both rulings and prevailed on the summary judgment ruling but the appeals court decided not to rule on the failure to provide leave to amend complaint to include racketeering charges.\u000aOn behalf of Iowa, state attorney general Tom Miller sued the company in May 2006, saying it was signing up customers in a way that violated Iowa's Buying Club Memberships Law. According to a report posted by the Better Business Bureau, Vertrue was ordered to pay "$30 million dollars in restitution, penalties and costs after ruling the corporation violated Iowa's buying club law and used deceptive and unfair practices to market so-called buying club memberships to nearly a half-million Iowans over the last twenty years."\u000aVertrue has sued the Wikimedia Foundation in 2008 in Connecticut over the contents of the article on the company in Wikipedia.\u000aThe lawsuit against Vertrue, Inc. reached the Iowa Supreme Court in 2013. The lawsuit was upheld in a 6-0 ruling. Chief Justice Mark Cady wrote that the company\u2019s practices were confusing for all consumers and a state survey showed that two-thirds of Iowans were unaware they had signed up or authorized any charges by Vertrue, Inc. The Iowa Supreme Court ruled that Vertrue's financial, privacy and health programs also violated the buying club law and added $10 million to the previous judgment for restitution, fines, and legal fees handed down by District Judge Robert Hutchison in 2010. An additional penalty of $180,000 was included after it was determined that Vertrue\u2019s fraud targeted the elderly citizens of Iowa. Assistant Attorney General Steven St. Clair states that the ruling against Vertrue, Inc. should allow some customers to receive refunds while also deterring future fraudulent companies from operating in Iowa. The Assistant Attorney General also stated that Vertrue is still collecting monthly fees from those who haven\u2019t cancelled their memberships.\u000aSome of Vertrue, Inc\u2019s tactics include :\u000aAn offer of a $25 gift card and a "30-day risk-free trial membership" to customers who had purchased unrelated items over the phone. The script was deceptive because it falsely implied the gift card was a reward for the earlier purchase and didn't inform consumers they were purchasing a membership. An Internet solicitation promising customers access to credit reports and scores if they signed up for a "FREE 7-day trial." The fine print noted that it actually cost $29.95 monthly. Two separate phone calls were required to cancel. \u000aOn March 13, 2014 an Atlanta law firm, Webb, Klase & lemond, LLC filed a class action lawsuit against Vertrue, Inc, Adaptive Marketing, LLC, Velo Holdings, MasterCard International, Inc., MyLife.com, Inc., and Oak Investment Partners. The suit states that Vertrue partners with MyLife.com and other deceptive online businesses to trick consumers into unknowingly joining Vertrue\u2019s \u201cconsumer savings clubs.\u201d MasterCard is included in the lawsuit because it continues to process charges for Vertrue, Inc. while knowing of the fraudulent basis by which they are made which violates MasterCard agreements.\u000aThis new Lawsuit lists the companies that administer these \u201csavings clubs\u201d they include Adaptive Marketing, LLC, include At Home Rewards, At Home Rewards+, BusinessMax, Cross Country Savings, DealMax, Home Savings Mall, Food and Flix, Getaway and Save, Leisure Exclusives, My Great Deals, Passport to Fun, Passport to Fun+, SavingsAce, SavingSmart, Shopping Essentials, Shopping Essentials+, Simply You, Today\u2019s Escapes, Today\u2019s Escapes+, ValueMax, and Your Savings Club.\u000aThe tactics remain the same as consumers are tricked into joining membership into a savings club. The suit asserts that the other Defendants are vital to the improper billing scheme. First, Vertrue transmits a consumer\u2019s credit card data to the related credit card network, which the complaint alleges was MasterCard. MasterCard verifies the consumer\u2019s identity and, the lawsuit states, analyzes the transaction to determine whether it is fraudulent. MasterCard transmits the relevant data to the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank which, if it authorizes the charge, sends a verification message to MasterCard, which then informs the issuing bank that the charge has been authorized, according to the suit. The suit claims that the issuing bank then informs Vertrue of the authorization, at which point the purchase is completed and the issuing bank and MasterCard subsequently \u201cclear\u201d and \u201csettle\u201d all of Vertrue\u2019s charges for that day, at which point the illicitly obtained funds are sent to Vertrue. The suit contends that all the Defendants are well aware of the illegal scheme, but they nonetheless participate in order to obtain substantial transaction fees. \u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aVertrue website\u000aVertrue Announces Completion of Merger\u000aStocklemon.com report on Vertrue\u000aVertrue Buys Neverblue Media\u000aVerture:Connecticut Company Liable For 20 Years Of Consumer Fraud In Iowa\u000aIowa Court ruling (62 Pages)\u000aMSN Video describing how system works, includes Vertrue's response

aVEncore un soir (meaning One More Night) is a French-language studio album by Canadian singer Celine Dion, released by Sony Music Entertainment on 26 August 2016. It is her first French studio album since 2012's Sans attendre. Encore un soir features songs produced mainly by Humberto Gatica, Scott Price, Silvio Lisbonne, Zaho and Jacques Veneruso. The first single from the album, also titled "Encore un soir" was released on 24 May 2016 and topped the charts in Francophone countries. Encore un soir is Dion's first French album since 2005's On ne change pas released in the United States.\u000aThe album garnered positive reviews from music critics and became a commercial success. Encore un soir topped the charts in France, Canada, Belgium and Switzerland, and was certified Diamond in France, 2× Platinum in Canada and Platinum in Belgium and Switzerland. It became the best-selling album of 2016 in Belgium, the second best-selling album of 2016 in France (best-selling album by a female artist), the seventh best-selling album of 2016 in Switzerland and the eighth best-selling album in Canada (the only Francophone album on the list). Encore un soir also became Dion's first French-language album to appear on the US Billboard charts. It has sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Background ==\u000aIn August 2015, Dion's manager, Aldo Giampaolo, announced that the singer will be releasing French and English language albums in 2016 and 2017, respectively. This French album will feature mainly new material, but will also contain a cover of Robert Charlebois', "Ordinaire", and a remastered version of "Trois heures vingt" which was originally released on the singer's 1984 studio album, Mélanie. On 19 May 2016, celinedion.com began revealing excerpts of the lyrics of the lead single, "Encore un soir", written by Jean-Jacques Goldman. The lead single was released on 24 May 2016. The cover art for the single was revealed on 17 May 2016, and is identical to the cover art for the album.\u000aDuring a series of interviews with various news outlets that took place on 12 May 2016 at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Dion announced that the upcoming French album would be released in August 2016. On 1 July 2016, the track list for the album was released on various news websites, citing a standard edition with twelve tracks, and a deluxe version with fifteen. On 9 November 2015, celinedion.com began a contest which allowed for fans to submit a track to be selected for Dion to record for this album. On 2 December 2015, after more than 1000 votes, Dion's website announced that the winner of the contest was Daniel Picard, and his track titled, "À la plus haute branche" will be included on the album.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Content ==\u000aEncore un soir was recorded between June 2015 and June 2016. In the middle of recording it, in January 2016, Dion's husband and manager, René Angélil died. The album was released over seven months later, in August 2016. Dion and Angélil's vision of a new collaboration with legendary French artist Jean-Jacques Goldman came to fruition with "Encore un soir", marking a long-awaited reunion, after over twelve years. Released as the lead single, the title track became a commercial and critical success. For the first time, the French artists Francis Cabrel and Serge Lama co-wrote a song for Dion ("Plus qu'ailleurs"). Jacques Veneruso, one of her most trusted collaborators in recent years, has written and composed a new song as well ("Si c'était à refaire"). Grand Corps Malade has once again, after Sans attendre, offered his poetry to this new album on "L'étoile" and "Les yeux au ciel". Dion also worked with new writers and producers. One of them was Zaho and LNT Musik (Ludovic Carquet and Therry Marie-Louise) who wrote and produced "Ma faille", "Tu sauras" and "À vous" (on the Deluxe edition). Other new partners include Florent Mothe and Mutine (Manon Romiti and Silvio Lisbonne) who wrote "L'étoile", "Les yeux au ciel" and "Le bonheur en face".\u000aDion wanted to pay tribute to Quebec rich musical repertoire by reinterpreting the classic Robert Charlebois song "Ordinaire". Marc Dupré also collaborated with Dion on this album on "Je nous veux" and "Toutes ces choses". Daniel Picard saw his song "À la plus haute branche" chosen from over 4,000 submissions following a contest launched on Dion's website. All these "Quebec" songs were produced by Humberto Gatica and Scott Price. Aside from "À vous", the Deluxe edition also includes "Ma force" written by Vianney and a remastered version of "Trois heures vingt", Dion's 1984 song. "Trois heures vingt" was recorded for the Mélanie album. It was featured on Encore un soir because Angélil was particularly fond of this song, which was played during his funeral service at exactly 3:20 pm, marking the commencement of the ceremony. It was also the song which opened Dion's Summer Tour 2016. Other songs from the album performed on this tour included "Encore un soir", "Ordinaire" and "À la plus haute branche" (in Canada).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Singles ==\u000a"Encore un soir" was released as a lead single from the album on 24 May 2016. It garnered positive reviews from music critics and topped the charts in France, Quebec and the French-speaking part of Switzerland. It also reached top ten in Luxembourg and Belgium. On 12 August 2016, the audio of "Trois heures vingt" was uploaded on YouTube/Vevo. Next week, the song entered the chart in France at number 73. On 19 August 2016, the lyric video of this song was also released. On 11 October 2016, "L'étoile" was announced as the second single in Canada. In 2017, "L'étoile" was released as the third single in France and Belgium. On 14 October 2016, "Si c'était à refaire" was sent to radio stations in France and Belgium as the second single there. On 13 February 2017, "Je nous veux" was announced as the third single in Canada. "Les yeux au ciel" was released as the fourth single in France on 14 April 2017 and Canada in June 2017.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Promotion ==\u000a\u000aIn November 2015, Dion's official website announced first shows of her upcoming Summer Tour 2016. Dion toured Belgium, France and Canada between 20 June 2016 and 31 August 2016, and performed a total of twenty-eight shows. The sold-out tour garnered positive reviews, with Dion performing several songs never performed live before, mainly from the 1 fille & 4 types album. The setlist featured only few songs from the upcoming Encore un soir album: "Trois heures vingt", "Encore un soir", "Ordinaire" and "À la plus haute branche" (added in Canada). On 7 September 2016, Dion performed "Encore un soir" and "Les yeux au ciel" for the very first time on television on M6's Music Show \u2013 100% tubes 2016 in France. On 1 October 2016, she also performed "Encore un soir" and "Les yeux au ciel" on Le Grand Show on France 2. Both shows were recorded in June 2016, while Dion was touring France. In the summer of 2017, Dion toured Europe with her Celine Dion Live 2017 concert tour.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Critical reception ==\u000aEncore un soir received positive reviews from music critics. Nicolas Houle from La Presse wrote that "Encore un soir", written by Jean-Jacques Goldman, comes with remarkable restraint and subtlety and is probably the strongest track on the album. He also praised "Ordinaire", originally sung by Robert Charlebois, and also two songs written by Grand Corps Malade ("L'étoile" and "Les yeux au ciel") and "À la plus haute branche" by Daniel Picard. Alain de Repentigny, from La Presse+ wrote that the album is orchestrated and praised "Plus qu'ailleurs" (written by Francis Cabrel and Serge Lama), "L'étoile" (an uptempo track with music by Florent Mothe and Mutine), "Encore un soir", "Je nous veux" and "Toutes ces choses" (both written by Marc Dupré), "Si c'était à refaire" (by Jacques Veneruso), "Tu sauras" (by Zaho) and "À la plus haute branche". Benjamin Locoge from Paris Match also wrote a positive review. He praised "Plus qu'ailleurs", "À la plus haute branche" and the feminine adaptation of "Ordinaire".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Accolades ==\u000a\u000aOn 26 September 2016, Dion was nominated for the NRJ Music Award in category Francophone Female Artist of the Year.

aVWo Weihan (Chinese: \u6c83\u7ef4\u6c49; pinyin: Wò Wéihàn; 1949 \u2013 November 28, 2008), a native of Qiqihar, Heilongjiang, was a Chinese scientist and entrepreneur of Daur nationality. He was executed at the age of 58-59 on November 28, 2008, by firing squad, along with missile expert Guo Wanjun, 66, for passing sensitive information to a Taiwanese NGO. Weihan was interrogated for ten months in 2005 and allowed access to a lawyer in 2006. His trial was held in secrecy in 2007. \u000a\u000a\u000a== Charges ==\u000aThe case against Wo related to alleged passing of sensitive national security information, which China argued justified special handling of the case.\u000aIt was claimed that Wo became a spy for Taiwan intelligence agency with the codename "YANG DONG". He got to know Mr Guo during a wedding ceremony in early 1990s. The Taiwan intelligence agency also invested (USD) $300,000 to help Wo's first wife, to set up a restaurant in Austria.\u000aMainland Chinese media and portals, including Global Times and Sina, released details of Wo and Guo's spying activities after the execution. In the early nineties, Wo Weihan bought critical information and documents on DF-31, from Guo Wanjun, a missile expert who had participated in the design of DF-31. Mr. Wo and Guo's activities resulted in the leakage of the top secret information of the DF-31, including internal design and structure of the missile, causing significant impact on Chinese national security. They both were accused of spying for Taiwan and US intelligence agencies by selling sensitive information on intercontinental ballistic missiles. Neither Taiwan nor US have made an official statement in this regard.\u000aAccording to the verdict released by the High Court of Beijing after the sentencing in March 2008, the charges Wo Weihan was convicted of included: "...discussing the health of senior Chinese leaders." In PRC, the health status of senior leaders is declared top secret. Also included in the verdict were convictions of the smuggling of secret information of PLA's night time equipment. Wo was also accused of copying military photos from a magazine, which was public at the time but later declared classified.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Disputes ==\u000aThe execution took place on the final day of the China-EU Human Rights Dialog in Beijing. The US, for whom Wo spied, and the EU strongly condemned the execution.\u000a\u201cWe are deeply disturbed and dismayed by reports that the Chinese government has carried out the death penalty against Wo Weihan,\u201d Susan Stevenson, a spokeswoman at the US embassy in Beijing said. She said that Wo\u2019s arrest and trial had fallen short of international standards for due process. \u201cReportedly Mr Wo did not have access to legal counsel until after the prosecuting officials completed their investigation. His confession was coerced and the charges against him were questionable.\u201d\u000aTheir executions came at a time when China had been presenting itself as a reformed and more humane state, particularly on the eve of China's Olympic debut. The EU and US response to the executions indicate that the executions severely challenged the credibility of the SPC death penalty review reform, which aimed to reduce the number of executions in China (estimated at 7000 per year). The reason that Wo's execution caused dispute between China and EU is because Wo's 2 daughters, who are now Austrian citizens, resorted to Austria and EU to first request a fair and transparent trial for their father, and later pleaded for amnesty as the deficiencies in the prosecution of the case became clear. Diplomatic efforts made behind the curtains had no result for three years. Media coverage and an expanded advocacy campaign which included pleas by Condoleezza Rice, President Heinz Fischer of Austria and the EU Troika were also in vain.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Families of the alleged spies ==\u000aWo Weihan's wife and junior daughter saw Wo Weihan on the morning of November 27. Neither he nor they were given official confirmation that the sentence had been approved and that an execution was pending. The elder daughter of Wo expected to be able to see her father that week after the Chinese Ministry Foreign Affairs promised to the Austrian Embassy in Beijing that a second visit would be allowed for the elder daughter. However, Wo was executed on the morning of November 28, to the surprise of the family and the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This broken promise led to very strained relations between the Austrian and Chinese Ministries of Foreign Affairs. Austria viewed it as an intentional affront.\u000aAccording to Qin Gang, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,".....Wo Weihan is a Chinese citizen.... He could not be treated in a different way only because he has some foreign relatives."\u000aGuo's family were not allowed to visit Guo during the years of imprisonment, and only five days after the execution, which they had found out about through Wo's family, did they receive a notice that they could pick up Guo's ashes.   \u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThis article lists characters of the television series Emergency!.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Los Angeles County Fire Squad 51 Firefighter/Paramedics ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Roy DeSoto ===\u000aRoy DeSoto is portrayed by actor Kevin Tighe. DeSoto worked with partner John Gage as a firefighter/paramedic for the Los Angeles County Fire Department at Station 51. He first met Gage when he was recruiting personnel for the newly designated paramedic program, of which he was in the first group of six graduates. He assisted the physicians with instruction during Gage's class at Rampart General Hospital, where his mentors were Dr. Kelly Brackett, Nurse Dixie McCall, and Dr. Joe Early. He was married, and had a son (Chris) and a daughter who was never canonically named, though only his wife, Joanne, appeared in the pilot of the series. His family also has a dog. In the episode "The Exam," we find out he was born on 7 November.\u000aWhile his single partner was often portrayed as intense and impulsive, DeSoto was more quiet and often served to keep Gage under control. As with his partner, very little is discussed about DeSoto's life prior to the fire service, other than mentioned during a training class in the pilot episode that he served in the military as a medic in Vietnam(Tighe himself was in the United States Army) stationed at Fort Knox, Kentucky during the mid 1960s.) In the first-season episode "Dealer's Wild", we learn that he has had 20 hours of flying time.\u000aDuring the third season, DeSoto is offered a promotion to engineer, which he eventually turns down in order to remain a paramedic. However, in the last episode ("Greatest Rescues of Emergency!"), he and Gage are promoted to captain, and they are each assigned to new stations.\u000aNot much is known about what Roy does on his days off, except when he, Chet, and Johnny take long trips together, either fishing, or camping trips (mostly in Johnny's beat-up white Land Rover). DeSoto has a taste for classic cars, and owns a beige early to mid-60's Porsche along with a Chevrolet pickup.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== John Gage ===\u000aJohn Roderick "Johnny" Gage is portrayed by actor Randolph Mantooth. Gage worked with Roy DeSoto as a firefighter/paramedic for the Los Angeles County Fire Department and usually rode "shotgun" in Squad 51. Prior to working as a paramedic, he worked for the rescue squad at Station 10. Initially against the suggestion to qualify as a paramedic, he decided to pursue it after a couple of incidents when he realized he could have done more with the specialized medical training. He met DeSoto when applying for the new program (see "The Wedsworth-Townsend Act") and after graduation decided to partner with him at the newly built Station 51. He and DeSoto would remain partners until the last episode ("Greatest Rescues of Emergency!"), when both would be promoted to captain. Gage, like DeSoto, then had to give up the Paramedics and was assigned his own station.\u000aFor some reason, Gage often prefixed his communications with Rampart with "Ummm" or "Uhhh".\u000aLittle is mentioned in the series about Gage's life prior to the fire department. In the episode "Peace Pipe" it was brought up that Gage was Native American and grew up on an Indian reservation, though no particular tribe is mentioned. (Mantooth is half-Seminole.) He also states in another episode ("Saddled"), that he was raised on a ranch; again, no location is given. In the episode "The Exam", we hear that he was born 28 August.\u000aGage was single throughout the series and often dated (or pursued) the E/R nurses at Rampart General Hospital, except, of course, for head nurse Dixie McCall, who was his mentor. Intense and professional on the job, Gage's good looks and his impulsive charm away from the job made him a perfect dramatic foil to his more low-key partner. He was also the butt of many of fellow firefighter Chet Kelly's jokes, and often attempted, with varying degrees of success, to get even. (One time Gage bought a box of chocolates and injected them with pure garlic extract, and, at the end of the episode, wound up sampling his own chocolates, to his shock and embarrassment, and twice, on different occasions, he was able to get even with Chet by placing a CPR dummy into the trunk of his car.)\u000aGage was somewhat accident-prone, and on a few occasions each season, he wound up a patient at Rampart General Hospital. One of these occasions ensued from a hit-and-run collision (a car hit him in the street and then sped away), and Johnny, spending the rest of the episode in the fracture ward at Rampart General, is treated to emotional abuse by the nurse in the ward (Carole Cook). In the episode "Virus," he contracted a potentially fatal strain of Asian flu, which killed another firefighter. In another instance he is bitten by a rattlesnake on his right leg while on a rescue mission and, after treating himself, is rushed to the hospital by his station mates, where he survives by being given the antivenom in time.\u000aFor most of the show, Gage turned down promotions until the final episode, (Greatest Rescues of Emergency!), where he and his partner, Roy DeSoto, both accepted, and were promoted to, the rank of captain. They were given new station assignments, separate from each other, effectively ending the series.\u000aGage has a taste for sturdy off-road vehicles, and owns a white early model Land Rover, which he later trades in for a Jeep Honcho. He also has a very powerful tool \u2014 his sense of humor.\u000a\u000a\u000a== LA County Fire Engine 51 Firefighters ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Hank Stanley ===\u000aHenry "Hank" Stanley, captain of Los Angeles County Fire Station 51, is portrayed by actor / screenwriter Michael Norell. Stanley replaced Captain Dick Hammer in the beginning of the second season and remained 51's commanding officer throughout the remainder of the series.\u000aLittle is discussed in the series about Stanley outside the fire department, though one episode mentions he is married, has children, and that his wife drives an Edsel. Often addressed as "Cap" by the other firefighters on the A-shift, he is very competent and relatively easy-going, and has a good sense of humor. In the Season 6 episode Onward And Upward Stanley begins studying to become a chief, but when he finds out his old station captain, now Battalion Chief McConnike, is on the review board, Stanley becomes paranoid. He convinces himself that McConnike still holds a grudge for an incident in which Stanley deliberately set McConnike's dress uniform hat on fire.\u000aIn the sixth-season episode Fair Fight, a basset hound suddenly appears in the station when the crew returns from a call. The crew decides to keep him as the station's new mascot and John Gage names him "Henry". The captain initially rejects the name but finally allows it as long as "no one ever calls him 'Hank'".\u000aDuring the show, Stanley is seen as a competent leader, and he can also be forceful if he needs to be, though he rarely is, he is also quick witted, intelligent, and very observant. He is also known to come off with some snappy comebacks when needed.\u000aNot as prone to injury as Gage or Kelly can be, Stanley still has his famous faux pas. One of these is during the episode "The Great Crash Diet," when his bare hands come into contact with a car that is touching a live power line. This, of course, results in him getting a severe electrical shock, and having involuntary muscle contractions, until he reaches the hospital. This results in Stoker taking command of the scene.\u000aCaptain Stanley usually gives Johnny and Roy a hand in the field, be it with getting vitals on a victim, manning the biophone, or general help when needed.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Mike Stoker ===\u000aMike Stoker, portrayed by Mike Stoker, who used his real name for the series, is a firefighter specialist (engineer), and also drives Engine 51. Both the character and the actor operated the pump unit at his real station, LACoFD Fire Station 69 in Topanga Canyon.\u000aStoker is the quiet one on the show, generally spouting two or three lines throughout an episode, or often remaining silent the entire episode. He is shown to be very easygoing and even-tempered, rarely becoming irritated with his crew mates, and on occasion, has been shown acting as a peacemaker (or trying to). He is essentially the exact opposite of the impulsive, talkative Chet Kelly.\u000aAs the engineer, Stoker is second-in-command to the captain. However, he is rarely seen pulling rank, an exception being in "The Great Crash Diet," when Captain Stanley is injured during a rescue and Stoker briefly takes over command.\u000aIn the show's first season, Stoker hardly ever talked, generally only speaking when he had to, and often remaining in the background. As the show progressed, he began to talk and interact with his crewmates a little more, often participating in their schemes and jokes. He apparently shows little loyalty when it comes to prank playing, as shown in "Messin' Around," when he is seen acting as Kelly's lookout while Kelly sets a water bomb, then realizes at the end of the episode that Kelly is about to walk into his own trap, but makes no move to stop him. It is established among the fans that Stoker never said more than three sentences at a time. Although meant as a joke, this is, in fact, consistent with most of the show. This pattern was known to have been broken only once, in "The Great Crash Diet". It has also been noted that he tends to talk a little bit more when he is excited or worried, such as when he showed excitement about the station getting a new fire engine, or when he displayed concern for Conway, an injured fireman from another station, who was apparently one of his friends. He also was the pitcher on the station's softball team; apparently, he wasn't very good, as Gage tried to recruit Kelly to pitch in a game at the Fireman's Picnic in order to settle a bet with another station.\u000aStoker is shown to be intelligent and observant, and it is also apparent that he enjoys reading quite a bit, as he is often seen reading at the station. Little is known about what he does in his downtime, since he says little about it, as compared to the others, namely Gage and Kelly, who tend to go on and on about what they did on their days off. Stoker does mention in one episode that he has a dune buggy, so it is likely that he goes to the beach a lot.\u000aStoker displays a variety of talents throughout the series, including cooking (he makes great spaghetti and fried chicken), singing (he mentions in "Firehouse Four" that he sang in a glee club once), and a quick wit; this is shown at various times when he occasionally spouts a one-liner, sometimes no more than two words.\u000aIt is not known for sure if Stoker is married or not. Conway, the injured fireman from "Brushfire," says, "He's a great guy. I don't care what his wife says," after Stoker helps get a tree off him, but this could be meant as a joke. He was also asked on his advice on mothers-in-law, but this could also have been meant to poke fun at him. But Gage appeared serious when he asked the question. Also, when a young attractive woman comes to the firehouse to thank DeSoto for looking after her plants while she was a patient in the hospital, Stoker offers his services along with Gage, Kelly, and Lopez, which would indicate he is single.\u000aStoker has helped Gage and DeSoto out in the field, usually handling the oxygen, attempting to calm a victim, or helping to get vitals on more than one victim.\u000aOccasionally, Stoker has come off as a middle of the road kind of person, but when help is needed, or a friend is hurt, he is right there; for instance, when Gage was struck by a hit-and-run driver, Stoker, DeSoto, and Kelly were the first three to arrive and administer aid.\u000aIn the end, Stoker was promoted to Captain before he retired in 1992.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Chester B. Kelly ===\u000aChester B. "Chet" Kelly serves as a firefighter assigned to Engine 51 with the Los Angeles County Fire Department. He was portrayed by actor Tim Donnelly, who acted in other series produced by Webb, such as the 1967\u20131970 incarnation of Dragnet, in which he played such varying roles as, in one installment, a young marijuana addict whose infant child accidentally drowns in a bathtub, and in another episode, a troubled 23-year-old who steals superhero movie posters.\u000aKelly's full name in Emergency! was Chester B. Kelly, which was revealed during the third-season episode "The Promotion," where he took the test to become an engineer and placed only 74th on the list. He once mentioned that his grandfather had been a New York City Subway motorman.\u000aKelly was often portrayed as a sometimes arrogant and wisecracking clown with a penchant for tomfoolery; he often made paramedic John Gage the butt of his practical jokes, such as a series of showering water bombs (an example highly prevalent in the 1974 episode "Messin' Around"), and tricking Gage into thinking that his current girlfriend was telling him secrets about their dates. The practical joker\u2014Kelly's alter ego\u2014is known as "The Phantom" around the station. On lesser occasions the tables were turned; a case in point was when Gage planted a CPR dummy in the trunk of Kelly's car and waited for him to scream loudly when he found it. There have also been moments when his own pranks have backfired on him; a case in point is "Messin' Around," in which Kelly gets showered with his own water bomb. To this, Gage states, "Well, it do look like The Phantom got caught."\u000aThere are times when Kelly tends to talk too much, and this sometimes got him in more trouble than he would have been in if he had simply remained quiet. One time was when he ended up sharing a room with DeSoto after dislocating his shoulder on a call (in the season two episode "Syndrome"). (DeSoto had been admitted to Rampart to have his tonsils\u2014which had regenerated\u2014removed, and he had ended up sharing a room with the ever-talkative Kelly. Gage had showed up with ice cream for DeSoto, but it was evident that DeSoto had wanted to leave the room through his facial expressions.) Another example of Kelly talking too much was when Captain Stanley went on vacation, and the crew drew an old-fashioned Captain who was also a hero within the department. Kelly's constant talking did not endear him to the older Captain.\u000aBut Kelly's competence as a firefighter was unquestioned when the alarm rang; his compassion also showed through at times as well. This was prevalent in "Messin' Around": Gage and DeSoto had just returned to the station from taking a poisoned child to the Rampart ER; the boy later died. At the station, Gage was unknowingly about to open a rigged cabinet door with a water bomb inside, but Kelly stopped him, saying, "The Phantom doesn't like to strike at times like this; he knows how much you two tried to do for that kid." Gage gratefully got the message.\u000aPrior to becoming a firefighter, Kelly, who was in the Army, also worked as a heavy equipment operator, and even during his time as a firefighter, he operated heavy equipment that was handy. He even once operated a train engine to move a burning boxcar away from a tanker loaded with ammonium nitrate.\u000aAlthough Kelly tends to make Gage the target for his practical jokes, there is a kind of brotherly bond between them. Several examples include when Gage was bitten by a rattlesnake, and Kelly helped treat Gage on the way to the hospital; another was when Gage was struck by a hit and run driver, he waited at the hospital for any news; and another when Kelly was trapped in an old and unstable hospital building, and had dislocated his shoulder, Gage was the one who got him out and treated him.\u000aWhen Gage and DeSoto need an extra hand, Kelly is one out of three that usually help out, the other two being Captain Stanley and Lopez; usually, Kelly mans the biophone when Gage and DeSoto are too busy to do so. He has also, on several occasions, along with Lopez, driven the Squad to the hospital.\u000aKelly appears clean shaven in the first season. In Season Two, he begins wearing a mustache which remains for the remainder of the series.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Marco Lopez ===\u000aMarco Lopez, portrayed by Marco Lopez who, like Stoker, used his real name for the series. Lopez, of Mexican-American ancestry, spoke with a slight Spanish accent; the actor, then sometimes billed as Marco Antonio, did likewise in episodes of Dragnet, and Adam-12. He sometimes lapses into Spanish (including in one episode in which the firemen found a huge pile of money and Lopez counted it in Spanish). His Spanish was very good.\u000aAs with Stoker, we do not know much of what Lopez does on his time off, as he rarely discusses it. We do know that he is a member of a semi-pro soccer team and likes to ski. He's proud of his Mexican heritage, enjoys refried beans, and has a grandfather who is 82. He also expresses an interest in animals, and mentions having two cats (episode Alley cat).\u000aMarco is very cool and calm in even the tensest of situations, and rarely loses his patience with anyone, except maybe with Johnny on occasion. Once, he chased after Johnny with a hangman's noose in hand, when Johnny had been talking about gaining extra money by competing in the local rodeo circuit, and he, along with Roy and Johnny, threatened to ram a steak down Chet's mouth when the latter made a sauce out of health food ingredients.\u000aLopez is often seen cooking throughout the series. In one episode, Battalion Chief McConnike visits the station and is impressed with Lopez's Irish stew. He has also made chili on more than on occasion. In real life, Lopez cooked for the actors and crew on the set, and has published a cookbook.\u000aOn more than one occasion, Marco has helped Johnny and Roy, usually by being an extra hand in the field, or by driving the squad to the hospital when Johnny and Roy are unable to.\u000aLopez appears clean shaven during the first 3 seasons and begins wearing a mustache in Season Four through the remainder of the series.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Rampart General Hospital Staff ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Kelly Brackett ===\u000aKelly "Kel" Brackett, M.D./F.A.C.S./A.C.E.P., is portrayed by Robert Fuller, better known prior to this role as an actor in Westerns. Dr. Brackett, one of the two principal characters of the series, was a dedicated and fairly no-nonsense senior ER physician at Rampart General Hospital. Brackett and ER head nurse Dixie McCall were romantically involved with each other in the early days of the series, but were only close friends during the series run. In the pilot episode, The Wedsworth-Townsend Act, it was revealed that Brackett went to Johns Hopkins and took residency at the Mayo Clinic.\u000aBrackett, along with neurologist/colleague, Dr. Joe Early and Nurse McCall, trained the first two classes of paramedics for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Initially Brackett was opposed to the newly designated program, but would eventually change his opinion after an accident involving ER nurse Ms. McCall and her subsequent emergency medical treatment initiated by firefighter/paramedics John Gage and Roy DeSoto. In a surprise trip to Sacramento he put his support behind the passage of a state bill that would fully authorize the paramedic program ("The Wedsworth-Townsend Act"), by stating that he was not a big fan of the bill, but that he would back it until something better came along. As the series progressed he would become very supportive of the paramedics themselves, and even defended them when Paramedic DeSoto was severely criticized for his actions in the field by another Rampart physician (who suddenly ducked away when Brackett approached and demanded an explanation).\u000aIn the pilot episode, Brackett was firmly cautious in his work, fully aware that emergency medicine was by no means an exact science. His personality bordered on hard-nosed, and he rebuked those around him when they overstepped the boundary of their own capabilities (or authority). But when Emergency! became a series, Brackett began to show a penchant for flying by the seat of his pants, at times going with gut instinct on limited information. For example, in Season 1, when a patient began to suffer respiratory paralysis and double vision, Brackett speculated the condition might be botulism (thorough investigation later proved his theory right).\u000aOn more than one occasion, Brackett traveled into the field to assist the paramedics with difficult emergencies. In Season 3, he and Morton performed field surgery on a man who had a live grenade lodged in his abdomen. In Season 5, he rode along with the crew of an LACoFD helicopter and responded to a vehicle accident. In another episode of the same season, he and McCall responded to an incident where a patient's arm became entangled in a piece of machinery. In the interest of the patient's life, they prepared to amputate. Luckily, that was not necessary as both Johnny and Roy extricated the patient.\u000aBrackett became a patient himself less often than McCall, Gage and DeSoto. In Season 2, he and Gage were both struck by a highly contagious virus. In Season 5, after an aquarium was delivered to his office, he suffered from a toxic reaction to a catfish bite. Finally in Season 6, when he was involved in a traffic crash; his car was broadsided by a reckless drunk driver who was killed at the accident scene; the drunk's daughter, a backseat passenger, survived with only a broken foot. However, Brackett felt guilty for what happened, as even though he was trained to save lives, he was part of an accident that took one. McCall helped him overcome his guilt.\u000aIn the sixth season, his on-screen appearances have been reduced, because of the direction Emergency! was going, right at the same time, Fuller was looking to do more Westerns.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Dixie McCall ===\u000aDixie "Dix" McCall, R.N., is portrayed by Julie London, better known prior to this role as a singer in popular music, a frequent panelist in game shows, and as an actress in B-movies and Westerns. Ms. McCall, another principal character of the series, who is one of the four stars to appear in every episode of the series. McCall served as an army nurse during the Korean War; she was also the head nurse of the emergency room of Rampart General Hospital and was involved in the very beginning of the paramedic program. She argued the skills and qualifications of paramedics to the dismissive, Dr. Kelly Brackett, crediting the medics with whom she served in Korea for saving countless lives that would have otherwise been lost. In the early part of the series, she and Brackett were romantically linked with each other, but became best friends throughout the series run. Also, she frequently helped another one of her best buddies, Dr. Joe Early, in the emergency room, for all ages, along with young intern, Dr. Mike Morton. In addition, she assisted in training and running calls with the newly, young designated paramedic squads, John Gage and Roy DeSoto of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, until the passing of a state bill authorizing paramedics to work on their own in the field.\u000aIn the pilot episode, she was knocked unconscious at an accident scene while running a call with Squad 51 paramedics, Gage and DeSoto, in ("The Wedsworth-Townsend Act"). Gage and DeSoto went beyond their authorizations to help her. This incident led Brackett to change his opinion and fully support the program. But when Emergency! became a series, McCall stayed at Rampart, assisting Brackett and/or Early to work on each of the patient's cases, the ones Gage and DeSoto brought each one in the hospital, all the while, she became a teacher, mentor, friend and a mother figure to Gage and DeSoto.\u000aLittle is mentioned in the series about McCall's life prior to the hospital. In the episode "The Firehouse Four," Randolph Mantooth's character Gage asked McCall if she knew anything about singing (London herself was a singer), when Station 51 is entering the firefighter's barbershop quartet contest, not Roy and McCall replied, "A little."\u000aKnown for her calm, exceptional beauty, McCall was also tough and efficient. In addition to paramedics, McCall was also partnered with other nurses, somewhat doctors and medical staff. In Season 1, she even helped a klutzy nurse (played by Jack Webb stock actress Patricia Mickey) learn how to overcome her awkwardness "by explaining Brackett to her". Right away, the young nurse, no longer fumbling, also assumes McCall's mannerisms when she gives Brackett one of Ms. McCall's familiar enigmatic smiles. In Season 2, when she insisted that an estranged female doctor (played by Alicia Bond) talk to Brackett, based on her experience, he refused to talk about it. In another episode of the same season, she was introduced to Gage's and DeSoto's trainee (played by Kip Niven) whose self-confidence lacks in tight situations. In Season 3, she encouraged the assistant nurse to take on the case with Early, on a patient suffering from heart disease, from Squad 45. In Season 4, she worked with a nurse, whom Squad 51, especially Gage were all competing with, for a date. In another episode of the same season, she also escorted Gage to work with his high school classmate (played by Universal contract player Colby Chester), as his and DeSoto's new trainee for Squad 51. In Season 5, a retired nurse and McCall's predecessor (played by Anne Seymour) tried to commit suicide, who was brought to Rampart, where she befriended a little girl with paraplegia, who drowned in a swimming pool. After her recovery, the former nurse talked Dixie along with Brackett and Early, into working with them. In another episode of the same season, prior to Gage's recovery from his hit-and-run accident, McCall hired a physical therapist (played by Universal contract player Gretchen Corbett), when Gage actually had a nurse (played by veteran actress Carole Cook), who was "out to get him". Finally in Season 6, when Gage asked her for supplies, McCall turned those supplies over to another one of her nurses (played by Laurie Kennedy). Fortunately for Gage and DeSoto, they no longer have to tolerate the supply nurse, due to the shortage of supplies that nurse had for them.\u000aOn more than one occasion, she even confronted her nursing staff and/or other medical professions on their inappropriate behavior, either inside or outside the hospital. In addition with Dr. Morton, who possessed a cocky personality, she encouraged the young intern not to talk in front of families like that. In Season 2, after Gage's and DeSoto's paramedic trainee, and former medic from the Vietnam war, (played by Mantooth's lifelong friend Robert Pratt) failed to follow the instructions of a doctor, McCall, before Gage and DeSoto, gave him specific reasons why competing with doctors had led him into a lot of trouble. In Season 3, after Early had difficulty dealing with a defiant nurse (played by Judi Meredith), McCall observed a complaint for her unprofessional and unruly behavior. Finally in Season 4, when a young, experienced nurse (played by Catherine Burns) spread a rumour about Morton's financial problems, McCall specifically told her not to be mouthing off about one of the doctor's private lives.\u000aNearly in the same situation as Gage and DeSoto, McCall was also occasionally known to be accident-prone at times. In addition to being knocked unconscious, in one episode of Season 2, McCall injured her toe, after being run over by a portable x-Ray guided by a klutzy orderly. In one episode of Season 3, her hand got caught in the vending machine in the lounge and Squad 51 was called to extricate her. In one episode of Season 4, as the entire Rampart staff threw Nurse McCall's birthday, she broke her ankle, before Gage broke his foot. Finally, in one episode of Season 6, she burned herself from a gas explosion in the basement laboratories of Rampart, alerting Gage and DeSoto above when the fire alarm was triggered.\u000aDuring the series, McCall turned down a "desk job" offer to become Rampart's nurse supervisor.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Joe Early ===\u000aJoe Early, M.D./F.A.C.S./A.C.E.P., is portrayed by actor Bobby Troup, better known prior to his role as a singer-songwriter, and in a small role in the 1970 Robert Altman film M*A*S*H as a jeep driver, who was also one of the four actors to appear in every episode of the series. Early worked at Rampart General Hospital as a neurosurgeon, but often assisted Dr. Kelly Brackett and nurse Dixie McCall in the emergency room, alongside firefighters/paramedics Johnny Gage and Roy DeSoto, who were actually his protégés.\u000aIn direct contrast to the more dynamic, quick-tempered Kelly Brackett, however, in direct identical to the lovely, calm Dixie McCall, Joe Early was also more low-key, avuncular, not fully in-charge, and certainly more tactful: when a hotheaded, powerful tycoon (played by Gene Raymond) threatened to take Brackett to court because of Brackett's treatment of the tycoon's son, Joe Early spoke to the father and successfully placated him. Early also apparently choked back tears and anger when talking to a man (played by Cliff Norton) whose wife was severely burned by a fire resulting from improperly stored gasoline (hoarded by the man in the midst of the 1970s "gas crisis"). And he gave a severe lecture to one man who had given another a \u201cprecordial thump in the rib cage"\u2014after \u201clearning\u201d CPR from watching television. Dr. Early snapped, \u201cI don't know whether your friend is having a heart attack or not, but your \u2018miracle cure' may have caved in his rib cage!\u201d\u000aEarly is shown to be gentle and knowledgeable when it comes to pediatric patients, and is often called upon by Brackett when injured children present themselves at Rampart.\u000aIn Season 3, Early undergoes heart surgery, much to the worry of all of the other characters. It is in this same episode that he takes a liking to Captain Stanley's clam chowder. This prompts the crew of Station 51 to present him with a thermos containing clam chowder during his recovery.\u000aHe filled in for Brackett frequently, on which his best friend wasn't available, though primarily, he worked with McCall. Beginning in Season 2, along with McCall, Gage and DeSoto, he helped a little girl cure her arm, after the paramedics resuced her, in a swimming pool drain. In Season 3, he helped a man, who was in a coma, suffering from a mysterious ailment. In an episode of the same season, he and McCall both treated an abused boy, offered him protection. In Season 4, he along with McCall, Gage and DeSoto, worked separately on a man, who was involved in a motorcycle accident, who in turn had only moved his left thumb, while the son is in a diabetic coma. In an episode of the same season, while Early was dealing with a middle-aged overweight belly dancer that had doubts about her future, McCall caught her having a crush on Early, and offered a change in careers. In Season 5, he calls DeSoto via phone in Catalina Island at a Coast Guard helicopter, where the diver suffers a heart attack. In another episode of the same season, he, along with McCall and Morton worked on a boy suffering from smoke inhalation and burns. In another episode of the same season, he, along with McCall and Morton, had worked on a beautician who swallowed diet pills. In another episode of the same season, after a friend had performed a CPR by an elderly, Early (along with McCall) took care of him. In the last episode of the same season, one of Early's helpers, Gage, has helped a non-responsive lady, with DeSoto, at the barstool, but has done more harm than good, when Gage was in a hit-and-run accident, Early took care of Roy's partner, before telling Roy his partner was a good paramedic at Station 51, whose partner also needs to be a good patient at Rampart. In Season 6, he along with McCall and Morton took care of a man suffering from sudden abdominal pains, after proposing to his girlfriend. In another episode of the same season, he took care of a college janitor who suffered from stomach pains, after drinking an ancient wine. In another episode of the same season, he took care of an elderly man, suffering from stomach pains, after drinking 50% alcohol, couldn't get his pants back, until he did as to what Early said. Finally, on the last episode, he along with McCall took care of an elderly musician experiencing heart trouble, who later underwent successful surgery.\u000aIn real-life, Bobby Troup was married to Julie London, who was also the best friend of Jack Webb. Troup died early in 1999.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Mike Morton ===\u000aMike Morton, M.D., portrayed by Ron Pinkard is a bespectacled young intern of African ancestry who had served in the United States Navy, unlike Nurse Dixie McCall, who served in the United States Army. Unlike Drs. Brackett or Early, Morton usually wore an older-style physician's uniform tunic with a buttoned neck or the standard green surgical "scrubs". Dixie commented on the relationship between Morton and the paramedics "our high-ego intern gave our low-threshold paramedics a bad time"; indeed, early on Morton often flaunted his status over that of Johnny and Roy, and was initially portrayed as uptight and somewhat cynical. However, with mentoring from Brackett the character softened during the run of the series and he became more friendly with the paramedics, and was ultimately shown to be as caring and competent as Brackett and Early but sometimes a hard-nosed physician. Little is known about his past, although he hints in "Camera Bug" that he may have grown up in a ghetto.\u000aAlthough extremely cool under pressure Morton does, at times, in comparison to his other mentor, McCall, he inadvertently cause others to think, or overreact. In one episode, gossip circulates that Morton is in severe debt; it is later discovered that he wants to take out a loan, and most of the calls he receives are routed to the hospital, rather than his home. In another episode, he inadvertently sends Chet on a health food kick that extends to the station. Morton would later correct the problem by having a deep discussion with Chet. He shows responsibility when there is trouble at the hospital, like a fire or explosion, taking charge of the situation, sounding the alarm, and organizing the evacuation of the hospital, such as in Season 6. When McCall is wounded by an explosion and fire in the basement laboratories, alerting Gage and DeSoto upstairs when the fire alarm is triggered, while they notify their dispatcher to send backup to Rampart, Morton gives the code word to evacuate the hospital.\u000aIn the series pilot, he was identified as "Dr. Tom Gray".

aVThe Skin Game is a 1931 British feature film by Alfred Hitchcock, based on a play by John Galsworthy and produced by British International Pictures. The story revolves around two rival families, the Hillcrists and the Hornblowers, and the disastrous results of the feud between them.\u000aAfter being thought to be in the public domain for decades, the film's rights were obtained by French media company Canal+ in 2005. A restored and remastered print of the film was released on DVD by Lionsgate Home Entertainment in 2007.\u000aEdmund Gwenn and Helen Haye reprised their respective roles as Mr. Hornblower and Mrs. Hillcrist from the 1921 silent version.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000aThe plot concerns a feud between two affluent families, the long-established (upper class) Hillcrists, played by C.V. France, Helen Haye, and Jill Esmond, and the nouveau riche (formerly working class) Hornblowers, played by Edmund Gwenn, John Longden, and Frank Lawton. Two underlying themes in the story are class warfare and the urbanization of the countryside.\u000aThe Hillcrists are upset by the actions of Mr. Hornblower, whom they consider to be ostentatious and crass, in buying up land, evicting tenant farmers, and surrounding the area with factories. The Hillcrists make every effort they can to preserve the last large piece of open land that adjoins their beautiful rural estate.\u000aAfter being tricked out of the land in an auction, the Hillcrists learn a dark secret about Mr. Hornblower's beautiful daughter-in-law Chloe (played by Phyllis Konstam). It turns out that she had previously earned a living by playing the professional "other woman" in pre-arranged divorce cases.\u000aWhen Mr. Hornblower learns of this secret, and that the Hillcrists have discovered it and are prepared to use it against his family, Mr. Hornblower agrees to sell the rural land to the Hillcrists for less than half the auction price, on the condition that the family swears to keep the information secret. However, the news starts to leak out, precipitating a crisis in the family.\u000aChloe Hornblower goes to the Hillcrists, begging them to help keep the secret from her husband, who is aware that something is going on. She hides behind a curtain when her husband unexpectedly storms into the Hillcrist home, demanding to know the secret.\u000aKeeping his promise to Chloe, Mr. Hillcrist makes up a story, but the young Mr. Hornblower is not convinced, and declares that he intends to end his marriage, even though Chloe is pregnant with his child.\u000aUpon hearing this, Chloe runs to the lily pond outside the Hillcrist home and drowns herself. When her body is discovered, the elder Hornblower concedes that Hillcrist has destroyed him and his family completely; he says if he can, he will harm Hillcrist or one of Hillcrist's family. Hillcrist makes a sincere apology but Hornblower calls him a hypocrite.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cast (in credits order) ==\u000aC. V.

aVThe Eagle Manufacturing Company of Appleton, Wisconsin first entered the farm equipment market in 1906 with a 32 horsepower (24 kW) tractor. In 1899 the company was located at 671 Superior St in Appleton Wisconsin.  In 1904 it built a production facility designed by architect Wallace W. De Long. It returned to the marketplace several years later, in 1929 offering a 20-35 Model E. Based on a two-cylinder traction engine design, the engine measured 8.00x9.00 inches in bore and stroke. A truly massive affair, it was rated at 20 drawbar horsepower and 35 belt-pulley horsepower. Eagle also built its Model H alongside the Model E from 1926 to 1930. With an identical 8.00-inch (203 mm) bore to the Model E, but a 1.00-inch (25 mm) longer stroke at 10.00 inches, the Model H created a brawny 40 horsepower (30 kW) at the drawbar. Eagle was one of the first tractor manufacturers to use a 6-cylinder engine. It switched from 2 cylinders to 6 cylinders in 1930.\u000a\u000aEagle built tractors from 1906, but halted production during World War II never to start its assembly lines again.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe LK-60Ya class (Russian: \u041b\u041a-60\u042f) is a Russian class of three nuclear-powered icebreakers. Formerly known as Project 22220, once enter in service the ships of the class will be the largest and most powerful icebreakers ever constructed. As of February 2018, two ships were launched and one is under construction at Baltic Shipyard in Russia.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe first ship, Arktika (\u0410\u0440\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u2013 Arctic), was laid down in November 2013 and is expected to enter service in 2018. Launched on 16 June 2016, the ship will be the world's largest and the most powerful icebreaker surpassing the 50 Let Pobedy.\u000aThe second ship of this class, Sibir \u2013 (\u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u044c \u2013 Siberia), was laid down on 26 May 2015 at Baltic Shipyard. On 1 July 2016, the hull of Sibir, one third of the ship and weighing 3,500 t, was shifted 125 meters (410 ft) to the place of the launched Arktika icebreaker, where construction will be completed. The shift made place for the start of the construction of the hull of the icebreaker Ural \u2013 (\u0423\u0440\u0430\u043b \u2013 Ural). Construction of the Ural started on 25 July 2016.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Design and construction ==\u000aLK-60Ya-class ships have an overall length of 173 metres (568 ft) and breadth of 34 metres (112 ft). The design draught is 10.5 metres (34 ft) and a minimal operating draught is 8.55 metres (28.1 ft). The dual-draught design will enable ships to operate in both Arctic waters and mouths of polar rivers. LK-60Ya ships have a displacement of 33,540 t, or 25,450 t without ballast.\u000aLK-60Ya ships will be equipped with two RITM-200 nuclear reactors, with a thermal capacity of 175 MW each. The propulsion power of this class of ships will be 60 MW which is why this class is sometimes referred as LK-60. LK-60Ya has been classified by the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping (RMRS) as the ice class, Icebreaker9. The maximum icebreaking capability of LK-60Ya-class vessels is 2.8 m (9.2 ft). The vessels are intended for the Northern Sea Route along the Russian Arctic coast.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Next generation ==\u000aIn May 2015 it was also reported that Russia had made a principal decision on the development of the conceptual design for a new nuclear-powered icebreaker. According to Sergey Kirienko, Director General of State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom, the new icebreaker could move across the Arctic ice of thickness up to 4.5 metres (15 ft). The new icebreaker will reportedly have the propulsion power of 110 MW. If built this new icebreaker would be almost twice as powerful as the LK-60Ya-class icebreakers. The LK-110Ya-class nuclear icebreaker (\u041b\u041a-110\u042f) will be capable of ensuring year-round navigability of the Northern Sea Route. The design is expected to be finalized by 2016. The vessel with a 50-meter (160 ft) beam will match large tankers.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Ships ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aShipbuilding in Russia\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVMarkkleeberg Nord is a railway station in Markkleeberg, Saxony, Germany. The station is located on the Leipzig\u2013Hof railway. The train services are operated by Deutsche Bahn. The station was opened with the commissioning of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. It is located on the suburban tracks, line number 6377, and because of the space needed for the platform, the main line between Leipzig-Connewitz and Gaschwitz has been reduced to one track since 2013.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Train services ==\u000aThe following services currently call at the station:\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a Media related to Haltepunkt Markkleeberg-Nord at Wikimedia Commons

aVAlsodes barrioi, the Cabreria spiny-chest frog, is a species of frog in the Alsodidae family, endemic to Chile; it is only known from its type locality in the Cordillera de Nahuelbuta, Malleco Province. However, it is relatively abundant at the type locality. These frogs can be found under logs or stones close to mountain streams. The surrounding vegetation mainly comprises Nothofagus dombeyi and Araucaria araucana. The habitat is being afforested by introduced pines, and harvesting these would have dramatic consequences for the streams where these frogs breed.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVInkle and Yarico is a comic opera first staged in London, England in August 1787, with music by Samuel Arnold and a libretto by George Colman the Younger.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000aInkle, an English trader, is shipwrecked in the West Indies, and survives with the help of Yarico, an Indian maiden. They fall in love, but when Inkle returns to his civilization, he plans to sell Yarico into slavery to recover his financial losses while he marries a woman, Narcissa, who will give him the social standing he wants. In the end, Narcissa marries another, and Inkle remains with Yarico.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Origins ==\u000aThe supposedly true story first appeared in Richard Ligon's book A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbadoes (1657).\u000aRichard Steele's Spectator printed another version in March 1711, in which Yarico is a Native American, sold into slavery while bearing Inkle's child.\u000a\u000a\u000a== 18th-century performances ==\u000aThe opera was highly successful, performed 98 times at the Haymarket Theatre, and a total of 164 performances on London stages by 1800. One of the most famous actresses to play the part of Yarico was Elizabeth Satchell. There were also performances in Dublin (1787), Jamaica (1788), New York (1789), Philadelphia (1790), Calcutta (1791), Boston (1794), and Charleston (1794).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Modern revival ==\u000aInkle and Yarico only survives in vocal score.\u000aIn 1996, composer Roxanna Panufnik was commissioned by the Holders Opera Festival, Barbados, to recompose the opera for steel pan and modern symphony orchestra. The production premiered at the festival on 15 March 1997, featuring the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with British soloist Rachel Hayward performing the solo pan part.\u000aIn 1997 Straydog Theatre, under the direction of Simon Godwin and the music direction of Peter Tregear, performed the work in the historic Cambridge Festival Theatre. Tregear reconstructed the score for the vocal and instrumental forces that Samuel Arnold had at his disposal at the Haymarket Theatre. The production was remounted for a season at the Battersea Arts Centre in 1998.\u000aComposer James McConnel was commissioned to compose a score for Inkle'n Yarico in 1997, and this was performed at the 1999 Edinburgh Festival starring Michael McCarthy (Inkle) and Natalie Tinn (Yarico).\u000aIn 2006, another reconstruction of Arnold's original opera was performed by Opera East at Magdalene College, Cambridge, conducted by Oliver Gooch and directed by Alistair Boag. The libretto was prepared by Richard Luckett and the score was orchestrated by Benjamin Chewter for the forces that Samuel Arnold had at his disposal at the Haymarket Theatre.\u000aIn 2015 John and Jodie Kidd produce a new musical based on the story at the London theatre workshop. General managed by Crow and Elk. It ran from 17 February - 28 March. Composed by James McConnel and lyrics by Carl Miller. Directed by Emily Grey, Musical Director Zara Nunn, Lighting Design Matt Haskins, Set and costume design Sarah Beaton.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aDavid Brion Davis (1966).
