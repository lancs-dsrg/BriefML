aVMaurice Percy Ashley CBE (4 September 1907 \u2013 26 September 1994) was a noted historian of the 17th Century and a former editor of The Listener. He published over thirty books, of which his Financial and Commercial Policy Under the Commonwealth Protectorate (1934) achieved wide academic influence, while his biographies Cromwell (1937) and General Monck (1976) received particular praise.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Background and education ==\u000aAshley was educated at St Paul's School and New College, Oxford, where he won the Stanhope Essay Prize (1928, 'Republicanism in the reign of Charles II') and the Gladstone Memorial (1930, 'The rise of Latitudinarianism in the Church of England'), and achieved first-class honours in Modern History in 1929. He went on to take a DPhil, studying under David Ogg, and it was his doctoral thesis that became Financial and Commercial Policy Under the Commonwealth Protectorate. Ashley's father worked as an official at the Board of Trade.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aIn 1929 he was appointed literary assistant to Winston Churchill, who had just begun work on his biography Marlborough: His Life and Times. Ashley provided Churchill with original material from archives in Britain and Europe, earning £300 a year for this half-time employment. Although he was unimpressed by Ashley's socialistic views, Churchill praised his "competence and industry as an historical investigator". Ashley later wrote Churchill as Historian (1968), a perceptive analysis of Churchill's methods.\u000aAshley's career as a journalist began when he joined the staff of the Manchester Guardian as a leader writer in 1933, moving to The Times in 1937 as a foreign sub-editor. He continued to write, publishing Oliver Cromwell: the Conservative Dictator in 1937 and his own short book on Marlborough in 1939. He was briefly editor of Britain Today in 1939-40 but in 1940 enlisted in the Grenadier Guards, later being transferred to the Intelligence Corps. By 1945 he had achieved the rank of major.\u000aAfter World War II, he joined the BBC's weekly publication, The Listener, as Deputy Editor and was appointed Editor in 1958, in which job he remained until retiring in 1967. He broadened the range of the journal, which had been a vehicle for the text of selected broadcasts and criticism of radio and then television programmes. Under Ashley, The Listener's book reviews played a leading role in killing off the 19th-century tradition of anonymous reviewing.\u000aAmong a number of books, Ashley's publications in this period included his The Greatness of Oliver Cromwell (1957), a substantial revision of his earlier view of Cromwell, and The Glorious Revolution of 1688 (1966). After retiring from The Listener, the rate of his publications increased, helped by a two-year research fellowship at Loughborough University. This period saw the publication of his studies of Charles II, James II, Prince Rupert, and his General Monck (1977), regarded as one of his best books. His last book, The Battle of Naseby and the Fall of King Charles I (1992), appeared when he was 85.\u000aAshley was awarded a CBE in 1978 and a DLitt from Oxford in 1979. He was President of the Cromwell Association from 1961 to 1977. He married twice, first to Phyllis Griffiths, with whom he had a son and a daughter, and second to Patricia Entract.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVOn the Up is a British situation comedy written by Bob Larbey. It ran for three series, from 4 September 1990 to 2 November 1992.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot summary ==\u000aTony Carpenter is a self-made millionaire who turned his South London minicab firm into a successful chauffeur-driven car service. He lives in a large detached mansion in Esher, surrounded by Rolls Royces and BMWs, with a domestic staff who respect him, and who he adores; Witty and insolent butler/driver Sam (who is also a childhood friend of Tony), acerbic secretary Maggie and cook Mrs Wembley (responsible for the series' catch-phrase of "Just the one", used to respond to the offer of a sherry even if it was her third or fourth).\u000aDespite all these advantages, Tony's life is full of conflict:\u000aHis working-class background and sensibilities make him uncomfortable with the idea of having domestic staff, and in dealing with local snobs.\u000aNothing he does seems to please his snooty wife Ruth, who hates his downmarket behaviour, constantly suspects him of infidelity with either his secretary Maggie or friend & model Dawn (both of whom are significantly younger than herself), and cannot abide the "chummy" relationship he has with "servants".\u000aThen there is daughter Stephanie, away from home at a Public School and thus being inculcated with upper / middle class sensibilities, who is embarrassed by both her father's differing outlook, and by the unsettled relationship between her parents.\u000aFinally there is his mother, who is still living in a South London terrace, and never seems impressed with his achievements, finding herself unable to understand why he lives "all the way over there" (in reality about 14 miles away) in his big house.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cast ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Regular ===\u000aDennis Waterman as Tony Carpenter, the lead character, owner of a luxury car hire business in the Surrey "Stockbroker Belt" and ardent supporter of Charlton Athletic. Although he's proud to be a "self-made man" and enjoys the good life his success has brought, Tony is unashamed of his working class roots and treats his staff more like friends, to the frustration of his wife.\u000aSam Kelly as Sam Jones, a friend of Tony since their days at Clapham Parochial School. An ex-Merchant Seaman, Sam was the first driver he ever employed, and now works as chauffeur to the Carpenter family. Although Tony is his boss, Sam still behaves more like a friend towards him and isn't afraid to criticise his behaviour. Sam has feelings for Maggie but believes she prefers Tony; however, in the final episode the two get together.\u000aJoan Sims as Mrs. Fiona Wembley, the Carpenter family's cordon bleu cook. She is something of a confidante and mother figure for the others in the house and becomes upset if Tony isn't eating properly. Fond of sherry - leading to her largely inaccurate catchphrase "just the one" - her tippling is indugled by Tony; when she fears the sack because Ruth is returning home, she confides in Sam that she worries another employer wouldn't be so understanding. Late in series one it's revealed that she never actually married Mr Wembley, as he was killed in the Korean war before they could.\u000aJenna Russell as Maggie Lomax, a young Scottish secretary of strong socialist leanings. She is highly efficient and regularly saves Tony's bacon when things go wrong. She and Ruth make no secret of disliking each other, something which largely stems from Ruth's (accurate) suspicion that Maggie has feelings for Tony. Maggie later gets over Tony and starts a relationship with Sam in the final episode.\u000aJudy Buxton as Ruth Carpenter, who is described in the title song as regarding her husband as a "bit of rough". She enjoys the good life Tony's money provides but is constantly frustrated by his tendency to treat the staff as friends and his disdain for her upper class friends. She has an on-off lover, Stephen, for whom she leaves Tony more than once.\u000aMichelle Hatch as Dawn, a lifelong friend-of-the-family and currently a Lingerie Model. Although she enjoys modelling, she is worried about being seen as a dumb blonde and, with Maggie's help, begins taking adult learning classes. She mostly sees Tony as a father figure, but in one episode attempts to seduce him.\u000aVanessa Hadaway as Stephanie Carpenter, Ruth and Tony Carpenter's teenage daughter, who attends a very exclusive boarding school. Although both her parents love her, she often ends up a pawn in their power games, with both trying to buy her affection with expensive gifts. Seen as spoilt by the staff, Stephanie's attitude improves somewhat when she gets some tough but genuine love from her grandmother.\u000aDora Bryan (series 1) then Pauline Letts (series 2 and 3) as Mrs Carpenter Senior, Tony's Mum. Proudly working class and an ardent supporter of the Labour Party, she thinks Tony has forgotten his roots. She and Ruth share a mutual dislike.\u000aFiona Mollison as Jane Webster (Series 2-3), from nearby Cobham, the mother of Stephanie's school friend Marina. She becomes a new love interest for Tony and is liked by his staff, with Mrs Wembley even allowing her to call her "Fiona".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Recurring ===\u000aJenny Lee as Mrs Purvis, Stephanie's Headmistress\u000aWilliam Lucas as Sir Douglas Hoyle, Mrs Wembley's suitor\u000aBunny May as Barry, Office Manager of Tony Carpenter's car hire business\u000aPaul Weakley as the Singing Gardener\u000aJohn Harding as Stephen, Ruth's one-off boyfriend and a solicitor\u000a\u000a\u000a== Music ==\u000aThe open titles are accompanied by the 1st movement of the Handel concerti grossi Op.6 No.11 in A major - a classical instrumental piece, played by the Guildhall String Ensemble.

aVLarry Brown, Jr. (born November 30, 1969) is a former American football cornerback in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys and the Oakland Raiders. He is mostly known for being named the MVP of Super Bowl XXX. Brown was a starting cornerback on all three Dallas Cowboys championship teams of the nineties. He attended Texas Christian University (TCU) in Fort Worth, Texas.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early years ==\u000aHe was a two-sport athlete at Los Angeles High School, earning All-City honors in football and track.\u000aAfter not receiving any scholarship offers, he began his collegiate career at Los Angeles Southwest College as a running back. He was moved to cornerback during his sophomore season, at the end of which he transferred to Texas Christian University.\u000aAt TCU he was a starter from his first game, leading the team in pass deflections during his senior season.\u000aIn 1990, he was invited to the Blue\u2013Gray Football Classic where he earned MVP honors.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Professional career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Dallas Cowboys (first stint) ===\u000aBrown was drafted in the 12th round of the 1991 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys. Although there weren't many expectations for him at the start of preseason, he surprised the coaches with his play, even though he quit training camp for a few days because of personal reasons and also had a brief hospitalization that was thought to be appendicitis.\u000aHe became the first Cowboys rookie to start at cornerback since Ron Francis in 1987. He was also named to the NFL all-rookie team. In the Cowboys 52-17 win over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVII, Brown recorded an interception in the second quarter.\u000aIn 1995 with the Cowboys having discussions to possibly sign the flashy free agent cornerback Deion Sanders, Brown was on his way to becoming a nickelback until Kevin Smith tore his achilles tendon in the first game of the 1995 season against the New York Giants on Monday Night Football. The move went from a luxury to a need and Sanders was signed the following week, while Brown remained in the starting lineup and responded with the best season of his career, recording 6 interceptions (tied for the team lead), 124 return yards, and two touchdowns.\u000aThat year the Cowboys reached Super Bowl XXX, where Brown became the first cornerback to win the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award and the first defensive back since 1972 to do it. In that game, Brown's two interceptions of Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Neil O'Donnell helped lift the Cowboys to their third championship in four seasons. The award and acclaim he received was especially poignant considering the death of his young son earlier in the season. Brown also had a key 28-yard interception return against the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game prior to the Super Bowl.\u000aBrown was a pivotal member of 3 Super Bowl championship teams and although he was considered the weak link of the defense, he more than held his own against some of the best wide receivers in NFL history, like Jerry Rice, Art Monk, Cris Carter and Sterling Sharpe. Rice had some terrible games playing against him, which led Brown to claim that he owned Rice, a statement that came back to haunt him after the 1994 NFC Championship Game, during which, Rice caught a 28-yard touchdown reception against Brown. The score came just before halftime, and put the 49ers up by three scores.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Oakland Raiders ===\u000aBrown became a free agent immediately after his Super Bowl MVP performance and used his award as leverage to gain a lucrative contract with the Oakland Raiders: five years, $12.5 million with $3.5 million guaranteed. But he was a disappointment and was waived after playing just 12 games in two years for the Raiders.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Dallas Cowboys (second stint) ===\u000aHe returned to Dallas for the 1998 season, which would be the last year of his playing career. He retired with 14 career interceptions, which he returned for a total of 210 yards and two touchdowns. He also recorded two fumble recoveries.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aCurrently, Brown is a cohost of The Dallas Cowboys Radio Network Pregame and Postgame Shows on 105.3 The Fan, the flagship station of the Dallas Cowboys Radio Network.\u000aHe also played himself in an episode of Married... with Children. He was named Number 3 in NFL Top 10 for One Shot Wonders.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aBrown's stats\u000aDallas cornerback has bounced back from family tragedy\u000aLarry Brown on IMDb

aVCavan\u2013Monaghan is a parliamentary constituency represented in Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Irish parliament or Oireachtas. The constituency elects 4 deputies (Teachtaí Dála, commonly known as TDs). The method of election is the single transferable vote form of proportional representation (PR-STV).\u000a\u000a\u000a== History and boundaries ==\u000aFrom its creation in 1977 to 2016, the constituency spanned the entire area of both County Cavan and County Monaghan, taking in Cavan town, Monaghan town, Clones, Cootehill, Belturbet, Bailieborough, Castleblayney and Carrickmacross, and was a 5-seat constituency.\u000aIt was created under the terms of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1974, as part of the redistribution of constituencies also known as the Tullymander. The constituency of Cavan\u2013Monaghan has been used for elections since the 1977 general election. It replaced the two separate constituencies of Cavan and Monaghan that previously covered the area.\u000aAt the 2016 general election, 36 electoral divisions in the west of County Cavan were transferred to the Sligo\u2013Leitrim constituency and Cavan\u2013Monaghan became a 4-seat constituency.\u000aThe Electoral (Amendment) (Dáil Constituencies) Act 2013 defines the constituency as:\u000a"The county of Monaghan and the county of Cavan, except the part thereof which is comprised in the constituency of Sligo\u2013Leitrim." In 2017 the constituency commission amended this act due to population boundaries. It stated that after at the next General Election west Cavan would be reunited with the rest of The Cavan-Monaghan constituency.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Constituency profile ==\u000aCavan\u2013Monaghan is predominately rural with 75% of the population living outside the main towns. Manufacturing, construction and agriculture are the largest sectors of the local economy. In the 2000s there was an influx of people moving to south-east Cavan from Dublin, benefiting from the low house prices and good transport links to the capital.\u000aDue to its proximity to the border the constituency has historically been strongly Republican; hunger striker Kieran Doherty won a seat in the 1981 general election as an Anti H-Block candidate. In recent elections the constituency has seen mainly a three-way fight between Fine Gael, Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil, with the Labour Party traditionally polling poorly.\u000a\u000a\u000a== TDs ==\u000aNote: The columns in this table are used only for presentational purposes, and no significance should be attached to the order of columns. For details of the order in which seats were won at each election, see the detailed results of that election.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Elections ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2016 general election ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2011 general election ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2007 general election ===\u000aRory O'Hanlon was Ceann Comhairle at the dissolution of the 29th Dáil and therefore deemed to be returned automatically.

aVJackson Krall Jr. (born October 12, 1949) is a drum maker.\u000aBorn in Detroit, through the years Jackson's instruments have found their way into the hands of the world's greatest drummers and percussionists, and can be heard on recordings as well as in live performance by many bands, orchestras, and the most popular Broadway and Off-Broadway shows like "Lion King" and "Blue Man Group". In the early 1980s, under the leadership of Toni and Celia Nogueira, Jackson was a founding member and helped write the bylaws of New York's first samba school, the now legendary Empire.\u000aDuring the next several years he studied, played and paraded with all the great Brazilian percussionists living in or passing through New York at the time. Eventually Empire Loisaida faded into history, but Jackson remained and continues making instruments and playing avant Jazz drums in New York City.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000aThe New York Times, June 22, 2007, "A Trumpeter in His 80s Feeds the Fires of His Revolution", Nate Chinen, New York City, https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/22/arts/music/22visi.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print/our-chopin/\u000aThe Village Voice, May 12, 2002, "Our Chopin, A Gift From Cecil Taylor", Gary Giddins, New York City, http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-03-12/music/our-chopin/\u000aThe New York Times, August 8, 1997, "Frantic Poetry on Piano", Ben Rattlif, New York City, https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/08/arts/frantic-poetry-on-piano.html\u000aImprojazz, January 2000, "Jackson Krall: Interview", Marc Chaloin, France.\u000aAuthor unknown, "Jackson Krall, Artist In Detail", Cleanfeed-Records.com, August 31, 2012, http://www.cleanfeed-records.com/artista.asp?intID=125\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a"A Brief History of the Drum Kit" by Jackson Krall

aVThe Tait trains were a wooden bodied Electric Multiple Unit train that operated on the suburban railway network of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. They were introduced in 1910 by the Victorian Railways as steam locomotive hauled cars, and converted to electric traction from 1919 when the Melbourne electrification project was underway. The trains derived their name from Sir Thomas James Tait, the chairman of commissioners of the Victorian Railways from 1903 to 1910. The first cars were built during 1909 with the last entering service in 1952.\u000aThe trains were initially known as "Sliding Door" trains, as opposed to the Swing Door then in service. They were later known as Reds or Red Rattlers from the 1950s when the blue-painted Harris trains were introduced.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Layout ==\u000a\u000aTait trains had a partly open saloon layout, with bench seats running across the train, the saloon being divided by partitions into a number of smaller areas. Each seating aisle was provided with its own exterior sliding door.\u000aIncandescent lighting, a ceiling with pressed tin patterns, luggage racks above head height, and beautifully stained woodgrain walls were fitted inside each compartment. Interiors were split into smoking and no-smoking compartments until late 1978 with the abolition of smoking on trains, and carriages were designated as first or second class until 1958 when one class suburban travel was introduced.\u000aThe exterior of the trains were of two main styles: the original cars had a clerestory roof, and those built from the late 1920s onward had a simpler arched roof.\u000aFrom 1971 the interior was simplified to cut maintenance costs, with some doorway windows being replaced by metal and plywood, and the wooden latticed sun blinds being removed. The motor bogies on the trains were originally of pressed steel construction, being changed for a new design in cast steel in the 1930s.\u000a\u000a\u000a== In service ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Pre-electrification ===\u000aThe carriages were constructed before electrification, with the intention of later retrofitting of equipment.\u000aThe carriages were grouped as the P type, with codes like ACP indicating the passageway connecting most of the compartments, rather than the older carriage style with each compartment isolated from its neighbours. In the 1910 recoding project the P was changed to a normal-size, normal-font letter, i.e. ACP. However, most diagrams show the raised letter with the newer code, perhaps because they were drawn during the construction phase, around the same time as the recoding was being planned out.\u000aAll carriages were roughly 62 ft (19 m) over buffers, 19 ft (5.8 m) tall and 9 ft 6 in (2.90 m) across, though there was some variation. All compartments were linked with a through-corridor, though internal sliding doors were placed every three compartments from one end. The carriages were not initially marked for Smoking or Non-Smoking.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== ACP, AP, BCP, BP ====\u000aInitial construction saw 48 ACP cars, 62 AP, 18 BCP and 62 BP carriages built in the period 1910 to 1913. The AP and 62 BP carriages were of identical design with capacity for 92 passengers each across nine compartments, except that the second class BP carriages had lower-quality seating. Similarly, the ACP and BCP cars shared a design in every way other than the seating; these carriages were fitted with eight compartments for 82 passengers, and the ninth compartment was repurposed for a train guard. This last compartment was fitted with a raised cupola for sighting of signals.\u000aFrom 1915 more carriages were constructed as the electrification project gathered pace and requirements were locked in. Further ACP carriages 49\u2013106, and BCP carriages 19\u201380 were constructed in 1915\u20131916. However, these did not have the standard carriage bogies; instead they were fitted with plate-framed bogies intended for later fitting of traction motors. The cars also varied in having a well in the roof designed for later provision of electrical equipment\u2014motors, pantographs etc. This gives a rough indication of when the decision was made to proceed with 1500 VDC overhead wiring for Melbourne's electrification, as against earlier proposals for third-rail equipment.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Conversions for electrification ===\u000aConversions started in 1917, in preparation for electrification trials and driver training on the Flemington Racecourse line and later the Sandringham line.\u000aSome carriages were stored after conversion, awaiting traffic requirements. It is thought that these vehicles were held until around 1919/1920.\u000aCarriages converted kept their existing codes, but with D, M or T appended indicating Driver's compartment, Motor car (with drivers compartment) or Trailer. However, in 1921 the system was regarded as too complex, and coding was simplified with all motored and driving carriages becoming second class, and all trailers becoming first class.\u000aThe conversion project was completed in 1922.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Driving motors\u2014ACPM, BCPM, M ====\u000aFrom 1917 through 1921, ACP and BCP carriages were withdrawn from steam service in preparation for electrification. The carriages taken for motor conversion had been pre-built with this in mind, with heavier underframes, bogies designed with traction motors in mind and a well in the roof for a pantograph to be fitted.\u000aSeventeen of the ACP 49\u2013106 range were recoded to ACPM. From 1916 on, a further 26 ACPM cars were built, bringing the fleet to 45. But in 1922 the entire class was recoded M, taking on numbers 201M\u2013284M.\u000aSimilarly, 28 of the BCP cars in the range 19\u201380 were recoded to BCPM, and in 1916 the class grew by 30 units. In the 1921 renumbering the ex-BCP/BCPM class became 294M-385M.\u000aAdditional M cars 285\u2013293 and 386\u2013411 were built new in 1922. Further cars were built from 1925\u20131926 with curved roofs, taking numbers 412M\u2013441M. 442M and 443M were rebuilt from 18M and 44M, formerly Swing-door motors. These carriages ended up having the thinner Swing-door underframe with the larger Tait body, giving a rather unbalanced look. The carriages entered service in 1936. Following this, 444M through 461M were built in the period 1944\u20131949, and the last of these entered service in 1951.\u000aIn 1968 four motors, 300M, 398M, 244M and 397M were modified with cabs at both ends, taking on new numbers 470M\u2013473M. These were mainly used on the Eltham/Hurstbridge and Alamein lines, where even a two-car set could not be justified in offpeak times.\u000aIn 1979 the new deliveries of the Hitachi fleet were catching up with the Tait numbering block, so some carriages were renumbered into free sections of the roster. This started with the gap 462M\u2013469M and 474M\u2013499M, and later cars took numbers of Tait motor cars previously scrapped. By 1983 deliveries of the Comeng fleet made even this measure insufficient, so the 19x remaining Motors simply had a 1 prefix added to their numbers, i.e. 383M became 1383M.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Parcel motors CM ====\u000aIn 1921 a decision was made to supplement the mail/newspaper distribution fleet with double-ended motor cars, with the interior organised like a typical bogie guards' van of the CE/CW/CV types.\u000aCoaches 1CM and 2CM entered service in 1921, with a capacity of 25 tons each. In 1923 they were joined by a third vehicle, 3CM. This was partially paid for by the Electrical Engineering Branch, with a modification to the design by addition of a centre cupola for viewing of overhead wires. This van was run with the normal fleet, but was made available for overhead wire inspection if and when required. CMs 4 and 5 entered service in 1925 and 1926 respectively, both using the new arch/curved roof style between their two cupolas.\u000aThe fleet was used for cash transport and as a staff-only taxi service, for the use of crew members scheduled to start work between 3am and 5am (before the regular services started operating).\u000aExtra coaches were built from the mid 1950s using Swing Door carriages.\u000aThe parcels coach traffic dried up in 1988 when a railways' policy change saw a change to road transport. Correspondence to stations is now delivered on a few select trains per week, noted in advance.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Driving trailers\u2014ACPD, BCPD, D ====\u000aWhen planning the initial electrification project, it was expected that some lines could be operated with single-carriage or two-carriage trains instead of requiring a full consist. The single-carriage, double-ended motors were sourced from the Swingdoor fleet. However, some Driving Trailer carriages were sourced from the Tait fleet. While it was initially thought that around twenty of these carriages would be needed for service, only eleven were converted in the early stages of the electrification project.\u000aSix ACP carriages (16\u201317, 23, 92\u201393 and 52) and five BCP carriages (2\u20133, 8\u20139 and 18) were rewired and recoded with a "D" appended in the first half of 1921. New identities for the ACPD series were 1\u20132, 8, 10\u201312, while the BCPD cars kept their old numbers of 2\u20133, 8\u20139 and 18.\u000aIn 1922 with the class simplification, the last of the three ACPD cars were converted to M motorised carriages 244, 245 and 204 in 1922. These three had previously been heavier-underframe carriages. The remaining eight driving trailers were recoded to D 201\u2013202 and 208 (ex ACPD) and 211, 204\u2013207 (ex BCPD) respectively. Further conversions direct from ACP and BCP carriages saw the class rise to eighteen D carriages, numbers 201-218.\u000aIn 1940 carriage 244T, originally 44AP, was converted to driving trailer 225D.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== "Ringer" Trailers, T ====\u000aThe 48 remaining, lighter-framed ACP and BCP carriages not converted to driving trailers were classed as "ringer" trailer cars, with the guard's compartment equipment removed and that slightly larger compartment being made available to passengers. This compartment was identifiable by the lack of the word "GUARD" and a white circle painted on the door; the circle indicated to crew members that the vans were not fitted with the handbrake and emergency brake taps normally found in carriages with the guards' raised profile. Because of the larger area available, passengers tended to store prams and luggage in these areas.\u000aThe Ringer trailers had formerly been ACP 15, 19\u201322, 24\u201348 and BCP 1, 4\u20137 and 121\u2013133 (ex. ACP 1\u201313). They took the number range 263T to 286T (ex ACP 25\u201348), 349T to 361T (ex ACP 1\u201313, later BCP 121\u2013143), 362T to 367T (ex ACP 15, 19\u201322, 24) and 368T\u2013372T (ex BCP 1 and 4\u20137).\u000aFrom 1926\u201327 the first batch of Ringer Trailer to Driving Trailer conversions were made, with trailers 365 and 368\u2013372 converted to 224D, 219D, 220D, 221D, 222D and 223D.\u000aThen from 1965 to 1972 all bar two of the remaining Ringer trailers (349T and 350T) were converted to full Driving Trailers and coded randomly into in the range 226D\u2013265D.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Trailers\u2014APT, BPT, T ====\u000aThe plain trailer carriages were converted between 1919 and 1922 for electric traction. This involved removal of the then-standard gas lighting and refitting with electric lighting, as well as through-jumper cable connections for the driving and motor cars expected to operate on each end.\u000aThe T fleet comprised the original 124 AP and BP carriages.\u000aThe AP fleet was initially relettered to APT, and the BP fleet to BPT. When the classes were simplified in 1921, only 39 APT and 28 BPT cars had been refitted with the required electrical equipment. Further conversions were straight from AP/BP to T. From 1922 on, ex-AP cars had 200 added to their numbers to indicate the Tait/Sliding door fleet; for example 37AP became 37APT then 237T. The ex-BP cars were renumbered into the range 287-348, keeping the sequence i.e. 1BP became 287T and 62BP became 348T.\u000aAdditional carriages were built, numbers T380 to T400 in 1922, T401\u2013424 in 1926, and T427\u2013T442 between 1944 and 1952.\u000aAs noted above, trailer 244T was converted to driving trailer 225D. This happened in 1940.\u000a288T was temporarily recoded to second class, with a G car's shunting/braking equipment, in 1954.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Experimental Trailer 201BT ====\u000aAs a testbed for the new Harris cars then being developed, the body of incomplete 441T was reworked to a more modern design and released into service in 1950, with three sets of doors per side. The car was coded 201BT, and lasted in service until 1984.\u000aInternally, the car was divided into three second-class compartments; the outer two at a little under 17 ft across and the middle compartment at a little under 23 ft. One compartment was reserved for smokers until 1976, when smoking was abolished on the suburban network.\u000aThe car went through a number of changes in seating arrangements and door types (and post-76, internal partitions), with seated capacity ranging from 70 to 90 (73 being the most commonly quoted figure) and 164\u2013175 standing passengers in crush load conditions.\u000aIt was intended that the car be preserved, but it is thought to have been scrapped in 1994.\u000aA replacement 441T to the regular design was built and entered service in 1952.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Gas-lit trailers\u2014G ====\u000aAdditional to the regular trailers, a project was undertaken to recycle older carriage underframes from the Swing Door conversion project. Some of these frames went to the PL type carriages, but others were used to create the very similar G type cars. These were initially numbered 1G\u201397G, built 1923\u20131926 with clerestory roofs, identical passenger facilities to the T series trailers 380\u2013400 with nine compartments and a seating capacity of 82. Externally the cars were fitted with handrails and shunters brake equipment at the west end. This was a temporary provision until the planned conversion of these carriages to driving trailers, but eventually the equipment proved safe enough for daily use and the cars were left as-is. The brake equipment was used when shunting an M-T-G unit onto an M-T-T-M block (usually at Jolimont) for building up of trains for the peak hours.\u000aDuring Easter and for the three weeks around Christmas and New Year's, the G cars were withdrawn from suburban service and used to boost the country rail network's capacity. This was justified by the fewer commuters at the time. The carriages had been specially fitted with alternate gas-lighting equipment (hence the G code).\u000aAdditional carriages 98G to 103G were built as part of new sets in 1944, with pairs entering service in 1944, 1947 and 1950. These cars were identical to their predecessors except that they were fitted with the more modern curved roofs.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Set configuration ===\u000aThe Tait trains originally entered service as six-car sets, the majority made up of three "M" cars and three trailers. From the 1920s sets were extended to seven-car sets, with the introduction of the "G" trailer cars. These sets were made up of a four-car "block" and a three-car "unit", usually operating as an M-T-T-M+G-T-M set during peak hours. On quieter lines the three-car unit would be uncoupled and stored at Jolimont sidings between peaks.\u000aAs noted above, in peak traffic periods like Easter and the Christmas holiday season, the G type carriages were withdrawn from suburban service and repurposed in country trains as required.\u000aThe "D" type cars were the least common of the car types; only 18 cars were fitted with control equipment and coded "D" by 1923. The rest were known as "ringer" trailers, having a white ring on the door indicating the compartment was available for the use of passengers. These cars were paired with M cars and run either in pairs, i.e. M-D-M-D replacing an M-T-T-M set, or in some cases M-T-D sets ran on particularly flat, short-distance lines where late running, while annoying to the passengers, would not disrupt the entire system. One such example as the Altona Beach to Newport shuttle service, running hourly as of 1939.\u000aThe M-D+M-D sets became much more common when the fleet ballooned in 1964, with a "block" of cars made up M-D-M-D that could be split as required.\u000aMotor cars were sometimes paired back-to-back for what was known as "E" trains. These were formed with two M cars acting as locomotives, hauling a train of typical outer-suburban or country stock. These ran to Frankston, where the train would split and two steam engines would take portions on to Mornington and Stony Point, and to Lilydale where the train would split and two steam engines would take portions on to Healesville and Warburton. These runs were abolished in 1958 with the arrival of the Walker railmotors, and operational practice changed to connecting trains instead of through-carriages. A number of swing-door motor cars had been specially altered for E train use, but in practice they weren't always available and so Tait motors may have been required as a substitute.\u000aOne car operation commenced in 1968, after the conversion of 470M the previous year and the end of union disputes over their introduction.\u000aIn May 1968 an eight-car Tait train was tested on the Frankston line, made up of three motor cars and five trailers, entering service under the new timetable in August 1968. After 1973 these eight-car sets were reconfigured with a 50:50 motor\u2013trailer mix to avoid special rosters restricting three motor car sets to flatter lines.\u000aFrom 1973 three-car sets were also reintroduced, as M-T-D consists, or occasionally M-T-M sets. Six-car M-T-T-T-T-M consists were also formed for peak hour use. Both of these were restricted to the flatter lines, where the lack of power would not be a major issue.\u000aIn 1975, a 14-car Tait train ran between the North Melbourne and Royal Park substations, to test a new protective relay device.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== The Boat Train ====\u000aIn 1936 a short-lived experiment involved the exclusive use of six Tait carriages on a special train running from Flinders Street to Port Melbourne, to meet passengers off international ships. Called The Boat Train, the train was assembled using three M motor cars (242, 268, 380) and three T trailer cars (226, 321 and 330), in an M-T-M-T-T-M formation, likely as 242M-226T-268M-321T-330T-380M.\u000aThey were painted mid-blue, with silver roofs and black undergear. Red capital lettering was affixed to the roofs of the three M cars, above the middle compartments, with the name of the train. Floodlighting with incandescent globes was run along the sides of the carriage roofs, such that the entire train body was illuminated.[1]\u000aAfter final inspections by the three Railway Commissioners H. W. Clapp, N. C. Harris and M. J. Canny, and the architect A. V. Stephenson and the workshops manager H. V. James, the first run was scheduled for 7 March 1936. The consist departed Flinders Street station at 9:10am for Station Pier, to meet the Italian liner Esquilino. The return trip departed station pier at 10:15am. Following this, the train ran three return trips on the following Sunday night, to meet the SS Oronsay. These trains left Flinders Street at 10:30pm, 11:09pm and 11:32pm. [2]\u000aShipping companies would publish in newspapers their six-monthly planned departures from Port Melbourne (P&O, Orient, Shaw Savill, Aberdeen & Commonwealth to England and Matson to the USA); ships to be met by The Boat Train would have an additional comment that the train was to leave Flinders St Platform 10, about 90 minutes prior to the vessel's departure time.\u000aThe train ran as required until October 1939, when disappointing patronage and the outbreak of World War II caused the service to be withdrawn. The six carriages were restored to normal service, and continued until the general withdrawal of the Tait fleet.\u000aPhotos of the train are noted as PTC collection H 1792 and 1793. A copy of the train is available in Microsoft Train Simulator\u2014link & photo\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Overhead Inspection Train ====\u000aFor the purposes of inspection of overhead wiring, carriage 3CM was constructed to a modified design with an overhead compartment for inspectors to watch the way that the overhead wiring reacted to contact with pantographs.\u000aLater, 10CM was constructed with similar modifications from the normal design.\u000aInspection trains would often run with two randomly selected motor carriages, one either side of the inspection car which would have its own pantographs locked down.\u000aOn 6 October 1980 carriage 447M had a similar fitting added, and it was renamed the Greasing Car. It was painted bright yellow with most windows boarded over, and large black letters declaring "OVERHEAD INSPECTION" were painted on both sides. Internally thew car was fitted with a power generator and hydraulic equipment to lubricate the overhead wiring. The car was renumbered 1447M in 1983, and after a graffiti attack around 1995 it was painted all-over yellow.\u000aSometime in that period, 1447M was coupled with Harris motors 794M and 797M, with transition vans 320 and 329D (as 797-320-1447-329-794). The two Harris cars were fitted with rail greasing equipment for tight curves, and the five-piece train made regular runs around the electrified network. While 1447M was in all-over yellow and the two Harris cars in similar livery but with green/yellow Met stickers along the sides, the two D vans were in normal V/Line orange livery; the only alteration was the fitting of screw couplers at one end each to allow coupling to the Tait carriage.\u000aIn later years the Greaser train was withdrawn, and now small automatic greasing pots are attached to the rails at tight curves.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Equipment ==\u000aGeneral Electric traction equipment was fitted to the trains, of the same type as that in the Swing Door trains and enabling the trains to be operated in mixed sets using multiple-unit train control.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Conversions and alterations ==\u000aIncomplete trailer car 441T was converted to experimental trailer car 201BT in 1950 with double width sliding doors to test design features for the Harris train. Later, a new 441T was constructed.\u000aIn 1958 class designation on the suburban network was abolished, with all painted indications of former First- and Second-class ticketing requirements painted over within two days; it took a little while longer to standardise all seating, and until that happened there were stories of passengers rushing to the former first-class trailer cars for the more comfortable seating.\u000aFour motor cars were converted to double ended motors in 1968\u20131970 and renumbered 470M to 473M. These were mainly used on the Hurstbridge and Alamein routes.\u000aFrom the mid 1970s the cost of replacing damaged glass windows was becoming prohibitive, and so one in three windows was sheeted over, with plywood on the inside and painted steel on the outside. Some carriages were also fitted with communication doors and/or diaphragms allowing staff and passengers to walk between carriages, particularly on two-carriage trains.\u000aSmoking was abolished in 1978.\u000a447M was converted to an overhead inspection car in 1980.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Example roster (1981) ==\u000aRoster as at 19.10.1981:\u000aFor 7-car sets, first four are the Block, last three are the Unit.\u000aThe table totals 228 cars, with an additional 61 spare or undergoing painting, repair or scrapping.\u000aLowercase w and e indicate whether the car is facing west or east respectively, where applicable.\u000a7-car sets were typically used on the Epping and Hurstbridge lines, with 19 sets required in a typical morning peak hour. On weekends, the four-car blocks were used, with the three-car units stabled to save on operating costs. Anything spare was used on the North Melbourne (or occasionally Camberwell) group of lines, which at the time did not have a connection to the City Loop, where wooden trains had been banned account fire risk. 6-car sets would be used on the Sandringham route, split offpeak and shared with the St Kilda and Port Melbourne lines, and if a path could be found across the junction, Epping and Hurstbridge. A single 2-car set was used on the Epping-Hurstbridge shuttle weeknights, and on weekends the double-ended Motor car was used, with the driving trailer stabled. Two 2-car sets were used on the Saturday Camberwell-Alamein shuttle, with one pair on Sundays. From 4 October the Altona shuttle was discontinued, so the spare 2-car sets were coupled into a 6-car set and absorbed into that roster.\u000aIf being painted, Motors would be at Bendigo and all other types at Ballarat.\u000aCars renumbered have their previous identities noted.\u000aOther cars not listed in sets:\u000aOff Register / scrapping underway:\u000a235D w, 236D w both at Spotswood\u000a51G, 66G both at Spotswood, 78G at Newport\u000a242M201M at Newport, 283M, 310M, 329M, 346M, 407M, 412M, 496M353M, 497M352M at Spotswood, 400M, 493M379M* at Jolimont, 487M328M at Bendigo\u000a254T, 427T both at Spotswood, 350T\u000aSpare:\u000a15G, 56G, 98G\u000a238M, 251M, 260M, 269M217M, 277M223M, 289M, 388M, 408M, 452M, 483M321M, 484M359M, 489M386M\u000a205T, 224T, 230T, 236T, 251T, 292T, 301T, 302T, 306T, 419T, 423T, 425T, 436T\u000a201BT held for preservation\u000aRepairs:\u000a245M (wired for 60W globes), 284M, 295M, 364M, 380M, 384M, 417M, 445M376M, 459M, 465M313M\u000a389T, 396T\u000aPainting:\u000a89G, 102G\u000a267M, 268M216M, 281M227M, 477M316M\u000a406T, 430T, 442T\u000a\u000a\u000a== Retirement ==\u000aThe Tait trains were replaced from 1974 by the Hitachi trains sets, and later, the Comeng trains.\u000aFrom 1981, the last 37 of them began to be replaced by 50 Comeng trains. Tait trains were not allowed in the City Loop, due to fire hazard presented by their wooden bodies, so they spent most of their final years on the Port Melbourne, St Kilda and Sandringham lines. However, on 30 May 2015, when a news report aired about the 30th anniversary since the completion of the City Loop, a Tait train can be seen pulling into Museum station behind a news reporter at the beginning of the video.\u000aA large number of carriages were burned for scrap at Kingston. However, the large number of complaints from local residents ended the practice, and a program of public sales followed.\u000aDue to asbestos found in the brakeblocks, amongst other industrial problems, the last of the 7 Tait trains were withdrawn from service by 27 December 1984.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Preservation ==\u000a\u000aThe Elecrail division of Steamrail Victoria restored 470M to working order. It also has 341T under restoration. 327M, 472M and 2CM are stored.\u000aCarriages 317M, 381M, 208T and 230D were retained by the then Public Transport Corporation as an operational heritage set, plus 201BT was stored for possible restoration. They are now owned by VicTrack and in the care of Elecrail. due to concerns surrounding, among other issues, the lack of door locks, the cars were forbidden from operating on the Melbourne rail network from around 2004. Their first run since was on 12 November 2016, between two steam locomotives to provide motive power and air brakes, but with pantographs lowered and no internal lighting provided. The special was organised, from the West end, as D3639, 317M, 230D, 208T, 381M and K190, and operated by Steamrail Victoria and V/Line on behalf of the Level Crossing Removal Authority's festivals at Ormond, McKinnon and Bentleigh stations.\u000aOverhead inspection/greaser car 1447M is owned by VicTrack and stored.\u000aThe Mornington Railway has 98G, operational. Like much of the Mornington Railway stock, the car has been fitted with a thin silver band below the windowline.\u000aThe Daylesford Spa Country Railway has 4CM stored.\u000aMany Tait car bodies were sold privately. Several have been converted to railway-themed restaurants and many others are on private properties.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aVicsig.net Tait Trains

aVRocky Votolato (born March 8, 1977, Dallas, Texas, United States), is an American singer-songwriter.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aHe was raised in Frost, Texas, roughly 50 miles south of Dallas, until the age of 13. After his parents were divorced, his mother remarried and moved the family to the Pacific Northwest in 1991, where he attended Inglemoor High School in Kenmore, Washington. Alienated by his southern roots, the isolation led him to focus all of his attention on learning to play guitar and writing songs. Inspired by seeing many punk shows including bands like Jawbreaker and Fugazi, he started several different musical projects while in high school.\u000aWhen his former band Lying on Loot disbanded in 1996, Votolato, along with friends Rudy Gajadhar (drums) and Andrew Hartley (bass), started playing under the name Waxwing. His younger brother Cody (The Blood Brothers) soon joined the band on second guitar, and the band recorded their debut 7" for Henry's Finest Recordings. In 1999, Second Nature Recordings released their first full-length, entitled For Madmen Only. Blending straight-up rock with elements of post-hardcore, and Cody's metal reminiscent guitaring, Waxwing soon established a strong local following. The band then signed with Second Nature Recordings out of Kansas City, MO. The band then released three full-length albums: For Madmen Only in 1999, One for the Ride in 2000, and Nobody Can Take What Everybody Owns in 2002. By this time, the band's profile in the Seattle music scene had grown substantially, causing them to consistently sell out at local clubs like the Crocodile Cafe and The Paradox Theater.\u000aIn 1999, Votolato branched out from his work with Waxwing, having written a handful of songs which did not really fit in with their more aggressive, fast-tempo style. Along the way he has toured with the likes of Damien Jurado, Small Brown Bike, The Get Up Kids, The New Amsterdams, Owen and The Casket Lottery, members of the latter having provided assistance as backing musicians on occasion. His studio albums have also been littered with appearances from some of Seattle's finest musicians (including players in the bands Red Stars Theory, Sharks Keep Moving, The Blood Brothers, Death Cab for Cutie, and Pedro the Lion, and Sub Pop solo artist Rosie Thomas).\u000aOn the production side, Votolato has worked with Matt Bayles (Pearl Jam, Botch, Murder City Devils, Hayden) and Chris Walla (of Death Cab for Cutie). It is a creative input which has helped see Votolato progress stylistically with every release, from his low-key self-titled album released in 1999 - all pretty much recorded live - right through to his recent, alt-country, folk-esque offering, Makers. A video was shot for the first track of Makers, "White Daisy Passing" - a song which also appeared on an episode of the popular TV show The OC.\u000aVotolato also starred in the film The Edge of Quarrel, which he worked on with Dave Larson from Excursion Records. It also includes members of the Murder City Devils and Botch, and is about a gang war between straightedgers and punk rockers and his attempts to achieve peace between the two opposing groups.\u000aHe has been married to his wife, April Votolato, for over 10 years, and they live in Seattle with their two children.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Solo ===\u000aRocky Votolato (1999) (Status Recordings)\u000aRocky V/Seth Warren 7" (1999) (Redwood Records)\u000aA Brief History (2000) (Your Best Guess)\u000aRocky V/Suffering & The Thieves 7" (2002) (Velvet Blue Music)\u000aBurning My Travels Clean (LP) (2002) (Second Nature Recordings)\u000aThe Light and the Sound (EP) (2003) (Second Nature Recordings)\u000aSuicide Medicine (2003) (Second Nature Recordings)\u000aMakers (2006) (Second Nature Recordings) (Barsuk)\u000aEnd Like This (EP) (2007) (Second Nature Recordings)\u000aThe Brag and Cuss (2007) (Barsuk)\u000aTrue Devotion (2010) (Barsuk)\u000aTelevision of Saints (2012) (Undertow Music Collective)\u000aHospital Handshakes (2015) (No Sleep Records)\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Waxwing ===\u000aWaxwing 7" (1999) (Henry's Finest Recordings)\u000aFor Madmen Only (1999) (Second Nature Recordings)\u000aOne for the Ride (2000) (Second Nature Recordings)\u000aIntervention:Collection+Remix (2001) (Second Nature Recordings)\u000aNobody Can Take What Everybody Owns (2002) (Second Nature Recordings)\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Lying On Loot ===\u000aSplit 7" with State Route 522 (1996) (Henry's Finest Recordings)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial website

aVPanackelty (also spelt panacalty, panaculty, panackerty '"panaggie'" or abbreviated as panack) is a casseroled dish, traditional throughout the northeast of England and especially associated with Sunderland and County Durham consisting of meat (mainly corned beef) and root vegetables (mainly potatoes, onions and carrots) left to bake throughout the day in an oven pot on low heat or cooked slowly on a low heat in a pan, hence the name PANacalty. The dish exists in a number of local variations that differ in name, meat and vegetable content.\u000aAround the Humber estuary a version is known as pan aggie and consists of layers of bacon, corned beef and onions topped with either sliced or mashed potatoes.\u000aThe Northumberland version, pan haggerty, comprises potatoes, onions and cheese baked in a baking dish, while panackelty, in the Sunderland region, comprises leftover meat cooked slowly with leftover root vegetables made in a slow cooker or served in casserole dish left in the oven to simmer and if short of ingredients from night before would usually add more fresh root vegetables a tin of corned beef and sliced potatoes added on top. The dish is also sometimes cooked in a frying pan, or made in a large pan and served as a soup, which allows it to be left on the hob and later reheated.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of casserole dishes\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aDiscussion of panackelty variants\u000aPanhaggerty at Foods of England

aVBank of America Stadium is a 75,525-seat football stadium located on 33 acres (13 ha) in uptown Charlotte, North Carolina, United States. It is the home facility and headquarters of the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League. The stadium opened in 1996 as Ericsson Stadium before Bank of America purchased the naming rights in 2004. Former Panthers president Danny Morrison called it "[A] classic American stadium" due to its bowl design and other features.\u000aIn addition to the Panthers, the stadium hosts the annual Belk Bowl, which features teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC), and was supposed to host the annual ACC Championship Game through at least 2019. The game was moved in 2016 but reinstated in 2017. The largest crowd to ever attend a football game at the stadium was on December 5, 2015 when 74,514 fans watched the Clemson Tigers defeat the North Carolina Tar Heels 45-37 in the 2015 ACC Championship Game.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other sites considered for selection ==\u000aThe Panthers organization considered several possible sites for the stadium's location before choosing the Charlotte center city site. Part of the site was occupied by the historic Good Samaritan Hospital. One alternative was near NASCAR's Charlotte Motor Speedway and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in northeast Mecklenburg County. Another was at the intersection of I-85 and US 74 in western Gaston County. A popular option was to locate the facility near Carowinds amusement park, with the 50 yard line being on the state border of North Carolina and South Carolina.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Naming ==\u000aThe stadium was originally known as Carolinas Stadium, a name which remains in use for certain events such as FIFA matches. It opened in 1996 as Ericsson Stadium after the Swedish telecom company LM Ericsson purchased the naming rights to the stadium in a ten-year, $25 million agreement. In 2004, the stadium received its current name after Bank of America purchased the naming rights for 20 years. Since Bank of America acquired naming rights, many fans now refer to the stadium as either "The Bank", "The BOA", "The B of A", or "The Vault".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Stadium features ==\u000aBank of America Stadium has many unique external features. Aspects of the stadium's architecture, such as the three huge main entrances, incorporate the team's colors of black, process blue and silver. Arches that connect column supports on the upper deck resemble the shape of half a football, while several acres of numerous trees and landscaping surround the building. The stadium's architecture and design has been compared to that of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Soldier Field, among others. It's also received mentions for externally resembling "a fortress" instead of a stadium.\u000aEach of the stadium's entrances are flanked on both sides by two larger-than-life bronze panther statues, something unique throughout the entire NFL. These six statues are all named "Indomitable Spirit" and were installed in 1996. Each one depicts a crouching, snarling panther with green eyes; they are the largest sculptures ever commissioned in the United States. The names of the team's original PSL owners are engraved into each statue's base.\u000aAnother striking feature the stadium contains are its six light domes. These are found on top of the main entrances, two per entrance, and sit over a hundred feet in the air. Originally, they simply glowed the Panthers' unique 'process blue' every night. As the seasons wore on, the emitted light became less and less impressive and the domes started showing their age. During the 2014 renovations, the domes were rebuilt with LED systems. They can now be seen again projecting process blue nightly in various ways not possible with the original technology.\u000aAdditionally, the two people currently in the Panthers Hall of Honor, former team executive Mike McCormack and former Panthers linebacker and assistant coach Sam Mills, are honored with life-sized bronze statues outside the stadium. Before the 2014 renovations, the names of the hall of honor inductees were placed where the upper ribbon board now resides. These names (at least Mills') were subsequently repainted onto the top rear wall behind the last row of seats. Additionally, three marble copies of a quote about the stadium from team founder and owner Jerry Richardson were placed near the stadium's entrances in 2014.\u000aIn 2016, a statue was added in front of the stadium's north gate in celebration of Richardson's 80th birthday. The statue stands nearly 13 ft (3.96 m) tall and features larger than life sculptures of Richardson flanked on both sides by two panthers. One panther stands on its hind legs, claws bared, while the other crouches. All three sculptures have the same bronze color and both panthers have the green eyes of and physically resemble the "Indomitable Spirit" statues.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Carolina Panthers ==\u000a\u000aIn addition to hosting every Panthers home game since 1996, Bank of America Stadium has hosted seven playoff games. Carolina has also had over 150 consecutive sellouts at the stadium starting with the 2002 season.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Inaugural season ===\u000aThe Panthers played their inaugural season at Clemson University's Memorial Stadium while the stadium was being constructed. On August 3, 1996, the stadium played host to its first professional football game as the Panthers took on the Chicago Bears during the preseason. The inaugural kickoff was at 7:35 PM and Carolina won 30-12. The stadium's first regular season game took place on September 1, 1996 against Carolina's to-be division rival Atlanta; the Panthers won 29-6.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Playoff games ===\u000aIn 1996, on their way to their first NFC Championship Game, Carolina defeated the then-defending Super Bowl Champion Dallas Cowboys in the first playoff game the stadium hosted. Again they defeated the Cowboys on their way to Super Bowl XXXVIII in Houston in 2004. Carolina was handed their first ever home playoff loss, 33-13, by the Arizona Cardinals on January 10, 2009 in the divisional round. The Panthers suffered a second home playoff loss against the San Francisco 49ers 23-10 on January 12, 2014 in the same round. On January 3, 2015, the Panthers won their first home playoff game in 12 years, defeating the Arizona Cardinals 27-16. En route to their fourth NFC Championship game appearance, the Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks 31-24 in the divisional round on January 17, 2016. The Panthers defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49-15 in the NFC Championship game for their second NFC Championship in franchise history on January 24, 2016. This marked the first NFC Championship played and won at the stadium.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Weather events ===\u000aSince it is an open-air stadium, Bank of America Stadium has been subject to a number of events caused by extreme weather.\u000aPerhaps the most memorable weather-related game the stadium played host to wasn't forecasted in advance. During a week 3 matchup with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2011, a huge rainstorm blanketed the stadium towards the end of the second quarter. This caused excess water on the upper deck to pour onto the lower deck and subsequently onto the field, every spot resembling miniature waterfalls. The field soon became flooded. CBS cameras captured numerous images, including players, some fans (many were in the concourses) and cheerleaders braving the elements. Overall, four-plus inches of rain fell in under an hour. Charlotte Magazine later termed the game as the "[2011] Water Bowl". Carolina managed to win 16-10.\u000aIn week 16 of the 2013 season, with the Panthers playing the Saints in a game that would give the Panthers a playoff berth, heavy rain and wind hit the stadium during the second quarter. Unlike the Jacksonville game, where wind had been a non-factor, the fans stayed in their seats and the rain moved on minutes later. The Panthers eventually won 17-13.\u000aOn a Monday night game during the 2015 season, a heavy rain kept up all night, making field conditions miserable. However, the fans again braved the elements. The Panthers held on to win 29-26.\u000aIn the days leading up to the 2015 NFC Championship game, the field and sections in and around the stadium were covered in snow and an ice/sleet mixture. However, the Panthers grounds crew along with help managed to clear the field before the game. Most of the snow/sleet around and/or inside the stadium was either cleared or had melted before the game began.\u000aOn July 11, 2016 a severe storm hit the Charlotte area. Several lightning bolts struck the middle of the stadium, hitting the field. No one was injured.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Impact on NFL venues ==\u000aAt the time of its construction in the mid-1990s, the stadium was a pioneering project for the use of Personal Seat Licenses. It was the first large-scale project funded in the United States chiefly through securing PSLs, which were a new idea themselves. The strength of PSL pledges impressed NFL owners and helped result in the Carolinas receiving the first NFL expansion team in nearly two decades. The Seattle Seahawks used the stadium, among others, as a reference when designing CenturyLink Field. By 2013, the number of stadiums that had either opened or underwent renovations since Bank of America Stadium opened had risen to 25.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Stadium renovations ==\u000a\u000aDuring its first few seasons the stadium was considered so far ahead of its time that until the 2013-14 offseason, it only underwent minor improvements (aside from seating additions). The most notable of these improvements came in 2007 when the original scoreboards, video boards and displays from 1996 were replaced with 31.5' x 77' video boards and four ribbon boards: two spanning the length of the field on either side and two in opposing corners. In the following years the stadium still wasn't considered as up-to-date as other NFL stadiums. Several reasons existed, including a lack of surround sound, smaller video boards when compared with the rest of the league and poor cellular reception, among others. During the 2013 offseason, the team renovated their home locker room. It now contained 74 lockers compared to 66 previously, the interior became more clean and modern, and the team's then-new logo was added throughout.\u000aThe Panthers proposed a $250 million stadium renovation project in early 2013, pending a vote by the city of Charlotte to help pay for it. This plan included two sets of new scoreboards, multiple escalators, infrastructure and concourse improvements, among others. The subsequent vote by the city failed and efforts to get any money from the State of North Carolina failed as well. However, in April 2013 the Charlotte city council agreed to an $87.5 million deal for the renovations. This deal also keeps the Panthers in Charlotte until at least 2019. Despite the lower cost, the renovations would stay true to the team's original plans.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2014 ===\u000aIn January 2014, the Panthers began the most significant renovations to the stadium in its 18-year history as part one of a multi-year renovation plan. The upgrades, completed by the start of the 2014-2015 NFL season, included numerous enhancements. First and perhaps most striking of all, two 200' x 56' HD video boards (over twice the size of their predecessors), and two 360° ribbon boards from Daktronics replaced the previous scoreboards/ribbon boards. The new ribbon boards were the tallest in the NFL and the video boards were among the top ten largest in the NFL when installed. Secondly, escalators were installed for the upper deck, making access easier for fans. These warranted extensions to the building itself which retained the stadium's original external designs. A new surround sound system was also included, with speakers placed around the perimeter of the bowl doubling as flagpoles. In addition, four covered open-air sections on the upper deck called "fan plazas" were added. Finally, LED-enhanced glass domes were installed along with new external signage above the main entrances.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2015 ===\u000aPrior to the start of the 2015 season, the Panthers renovated all 158 existing luxury suites to the stadium and added a new private club suite, dubbed "The 32 Club" due to its position at the 32-yard line. The team later announced another new club, dubbed the "51 Club" in honor of former player and coach Sam Mills, would also be added. These new installations decreased the stadium's number of luxury suites to 153, but increased overall seating capacity. The team also added two small ribbon boards above each tunnel entrance which are visible from the stands.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2016 ===\u000aPart three of the renovations included upgrading the upper-level concourse with buffet-style drink stations and installing double the amount of wi-fi access points than before. Updated signage reflecting the team's current logos and word mark was added to the upper concourse, as well as improved concession stands and new drink concessions. Most notably, almost 100 full-body scanners replaced the traditional "pat-downs" at the main entrances and a new security office was added, as well as other security improvements.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2017 ===\u000aThe fourth and final major renovation included updating the lower-level concourse by adding new signage and seating and installing updated televisions in the club levels. Several banners depicting moments throughout Panthers history were also added to the lower concourse. The seating capacity was slightly increased thanks to upgrades at the club level. A new field and drainage system were additionally installed.\u000a\u000a\u000a== College football ==\u000a\u000aBank of America Stadium does not serve as the primary home stadium for any college football team. However, starting in 1996 the stadium has hosted many college football games.\u000aThe ACC Championship Game, played on the first Saturday in December, pits the champion of the Coastal Division against the champion of the Atlantic Division; it had been held at the stadium from 2010 to 2015. In February 2014, the ACC announced a 6-year contract extension to keep the game in Charlotte through 2019, but pulled out in September 2016 after North Carolina passed the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act (HB2). The game was reinstated after HB2's repeal in 2017.\u000aThe Belk Bowl (formerly known as the Meineke Car Care Bowl and the Continental Tire Bowl), taking place in late December; it has been held annually in Charlotte since 2002. The game pits teams from the ACC against the SEC. Charlotte-based department store Belk has been the game's sponsor since 2011 and holds sponsorship rights through 2019.\u000aThe stadium has hosted several East Carolina Pirates games: in 1996 versus the NC State Wolfpack, in 1999 versus the West Virginia Mountaineers, in 2004 versus NC State, in 2008 versus the Virginia Tech Hokies, and in 2011 versus the South Carolina Gamecocks.\u000aTwo games in the North Carolina-NC State football rivalry took place at the stadium in 1998 and 1999, respectively.\u000aOn September 3, 2015, the first Belk Kickoff Game took place at the stadium, held between the North Carolina Tar Heels and the South Carolina Gamecocks. In 2017, the Kickoff game featured NC State and South Carolina; in 2018 the game will be played between West Virginia and Tennessee.\u000aTwo more games between South Carolina and North Carolina are scheduled to be played at the stadium in 2019 and 2023.\u000aEast Carolina will play Appalachian State at the stadium in 2021, with the Mountaineers designated as the home team.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Soccer ==\u000a\u000aWith a field large enough to meet the regulatory requirements for soccer, Bank of America Stadium has been host to several soccer matches.\u000aIt was a site of the NCAA Men's Soccer Championship in 1999 and 2000.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== International soccer matches ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Concerts ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other events ==\u000aA four-day Billy Graham crusade was held there in 1996.\u000aThe closing night of the 2012 Democratic National Convention, in which President Barack Obama was expected to deliver his acceptance speech for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, was to be held at the stadium on September 6, 2012. However, due to predictions of thunderstorms, it was relocated to Spectrum Center.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aCarolina Panthers \u2013 Bank of America Stadium page\u000aBank of America Stadium at StadiumDB.com\u000aBelk Bowl official website\u000aBank of America Stadium Seating Chart

aVCoconut cream is very similar to coconut milk but contains less water. The difference is mainly consistency. It has a thicker, more paste-like consistency, while coconut milk is generally a liquid. Coconut cream is used as an ingredient in cooking, having a mild non-sweet taste. Coconut cream can be made by simmering 1 part shredded coconut with 1 part water or milk until frothy, then straining the mixture through a cheesecloth, squeezing out as much liquid as possible; this is coconut milk. The coconut milk is refrigerated and allowed to set. Coconut cream is the thick non-liquid part that separates and rises to the top of the coconut milk.\u000aCream of coconut is coconut cream that has been sweetened for use in desserts and beverages like the piña colada. Cream of coconut is also a key ingredient for a large range of desserts originated from Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia as importantly used in Polynesian Cuisine's, also.\u000aCreamed coconut is a compressed block of coconut flesh which has been slightly dehydrated and is sold in a waxy lump.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aCoconut water\u000aTender coconut\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVRichard St Lawrence, 7th Baron Howth (c.1510-1558) was an Anglo-Irish nobleman and military commander of the Tudor era.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Family ==\u000aHe was the second son of Christopher St Lawrence, 5th Baron Howth and his wife Anne Bermingham. He succeeded to the title in 1549 on the death of his brother Edward, 6th Baron Howth, who had outlived his only son. Richard married Lady Catherine FitzGerald, daughter of Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare by his second wife Elizabeth Grey, and widow of the 2nd Viscount Gormanston, but they had no children.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aWhereas his elder brother Edward is said to have left no mark on the history of his time, Richard was a political figure of considerable importance. He had some legal training, having entered Lincoln's Inn in 1541. He was a justice of the peace for Meath and Dublin, and sat on a Commission for Gaol Delivery: he was also entrusted with the levying of subsidies. He enjoyed the confidence of the English Crown and was on good terms with successive Deputies, including Sir Edward Bellingham, Sir James Croft and Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex.\u000aHe is chiefly remembered as a soldier, and he played a leading role in all the military expeditions of his time. His most famous campaign was against the Scots at Lecale in 1551. He defeated Shane O'Neill in an engagement in 1553, and saw further action in 1555. In 1556 Sussex sent him on another expedition against the Scots, whom he defeated at Glenarm. In 1558 in the absence of the Lord Deputy of Ireland he was appointed one of the guardians of the Pale, and was credited with maintaining firm order.\u000aHe died at Drogheda in the autumn of 1558, and was succeeded in the title by his brother Christopher, 8th Baron Howth.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe flora of North Korea has much in common with that of other areas of the northern hemisphere. 2898 species have been recorded, of which 14% are endemic. Four are classified as threatened.\u000aThe native plant communities in the lowlands have largely disappeared with cultivation and urbanisation, and the native conifer forest communities are located in the highlands.\u000aThe forest types are mainly subarctic (boreal) and cool-temperate forest.\u000aPinus densiflora dominates coniferous forests across North Korea, and has also increased in abundance in areas altered by human impact.\u000aThe main botanic garden in North Korea is the Central Botanical Garden, established in 1959. It is located at the base of Mount Taesong in Pyongyang.\u000aThree endangered species are so distinctive they have been classified in their own monotypic genera. The endangered Pentactina rupicola of the family Rosaceae is found only near the summit of Mount Geumgang in Kangwon Province. The only member of its genus, its relationships have been unclear, though molecular testing suggests its closest relative is the North American genus Petrophyton. Abeliophyllum distichum is a critically endangered plant from the central Korean peninsula. It too belongs to a genus of which it is the sole member. From Korea it has been introduced to horticulture in England and North America, as well as being cultivated in North Korea. Sophora koreenis was also classified in its own genus, Echinosophora but has since been found to lie within the genus Sophora genetically.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVHenry V (III) of Iron (Polish: Henryk V \u017belazny; c.\u20091319 \u2013 after 8 April 1369), was a Duke of \u017baga\u0144 since 1342, from 1349 Duke of half-G\u0142ogów, and from 1363 Duke of half-\u015acinawa.\u000aHe was the only son of Henry IV (II) the Faithful, Duke of \u017baga\u0144, by his wife Matilda, daughter of Herman, Margrave of Brandenburg-Salzwedel.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aThe young Henry V gained his political experience at the side of his father, taking part in negotiations with his Jan of \u015acinawa in 1341, who give Wschowa to them. A year later, the death of his father made Henry V the new ruler of \u017baga\u0144.\u000aHe was nicknamed "of Iron" (\u017belazny) for the consistency and ruthlessness of his acts. Immediately after he took control over the government, Henry V oriented his politics towards recovery lands that were lost during his late father's rule.\u000aIn 1343 Henry V refused to pay tribute to Bohemia and tried to recover G\u0142ogów, which was occupied by King John of Bohemia after the death of his uncle Przemko II in 1331. At the same time, King Casimir III the Great of Poland used the confusion that reigned in Silesia to take Wschowa. In the subsequent conflict, supported by his uncles Konrad I of Ole\u015bnica and Jan of \u015acinawa, Henry V forced the retreat of the Polish troops under the walls of \u015acinawa. However, thanks to the losses among Konrad I's army, the Polish King was able to retain the last Greater Poland lands which had been in the hands of Henry III's descendants.\u000aAlthough his defeat wasn't too serious, Henry V sent a message to Casimir III the Great, asking for peace. The Polish troops left \u017baga\u0144, and a meeting between the King and Henry V took place. Casimir III treated him with honors and left him all the lands who he had occupied during the conflict, except Wschowa.\u000aThe conflict with the Polish King prevented Henry V from developing a strong resistance against King John of Bohemia. An agreement was finally made on 7 June 1344, under which King John gave Henry V half of the Duchy of G\u0142ogów (however, he only could take formal possession of the land in 1349); in exchange, the Duke of \u017baga\u0144 was forced to declare himself a vassal of Bohemia and paid tribute to King John. The ceremony took place on 23 November of that year in Prague.\u000aThe events of 1344 involved Henry V in the Bohemian politics, and a year later, when war broke out between Silesia and Bohemia, the Duke of \u017baga\u0144 supported his sovereign with troops while he tried to recover Wschowa.\u000aAs a vassal of Bohemia, Henry V also participated in many ceremonies and diplomatic activities on behalf of King John and later his son and successor, Charles IV, for example in Charles's coronation on 1 September 1347 in Prague, two years later when he joined to the King's suite in a trip to Avignon and Aachen, and finally in 1355 when he travel to Italy and witnessed the King's imperial coronation in Rome.\u000aThe Duke of \u017baga\u0144's faithful service was rewarded in 1351, when, after the death of Boles\u0142aw III of P\u0142ock (Henry V's brother-in-law) without issue (and according to the 1329 treaty signed between King John of Bohemia and Duke Wenceslaus of P\u0142ock), the Emperor granted him title to this Duchy. However, the quick actions of King Casimir III the Great, who immediately after Boles\u0142aw III's death took control over P\u0142ock, prevented Henry V from obtaining this land.\u000aIn 1356, together with Nicholas the Small, Duke of Zi\u0119bice, Henry V was involved in a diplomatic mission to Constantinople, where he took part in the pilgrimage to Palestine.\u000aUpon his return Henry V extend his possessions. He purchased (mostly from Jan of \u015acinawa) the towns of Nowogród Bobrza\u0144ski, Rycze\u0144, half of \u015acinawa, and the area between the Odra River and Barycz called Mi\u0119dzyrzecze. Another success was the purchase of the half of Góra after Jan's death in 1365. Shortly after, Henry V paid the sum of 600 fine silver to his only surviving uncle, Konrad I of Ole\u015bnica, for his rights over that land.\u000aIn 1360 the relations between Henry V and Emperor Charles IV began to deteriorate. One of the reasons was that the Emperor, who decided to restitute to Przemko II's widow the other half of G\u0142ogów as her long-time waited Oprawa wdowia, but giving the promise of inheritance over Bolko II the Small, Duke of \u015awidnica. With this action, Henry V lost all his hopes of restoring the unity of G\u0142ogów. Soon, he began to visit Kraków and made an alliance with the King Casimir III the Great. In order to strengthen this bond, a political marriage was arranged between the Henry V's daughter Hedwig and King Casimir III. With this union, the Polish King increased his influence over Silesia, and the Duke of \u017baga\u0144 gained an ally and protector. The wedding took place on 25 February 1363 in Wschowa and was performed by the Bishop of Pozna\u0144, Jan V of Lutogniewo.\u000aHenry V was regarded as a good host, although he was famous for his excessive severity with his subjects. He didn't differentiate between the Church or the aristocracy when he had to distribute justice. Particularly embarrassing were his continuous disputes with the Augustinian Order of \u017baga\u0144. His rule proved too harsh in that he had to face the fury of his own vassals, who even kidnapped him, but shortly afterwards released him in the basement of St. Jakob's Church in G\u0142ogów.\u000aIn 1367 as a result of an inflammation in his eyes, Henry V became blind. He died of pneumonia two years later and was buried in the Augustinian church in \u017baga\u0144.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Marriage and issue ==\u000aBy 6 September 1337, Henry V married with Anna (b. 1324 \u2013 d. 16 February 1363), daughter of Duke Wenceslaus of P\u0142ock. They had five children:\u000aHenry VI the Older (b. bef. 1345 \u2013 d. 5 December 1393).\u000aAnna (b. bef. 1350 \u2013 d. aft. 14 July 1405), married by 20 January 1361 to Duke John I of Opava-Ratibor.\u000aHedwig (b. aft. 1350? \u2013 d. 27 March 1390), married firstly on 25 February 1363 to King Casimir III the Great of Poland and secondly by 10 February 1372 to Duke Rupert I of Legnica.\u000aHenry VII Rumpold (b. ca. 1350 \u2013 d. 24 December 1395).\u000aHenry VIII the Sparrow (b. ca. 1357 \u2013 d. 14 March 1397).\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aCawley, Charles, SILESIA, Medieval Lands database, Foundation for Medieval Genealogy ,\u000aMarek, Miroslav.

aVCarl Perkins (August 16, 1928 \u2013 March 17, 1958) was an American jazz pianist.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aPerkins was born in Indianapolis but worked mainly in Los Angeles. He is best known for his performances with the Curtis Counce Quintet, which also featured Harold Land, Jack Sheldon and drummer Frank Butler. He also performed with Tiny Bradshaw, Big Jay McNeely in 1948-49, and played dates with Miles Davis in 1950. Following a short stint in the Army (January 1951 to November 1952), he worked intermittently with the Oscar Moore Trio (1953-1955) and the Clifford Brown\u2013Max Roach group in 1954. He recorded with Frank Morgan in 1955, and with his own group in 1956. Perkins composed the standard "Grooveyard".\u000aHis playing was influenced by his polio-affected left arm, which he held parallel to the keyboard. He used his elbow to play deep bass notes. He was thus known as "the crab".\u000aHe died of a drug overdose at age 29, in Los Angeles, California. He recorded one album, Introducing Carl Perkins, and a short series of singles under his own name. Authors Paul Tanner, Maurice Gerow, and David Megill cite Perkins as one of the best "funky", or hard bop, piano players, but his early death prevented him from leaving a legacy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== As leader ===\u000aSummertime & Lullaby in Rhythm (Savoy, 1949) Single, with Edwin Perkins (b), Herb Williams (d)\u000aThe Rosary & Ave Maria (Savoy, 1949) Single, with unknown bass and drums\u000aSmoke Gets in Your Eyes & I'll Never Smile Again (Savoy, 1949) Single, with unknown bass and drums\u000aIntroducing Carl Perkins (Dootoo, 1955\u201356) Perkins's only album as leader.

aVCHEK-DT, virtual channel 6 (UHF digital channel 49), is an independent television station located in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, which serves the southwestern part of the province (including Metro Vancouver). The station is owned by the CHEK Media Group, a consortium made up of station employees and local investors. CHEK maintains studio facilities located on Kings Road in Victoria, and its transmitter is located atop Mount Warburton Pike on Saturna Island.\u000aOn cable, the station is also available on Shaw Cable channel 6 and Bell TV channel 255. On satellite, the station is available on Shaw Direct Classic tier channel 358 or Advanced tier channel 006. There is also a high definition feed available on Shaw Cable digital channel 215, and Shaw Direct Classic tier channel 005 and Advanced tier channel 505. Optik TV, IPTV channel 121 (HD), channel 9121 (SD).\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== CBC and CTV affiliation ===\u000a\u000aThe station first signed on the air on December 1, 1956. Originally operating as a CBC affiliate, it was founded by David Armstrong, owner of local radio station CKDA (1220 AM, now CJZN-FM on 91.3); Armstrong originally applied to assign the CKTV call letters for the station, which was changed to CHEK-TV prior to the station's sign-on. Its original studio facilities were located on Epsom Drive in Saanich. Initially, the radio and television stations shared staff such as Andy Steven (who was CHEK's first news director) and Kieth MacKenzie (who served as its sports director). CHEK was the only local television station that operated on Vancouver Island for many years, until CHUM Limited signed on CIVI-TV (channel 53) in October 2001. The station was the first (and is currently the oldest) privately owned television station in British Columbia. Only CBC owned-and-operated station CBUT-DT (channel 2) in Vancouver has been on the air longer, having signed on in December 1953.\u000a\u000aIn 1963, the station was purchased by businessman Frank Griffiths, who also owned Vancouver CTV affiliate CHAN-TV (channel 8, now a Global owned-and-operated station). By September of that year, CHEK's schedule consisted of some CTV programming and simulcasts of CHAN-originated shows mixed in with the CBC network schedule, along with CHEK-based local productions and syndicated programs not aired on CHAN; this setup continued into the late 1960s and early 1970s, when CHAN started to timeshift network programs. CHEK would also air CBC programs during the afternoon and primetime while running CTV shows such as University of the Air and Canada AM in the morning (simulcast with CHAN).\u000aIn 1972, CHEK, which had simulcast CHAN's News Hour since the Griffiths purchase (and would continue to do so until 2001), began producing its own news program, the Vancouver Island News Hour. It aired at 5:30 p.m. before the CHAN News Hour simulcast, and at 11:15 p.m. following CBC's The National. At one point in time, CHEK used the same Pacific dogwood logo as CHAN, but later reverted to using its own logo.\u000a\u000aBeginning around the 1978-79 television season, CHEK gradually added more CTV programs during the primetime hours (which were timeshifted from their airings on CHAN). On January 5, 1981, when CBUT launched repeater stations in Sooke and Mount McDonald, CHEK disaffiliated from CBC and became a full-time CTV station.\u000a\u000aIn 1982, Western International Communications (WIC) acquired a 59% interest in CHEK and CHAN. WIC bought the remaining 41% interest from Selkirk Communications in 1989, when that company sold most of its broadcasting assets. On January 8, 1984, CHEK moved its operations from its original studios in Saanich to its present location at 780 Kings Road, a studio facility which was originally slated to be used by a proposed CBC Television station that had been planned for the Victoria area (which ultimately never signed-on, due to lack of funding).\u000a\u000aUntil 2001, CHEK also broadcast many of the same programs as CHAN on a timeshifted basis; as with CHAN, this consisted of a mixture of CTV network programming and WIC-owned programming (usually drawn from the schedule of CHCH in Hamilton), although the WIC programming usually differed from that aired on CHAN. The launch of Baton Broadcasting-owned CIVT (channel 32) in 1997 further complicated the distribution of CTV network programming in southwestern British Columbia, with CIVT becoming the area's third station (after CHAN and CHEK) to carry CTV programming. However, after CHAN strengthened its own morning newscast around 2000, CHEK became the only station in the province that aired Canada AM, as CIVT aired its own local morning news program.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Canwest takes ownership ===\u000a\u000aCHEK came under the ownership of Canwest in 2000 after that company acquired Western International Communications. This acquisition set off a major affiliation switch among the Vancouver-Victoria market's television stations in 2001, with both CHEK and CHAN disaffiliating from CTV, and CIVT becoming the sole CTV station in British Columbia. CHAN and CHEK's affiliation agreements with CTV were originally due to end in 2000; they were extended to expire on September 1, 2001 in view of the uncertainty surrounding the local media landscape.\u000aAfter disaffiliating from CTV, CHEK became part of Canwest's new CH system. It rebranded as "CH Vancouver Island", and took on a schedule similar to that of Hamilton sister CHCH. CHEK aired 15 to 20 hours of local news programming each week, and often programs that were usually shown on CHAN were moved to accommodate its news programming. It also took the sports highlight and discussion program Sports Page from former Global owned-and-operated station CKVU (channel 10), however CHAN continued to produce the program until its cancellation in September 2005.\u000a\u000aCHEK celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2006; as part of the celebration, it aired vignettes of past station promos from the pre-CH era during commercial breaks. Another short vignette was also introduced consisting of CHEK's logos and station IDs through the years, from its original logo in 1956 to its then-current logo as "CH Vancouver Island".\u000aOn September 7, 2007, the station's newscasts were retitled CHEK News, a partial reversal of the current trend for Canadian television networks and systems to solely use their branding for their owned-and-operated stations, as a result of the rebranding of CH to E!. Programming on CHEK outside local newscasts were branded simply as "E!".\u000aOn January 3, 2009, CHEK began simulcasting CHAN's broadcast of Global National at 5:30 p.m., the first time that CHEK had simulcast its former sister station's programming since the September 2001 affiliation switch.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ownership by CHEK Media Group ===\u000aOn February 5, 2009, Canwest announced it would explore "strategic options", including a possible sale of the stations, for CHEK and its other E! owned-and-operated stations, on the basis that "a second conventional TV network [was] no longer key to the long-term success" of the company.\u000aOn July 22, 2009, after failing to find a buyer, Canwest announced it would be shutting down CHEK on August 31, 2009, issuing layoff notices to the station's staff. This would have resulted in CIVI-TV becoming the only remaining television station to serve the Victoria area. Shortly after the announcement was made, CHEK employees announced a proposal to acquire a 25% interest in the station and find local investors to acquire the remaining 75%, and organized a campaign to support the plan and save channel 6. On August 27, 2009, station employees announced that they had raised $2.5 million for the buyout plan; however, the following day, Canwest announced that the employee buyout did not meet company guidelines to keep the station on the air, and that the station had no programming and advertising lined up beyond August 31, at which date Canwest would permanently shut down the station. CHEK would have closed down following the late newscast that night, after a retrospective on the station's history.\u000aHowever, on August 31, 2009, during its 5:00 p.m. newscast, the station announced that its shutdown would be put on hold, and that it would continue broadcasting while negotiations between Canwest and the prospective new owners continued. Facing a new deadline of September 4, Canwest announced on that date that it had reached a deal to sell the station to CHEK's employees and several local investors, through a consortium known as CHEK Media Group, for $2. Canwest would continue to provide transitional support for CHEK, including providing certain programming, allowing the use of its Vancouver studios, and leasing, at "favourable rates," the 780 Kings Road studios to the new owners with the assumption of various station liabilities. The sale was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on November 9. After the sale's announcement, station manager John Pollard revealed to CBC News that CHEK would operate as an independent station (one of two such stations in Canada that began as a CBC Television affiliate, and then later a CTV affiliate, alongside CJON-DT in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador), with no plans to simulcast any American programs.\u000aCHEK Media Group took control of the station's programming on that date the station also disaffiliated from E! (which shut down a few days prior), and adopted a new schedule that included a mix of movies and older programming (both Canadian and American in origin), syndicated programming and a greater emphasis on local newscasts (including a new 10:00 p.m. newscast that debuted on September 1), and reverted to branding itself as simply "CHEK". With no plans to simulcast U.S. programming at some point, CHEK would add, in sparse amounts, additional programming during the 2009-10 season, including Let's Get It On, a mixed martial arts program; Ed the Sock's This Movie Sucks!, a movie show featuring the former MuchMusic character alongside co-host Liana Kerzner and comedian Ron Sparks; and infomercials.\u000aThe station later reversed its stance on running recent American programs; in September 2010, CHEK, for the first time since it came under the employee/investor control, began airing American network television series. Many of the programs that were added to the schedule (including Smallville, Supernatural, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Chuck and 60 Minutes) were previously carried in the Vancouver/Victoria market on CHNU-DT (channel 66) and on cable through Toronto/Hamilton independent station CKXT-TV (that station's owner, Quebecor, was in the process of replacing that station's licence with one for an all-news cable channel; Quebecor shut down the station and relinquished the CKXT license to the CRTC in 2011). The station also acquired I Hate Hollywood, produced by CHCH-DT, which picked up all of the mentioned programs.\u000aOn January 25, 2013, CHEK began sharing space with the local CBC Radio One station CBCV-FM, which migrated its operations into the television station's Kings Road studios.\u000a\u000a\u000a== News operation ==\u000aCHEK-DT presently broadcasts 12 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with two hours on weekdays and an hour on Saturdays and Sundays); in addition, the station also produces news updates between entertainment programs at the top of each hour between 1:00 and 3:30 p.m. each weekday. Unlike most news-producing television stations in major Canadian markets, the station does not broadcast a late evening newscast on weekends (its only weekend newscast is a one-hour 5:00 p.m. newscast). In addition, the station produces the half-hour public affairs program CHEK Point. CHEK-TV uses shoots on DVC-Pro tapes for all its programming and pre-recorded segments during its newscasts.\u000aLongtime news anchor Hudson Mack left CHEK in 2004, after 19 years at the station, following his appointment as news director at CIVI effective September 1 (Mack later became anchor of that station's 5:00 p.m. newscast the following month on October 11). To replace Mack, Sophie Lui returned to the station from CHAN-TV and was paired with former CIVT Victoria bureau chief Ed Watson as the station's main anchors. On August 25, 2008, production for CHEK's newscasts migrated from Victoria to CHAN's facility in Burnaby with the addition of a new virtual set, and a launch of a new newscast, CHEK News: Island 30 \u2013 which focused on news stories outside Victoria. The program was retooled months later into a newsmagazine and renamed to simply Island 30. Longtime CHAN anchor Tony Parsons joined CHEK on March 15, 2010, as anchor of CHEK's 10:00 p.m. newscast; Parsons had earlier stepped down as anchor at CHAN after a 35-year run as anchor of its News Hour supper hour broadcast on December 16, 2009.\u000aIn April 2010, CHEK entered into a news share agreement with the CBC, in which the station and CBC Television's Vancouver O&O CBUT would share news content, staff and resources. Parsons also joined the CBC to anchor CBUT's 90-minute early evening newscast, CBC News: Vancouver, resulting in him flying to Victoria after that program to anchor CHEK's 10:00 p.m. newscast. A simulcast of the 6:00 p.m. half-hour of CBC News: Vancouver was also added to CHEK's schedule on that date. On June 15, 2012, Parsons relinquished his duties on the 10:00 p.m., while remaining lead anchor of the 6:00 p.m. half-hour of the CBUT newscast; a rotation of anchors and reporters temporarily replaced Parsons as 10:00 p.m. anchor.\u000aLong time reporter Stacy Ross was named anchor of CHEK News at 5:00 and 6:30, after the resignation of Jim Beatty. In October 2015, former CTV and Global News International correspondent Ben O'Hara-Byrne joined the station, as they launched CHEK News at 6, which O'Hara-Byrne was hired to anchor the 6:00 pm and 10:00 pm news.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Notable former on-air staff ===\u000aMi-Jung Lee (now at CTV Vancouver)\u000aPamela Martin (now Director of Engagement for Premier Christy Clark & Liaison to the Leader of the British Columbia Liberal)\u000aHarvey Oberfeld (retired)\u000aTony Parsons (retired)\u000aMichaela Pereira (now at HLN as anchor of Michaela, stylized as MichaeLA; formerly with CNN as anchor for New Day)\u000aJudi Tyabji\u000aSophie Lui\u000aEd Watson\u000aHudson Mack - news anchor\u000aColeen Christie - news anchor\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Notable current on-air staff ===\u000aStacy Ross - Anchor weeknights at 5:00\u000aBen O\u2019Hara-Byrne \u2013 Anchor weeknights at 6:00\u000aEd Bain \u2013 Weather anchor at 5:00 pm 6:00 pm and 10:00 pm\u000aJeff King \u2013 Sports anchor\u000a\u000a\u000a== Programming ==\u000aAs an independent station, CHEK is programming features a mix of newscasts and other locally produced programs, syndicated programming, movies and infomercials.

Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display CHEK-DT's virtual channel as its analog-era VHF channel 6. Due to technical issues with the digital transmitter, the analogue transmitter did not shut down until October 26, 2011; it was the last television station in the Vancouver-Victoria market to continue operating its main analogue transmitter, making Calgary the largest market in Western Canada to have an analogue station operate over-the-air and also unseating Edmonton as Canada's second-largest market to have all of its stations convert to digital-only broadcasts. While all Vancouver and Victoria area television stations continued operating analogue signals until August 31, CHEK-TV was the only such station in the Vancouver/Victoria market, as all of the other transmitters in these markets shut down as required by 12:00 a.m. on September 1, 2011. KVOS-TV (channel 12) in nearby Bellingham, Washington was the first television station that served Vancouver to shut down its analogue signal on February 17, 2009.\u000aCHEK-TV was not the last analogue transmitter to shut down as part of Canada's August 31, 2011 digital conversion deadline in mandatory markets.

aVThe England national rugby union team competes in the annual Six Nations Championship with France, Ireland, Scotland, Italy, and Wales. They have won this championship outright on a total of 28 occasions (with the addition of 10 shared victories), 13 times winning the Grand Slam and 25 times winning the Triple Crown, making them the most successful team in the tournament's history. They are ranked second in the world by the International Rugby Board as of 26 June 2017. England are to date the only team from the northern hemisphere to win the Rugby World Cup, when they won the tournament back in 2003. They were also runners-up in 1991 and 2007.\u000aThe history of the team extends back to 1871 when the English rugby team played their first official Test match, losing to Scotland by one goal. England dominated the early Home Nations Championship (now the Six Nations) which started in 1883. Following the schism of rugby football in 1895 into union and league, England did not win the Championship again until 1910. England first played against New Zealand in 1905, South Africa in 1906, and Australia in 1909. England was one of the teams invited to take part in the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987 and went on to appear in the final in the second tournament in 1991, losing 12\u20136 to Australia. Following their 2003 Six Nations Championship Grand Slam, they went on to win the 2003 Rugby World Cup \u2013 defeating Australia 20\u201317 in extra time. They again contested the final in 2007, losing 15\u20136 to South Africa.\u000aEngland players traditionally wear a white shirt with a Rose embroidered on the chest, white shorts, and navy blue socks with a white trim.\u000aTheir home ground is Twickenham Stadium where they first played in 1910. The team is administered by the Rugby Football Union (RFU). Four former players have been inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame; one of these is also a member of the IRB Hall of Fame. Seven other former players are members of the IRB Hall\u2014four solely for their accomplishments as players, two solely for their achievements in other roles in the sport, and one for achievements both as a player and administrator.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aThe expansion of rugby in the first half of the 19th century was driven by ex-pupils from many of England's Public Schools, especially Rugby, who, upon finishing school, took the game with them to universities, to London, and to the counties. England's first international match was against Scotland on Monday 27 March 1871. Not only was this match England's first, but it also proved to be the first ever rugby union international. Scotland won the match by a goal and a try to a try, in front of a crowd of 4,000 people at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh. A subsequent international took place at the Oval in London on 5 February 1872 which saw England defeat Scotland by a goal, a drop goal and two tries to one drop goal. In those early days there was no points system, it was only after 1890 that a format allowing the introduction of a points system was provided. Up until 1875 international rugby matches were decided by the number of goals scored (conversions and dropped goals), but from 1876 the number of tries scored could be used to decide a match if teams were level on goals.\u000aIn 1875, England played their first game against the Irish at the Oval, winning by one goal, one drop goal and one try to nil; the match was Ireland's first ever Test. England defeated Scotland in 1880 to become the first winners of the Calcutta Cup. Their first match against Wales was played on 19 February 1881 at Richardson's Field in Blackheath. England recorded their largest victory, defeating the Welsh by seven goals, six tries, and one drop goal to nil and scoring 13 tries in the process. The subsequent meeting the following year at St Helens in Swansea was a closer contest; with England winning by two goals and four tries to nil Two years later, the first Home Nations championship was held and England emerged as the inaugural winners. In 1889, England played their first match against a non-home nations team when they defeated the New Zealand Natives by one goal and four tries to nil at Rectory Field in Blackheath. In 1890 England shared the Home Nations trophy with Scotland.\u000aEngland first played New Zealand (the All Blacks) in 1905. The All Blacks scored five tries, worth three points at this time, to win 15\u20130. The following year, they played France for the first time, and later that year they first faced South Africa (known as the Springboks); James Peters was withdrawn from the England squad after the South Africans objected to playing against a black player. The match was drawn 3\u20133. England first played France in 1905, and Australia (known as the Wallabies) in 1909 when they were defeated 9\u20133.\u000a\u000aThe year 1909 saw the opening of Twickenham as the RFU's new home, which heralded a golden era for English rugby union. England's first international at Twickenham brought them victory over Wales, and England went on to win the International Championship (then known as the Five Nations) for the first time since the great schism of 1895. Although England did not retain the title in 1911, they did share it in 1912. A Five Nations Grand Slam was then achieved in 1913 and 1914 as well as in 1921 following the First World War. England subsequently won the Grand Slam in 1924 and as well as in 1925. This was despite having started 1925 with a loss to the All Black Invincibles in front of 60,000 fans at Twickenham.\u000aAfter winning another Grand Slam in 1928, England played the Springboks in front of 70,000 spectators at Twickenham in 1931. Following the ejection of France due to professionalism in 1930, which thus reverted The Five Nations back to the Home Nations tournament, England went on to win the 1934 and 1937 Home Nations with a Triple Crown, and in 1935 achieved their first victory over the All Blacks.\u000aWhen the Five Nations resumed with the re-admission of France in 1947 after the Second World War, England shared the championship with Wales. The early Five Nations competitions of the 1950s were unsuccessful for England, winning one match in the 1950 and 1951 championships. England won the 1953 Five Nations, and followed this up with a Grand Slam in 1957, and win in 1958. England broke France's four-championship streak by winning the 1963 Championship. After this victory, England played three Tests in the Southern Hemisphere and lost all three: 21\u201311 and 9\u20136 against the All Blacks, and 18\u20139 against Australia. England did not win a single match in 1966, and managed only a draw with Ireland. They did not win another Championship that decade; a fact that prompted amateur historian F. W. P. Syms to declare this period 'the sorriest in English Rugby Union History'.\u000aDon White was appointed as England's first-ever coach in 1969. According to former Northampton player Bob Taylor, "Don was chosen because he was the most forward-thinking coach in England". His first match in charge was an 11\u20138 victory over South Africa at Twickenham in 1969. Of the eleven games England played with White in charge they won three, and drew one and lost seven. He resigned as England coach in 1971.\u000aEngland had wins against Southern Hemisphere teams in the 1970s; with victories over South Africa in 1972, New Zealand in 1973 and Australia in 1973 and 1976. The 1972 Five Nations Championship was not completed due to the Troubles in Northern Ireland when Scotland and Wales refused to play their Five Nations away fixtures in Ireland. England played in Dublin in 1973 and were given a standing ovation lasting five minutes. After losing 18\u20139 at Lansdowne Road, the England captain, John Pullin famously stated, "We might not be very good but at least we turned up."\u000aEngland started the following decade with a Grand Slam victory in the 1980 Five Nations \u2013 their first for 23 years. However in the 1983 Five Nations Championship, England failed to win a game and picked up the wooden spoon. In the first Rugby World Cup in New Zealand and Australia, England were grouped in pool A alongside Australia, Japan and the United States. England lost their first game 19\u20136 against Australia. They went on to defeat Japan and the United States, and met Wales in their quarter-final, losing the match 16\u20133.\u000aIn 1989, England won matches against Romania and Fiji, followed by victories in their first three Five Nations games of 1990. They lost to Scotland in their last game however, giving Scotland a Grand Slam. England recovered in the following year by winning their first Grand Slam since 1980. England hosted the 1991 World Cup and were in pool A, along with the All Blacks, Italy and the United States. Although they lost to the All Blacks in pool play, they qualified for a quarter-final going on to defeat France 19\u201310. England then defeated Scotland 9\u20136 to secure a place in the final against Australia which they lost 12\u20136.\u000aThe next year, England completed another Grand Slam and did not lose that year, including a victory over the Springboks. In the lead up to the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, England completed another Grand Slam \u2013 their third in five years. In the World Cup, England defeated Argentina, Italy and Samoa in pool play and then defeated Australia 25\u201322 in their quarter-final. England's semi-final was dominated by the All Blacks and featured four tries, now worth five points each, by Jonah Lomu; England lost 45\u201329. They then lost the third/fourth place play-off match against France.\u000aIn 1997, Clive Woodward became England's coach. That year, England drew with New Zealand at Twickenham after being heavily defeated in Manchester the week before. England toured Australia, New Zealand and South Africa in 1998. Many of the England team made themselves unavailable for the tour nicknamed the "tour from hell" where England were beaten 76\u20130 by the Wallabies. In 1999 during the last ever Five Nations match, Scott Gibbs sliced through six English tackles to score in the last minute, and the last ever Five Nations title went to Scotland.\u000a\u000aEngland commenced the new decade by winning the inaugural Six Nations title. In 2001, Ireland defeated England 20\u201314 in a postponed match at Lansdowne Road to deny them a Grand Slam. Although the 2002 Six Nations Championship title was won by France, England had the consolation of winning the Triple Crown. In 2002, England defeated Argentina in Buenos Aires, and then a second string All Blacks, Australia, and South Africa at Twickenham. In 2003, England won the Grand Slam for the first time since 1995, followed by wins over Australia and the All Blacks on their Summer tour in June.\u000aGoing into the 2003 World Cup, England were one of the tournament favourites. They reached the final on 22 November 2003 against host Australia and became world champions after a match-winning drop goal by star flyhalf Jonny Wilkinson deep into extra time that made the final score 20\u201317. Not only was it their first Rugby World Cup victory, but it was the country's first World Cup since winning the 1966 FIFA (football) World Cup as hosts. On 8 December, the English team greeted 750,000 supporters on their victory parade through London before meeting Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.\u000a\u000aIn the 2004 Six Nations Championship, England lost to both France and Ireland and finished third. Sir Clive Woodward resigned on 2 September and Andy Robinson was appointed England head coach. Robinson's first Six Nations campaign in 2005 resulted in fourth place for England, and although they then defeated Australia 26\u201316, the year was completed with a 23\u201319 loss to the All Blacks.\u000aFollowing their loss to South Africa in the 2006 end of year Tests, England had lost eight of their last nine Tests \u2013 their worst ever losing streak. Coach Andy Robinson resigned after this run, and attack coach Brian Ashton was appointed head coach in December 2006. England started the 2007 Six Nations Championship with a Calcutta Cup victory over Scotland. The championship also included a historic match at Croke Park against Ireland which England lost 43\u201313, their heaviest ever defeat to Ireland.\u000aIn the 2007 World Cup England played in Pool A with Samoa, Tonga, South Africa and the United States. They qualified for the quarter finals after losing embarrassingly to South Africa 36\u20130 where they defeated Australia 12\u201310, and then faced hosts France in their semi-final. England won 14\u20139 to qualify for the final against South Africa, which they lost 15\u20136. England followed up the World Cup with two consecutive 2nd place finishes in the Six Nations, behind Wales and Ireland respectively. The 2009 Six Nations also saw former England Captain Martin Johnson take up the job of head coach. However, Johnson could not replicate his on-field success to management, and resigned in November 2011 following a miserable 2011 Rugby World Cup which ended in quarter-final defeat by France and featured a series of on and off-field controversies.\u000aOn 29 March 2012, Stuart Lancaster, the former Elite Rugby Director at Leeds Carnegie was appointed England head coach by the Rugby Football Union. Previously Lancaster was appointed as the head coach on a short term basis assisted by existing forwards coach Graham Rowntree and Andy Farrell.\u000aLancaster was considered a success in his first campaign as England coach - during the 2012 Six Nations Championship, defending Champions England finished in second place after losing 19\u201312 to Wales at Twickenham Stadium, but successfully defended the Calcutta Cup beating Scotland 13\u20136 at Murrayfield. England finished the year on a high, after outplaying World Cup holders New Zealand in November, in which England dominated to win 38\u201321. The All Blacks had been unbeaten in 20 matches but were completely outplayed by England.\u000aDuring the 2013 Six Nations Championship again England finished in second place behind Wales after losing the opportunity of being Grand Slam winners for the first time since 2003, by losing to Wales in Cardiff 30\u20133. It was also the first time every team managed to win at least 3 competition points (the equivalent of a win and a draw or three draws) since 1974. However, England did again defeat Scotland for the Calcutta Cup 38\u201318 at Twickenham.\u000aDuring the 2013 summer tour to South America in which Lancaster took an experimental side, England beat a South American select XV before a 2\u20130 series victory over Argentina, a first away series win against The Pumas for 32 years. England hosted the 2015 Rugby World Cup but were eliminated in the Pool stage, the first hosts in a Rugby World Cup to have failed to qualify for the knockout stages.\u000aHowever, despite the 2015 World Cup setback following the appointment of new head coach Eddie Jones, England won the Grand Slam in the 2016 Six Nations Championship, went the whole of 2016 unbeaten, including winning a series whitewash over Australia in Sydney, and equalled the world record of 18 consecutive wins with an impressive 61\u201321 victory over Scotland securing the six nations championship of the 2017 edition.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Twickenham ==\u000a\u000aUp until 1910, the English rugby team used various stadia in a number of venues around England before settling at Twickenham Stadium. It is the largest rugby-dedicated stadium in the world. After sell-out matches at Crystal Palace in 1905 and 1906 against New Zealand and South Africa respectively, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) decided to invest in their own ground. In 1906, the RFU arranged for William Williams to find a home ground for English Rugby. The land for the ground was purchased the following year for £5,572 12s and 6d, and construction began the following year.\u000aThe first England match was held on 9 October 1910 between England and Wales. England ran out winners, 11\u20136, beating Wales for the first time since 1898. The stadium was expanded in 1927 and again in 1932. Further upgrades did not happen until the 1990s when new North, East and West stands were built. A new South stand was built in 2005 and 2006 to make the stadium into a complete bowl. The first match to be played at the redeveloped Twickenham was on Sunday 5 November 2006 against the All Blacks. England lost the match 41-20 in front of a record crowd of 82,076.\u000aAlthough England have played home matches almost exclusively at Twickenham since 1910, they have played at Huddersfield's Galpharm Stadium twice in 1998, at Old Trafford against New Zealand in 1997 and at Wembley Stadium against Canada in 1992. They also played the first of a two-test series against Argentina at Old Trafford in June 2009, a match originally scheduled to be held in Argentina but moved by the country's national federation for financial reasons.\u000aThe pitch at Twickenham was replaced by a hybrid 'Desso' type, in June 2012, which uses artificial fibres entwined with real grass. This makes it a lot harder wearing in wet conditions.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Swing Low, Sweet Chariot ===\u000a\u000a"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" is very commonly sung at England fixtures \u2013 especially at Twickenham. The song arrived in the rugby canon through the Welsh male voice choirs who sang many spirituals. It was a popular rugby song at clubs during the 1950s and 1960s and was sung every year at Twickenham during the end-of-season all-day Middlesex Sevens tournament accompanied by risqué hand gestures that played on the double entendres of some of the words. During the 1970s the Twickenham crowd also sang it during England matches then coming into the last match of the 1988 season, against the Irish, England had lost 15 of their previous 23 matches in the Five Nations Championship. The Twickenham crowd had only seen one solitary England try in the previous two years and at half time against Ireland they were 3\u20130 down. During the second half a remarkable transformation took place and England started playing an expansive game many had doubted they were capable of producing. A 3\u20130 deficit was turned into a 35\u20133 win, with England scoring six tries.\u000aIn the 35\u20133 win, three of England's tries were scored by Chris Oti, a player who had made a reputation for himself that season as a speedster on the left wing. A group of boys from the Benedictine school Douai following a tradition at their school games sang the song on his final try, and other spectators around the ground joined in. Since then "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" became a song to sing at England home games, in the same way that "The Fields of Athenry" is sung in Dublin and "Cwm Rhondda" is sung at Cardiff. It has since become the anthem of the team as in 1991 the result of a plan of the then RFU marketing director Mike Coley for the team to launch a song leading up to that year's Rugby World Cup. He had wanted to use Jerusalem but it was used in the Rugby League cup final that year so the song was changed at short notice to "Swing Low". There were a number of versions recorded including a 'rap' version with Jerry Guscott doing a solo. Needless to say that was never released but the version released did reach the top 40 in the UK singles chart during the competition and was then adopted as the England rugby song.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Strip ==\u000a\u000aEngland have typically worn all-white shirts, white shorts with navy and white socks. The emblem on the shirts is a red rose, rather than the Plantagenet Three Lions displayed on the shirts of the England football and cricket teams. The strip is manufactured by Canterbury and O2 is the shirt sponsor. The change strip is normally red, although prior to the introduction of the red strip, navy blue was used and was reintroduced for the 2016-17 season. Purple was used as the change strip as of the 2009 autumn internationals, reflecting the traditional colour of the original England track-suits from the 1960s, 70s and 80s. For the 2011 Rugby World Cup the change kit was black.\u000aThe Rugby Football Union (RFU) had created the national side's emblem prior to an English team being sent to Edinburgh to play a Scottish side. A red rose was chosen to be the side's emblem. The white kit worn by the national team was taken from the kit used at Rugby School. Alfred Wright, an employee of the Rugby Football Union, is credited with the standardisation and new design of the rose, which up until 1920 had undergone many variations in its depiction. The Wright design is thought to have been used without minor alteration until the late 1990s. It was not until 1997 that the rose was modernised when Nike became the official strip supplier.\u000aIn 2003 England first used a skin-tight strip. This was intended to make it more difficult for the opposition to grasp the shirt when tackling. The home and away strips for 2007 were unveiled on 15 May that year. The materials used are superior, offering improved performance to the 2003 kit. However, a sweeping red mark on the base-white front which forms St George's Cross on the top left, and a changed away-strip (dark blue to red), have received criticism because it is felt that emphasis has been placed on St George's Cross at the expense of the traditional red rose. The new strip was introduced in England's home game against Wales on 4 August, while the alternative strip was first used against France on 18 August.\u000aThe former England home strip was white with a strip of red around the neck, and the away strip was black (causing much controversy due to the famous All-Black kit of New Zealand), both kits had a ground breaking new technology in the form of a gripper print. A special strip was worn during the match versus Wales in the 2010 Six Nations Championship which replicated that worn in 1910 to celebrate the 100-year anniversary of Twickenham. The current, 2016-17, England strip is made by Canterbury. It features plain white shorts and a plain white shirt featuring an embossed St. George's Cross pattern on the chest and upper back. The crest is 3D injection moulded on a raised pouch, and a new redesigned deconstructed neckline. The current alternative kit is dark sapphire and features the same embossed St. George's Cross but in red, Shorts are also dark sapphire. Home socks are midnight blue with a white top and this is reversed for the alternative socks. In 2013-14, the strip featured plain white shorts and a plain white shirt, but with an added black stripe on each sleeve. The alternative kit had a red and white striped shirt, with blue shorts.In 2014/15, the home shirt was white, with a "V-Neck" around the collar. The kit also had little Victoria Crosses on the main chest. It also had the O2 sponsorship marking on the chest. The shorts were plain white with the sponsorship marking on them. The socks were dark blue and had a white stripe at the top. The alternate shirt was exactly the same but was red instead of white. The shorts were navy blue and the socks were red with a white stripe on top. The 2015/16 strip was similar but didn't have the small crosses on the shirt. The Canterbury logo was straight and not diagonal it had white lines going horizontally across the chest. For the 2015 Rugby World Cup, the kit remained the same just with the Rugby World Cup logo on the right and no O2 logo in the centre. For the home strip, the shorts and socks remained the same. The away 2015/16 strip and World Cup strip was red, with dark red and maroon sleeves. The shorts were maroon and the socks were red with a maroon stripe on top.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Record ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Six Nations ===\u000aEngland competes annually in the Six Nations Championship, which is played against five other European nations: France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, and Wales. The Six Nations started out as the Home Nations Championship in 1883 which England won with a Triple Crown. England have won the title outright 28 times (a record for the tournament) and shared victory ten times. Their longest wait between championships was 18 years (1892\u20131910). During the Six Nations, England also contests the Calcutta Cup with Scotland (which England first won in 1880) and the Millennium Trophy with Ireland (which England first won in 1988). The matches between England and France are traditionally known as "Le Crunch".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== World Cup ===\u000a\u000aEngland have contested every Rugby World Cup since it began in 1987, reaching the final three times and winning in 2003.\u000aIn the inaugural tournament they finished second in their pool before losing to Wales in the quarter-finals. They again finished pool runners-up in 1991 but recovered to beat France in their quarter-final, and then Scotland in their semi-final, en route to a 12\u20136 final defeat to Australia.\u000aIn 1995, England topped their pool and defeated Australia 25\u201322 at the quarter-final stage before being beaten by the All Blacks in the semi-final. Their third-fourth place play-off match against France was lost 19\u20139.\u000aThe 1999 competition saw England again finish second in the pool stage. Though they proceeded to win a play-off game against Fiji, they went out of the tournament in the quarter-finals, losing 44\u201321 to South Africa.\u000aIn the 2003 tournament, England came top of their pool. They progressed to the final beating Wales and France in the quarter and semi-finals. England won the final with a drop goal in the last minute of extra time.\u000aThe 2007 defence of the cup in France got off to a very poor start, with a below par victory over the United States and a heavy 36\u20130 defeat to South Africa leaving the holders on the brink of elimination at the group stage. Improved performances against Samoa and Tonga saw England again reach the knockout stages as pool runners-up, before a surprise 12\u201310 defeat of Australia in Marseille and a narrow 14\u20139 victory over the host nation France carried England to a second successive final appearance. The final was played in Paris on 20 October against South Africa, who won by 15 points to 6.\u000aIn 2011, England reached the quarter final stage, losing 19\u201312 to France.\u000aIn 2015, England became the first sole host nation to fail to qualify for the knockout stage, exiting the pool stage after losses to Wales and Australia.\u000aEngland's Jonny Wilkinson is the highest points scorer in the rugby world cup, having scored 277 points between 1999 and 2011. England have the fourth most points and fourth most tries scored in the World Cup.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Overall ===\u000aWhen the World Rankings were introduced in October 2003, England was ranked 1st. They briefly fell to 2nd in September that year before regaining 1st place. They fell to 2nd, and then to 3rd in June 2004. After the 2005 Six Nations they fell to 6th where they remained until they moved into 5th in December that year. In 2006, their ranking again fell and they finished the year ranked 7th. 2007 saw them bounce back to 3rd after their good run in that year's World Cup, where they finished runners-up. In 2008, their rankings slipped so that during the 2009 Six Nations Championship they dropped to their lowest ranking of 8th. They again were 8th during the autumn internationals of the same year. After a resurgence which saw them rise to a ranking of 4th in the world, the team again slipped, following a poor showing at the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and was ranked 6th in February 2012. England entered the 2015 Rugby World Cup ranked 4th. However, after failing to exit the pool stage, England were ranked 8th in the world as of 1 November 2015.\u000aEngland has won 396 of their 717 Test matches, a winning record of 55.38%. Below is a summary table of capped England matches up until 10 February 2018. Only fixtures recognised as test matches by the RFU are included.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Players ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Current squad ===\u000aOn 18 January, England named a 35-man squad ahead of their opening 2018 Six Nations Championship match, against Italy.\u000aNote:The number of caps was updated 10 February 2018\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Notable players ===\u000a\u000aFour former England representatives have been inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame: Bill Beaumont, Martin Johnson, Jason Leonard and Wavell Wakefield.\u000aSeven former England internationals are also members of the IRB Hall of Fame. Four of them\u2014Johnson, Alan Rotherham, Harry Vassall and Robert Seddon\u2014were inducted for their accomplishments as players. Two other former England players, John Kendall-Carpenter and Clive Woodward, were inducted into the IRB Hall for non-playing accomplishments in the sport. Another former England player, Alfred St. George Hamersley, was inducted for achievements as both a player and a rugby administrator.\u000aWavell Wakefield represented England in 31 Tests between 1920 and 1927, including 13 Tests as captain. He was involved in three Five Nations Grand Slams in 1921, 1923 and 1924. Playing as flanker, Wakefield introduced new elements to back row tactics which beforehand concentrated on the set piece. He became a Member of Parliament in 1935, and was knighted in 1944. He became the RFU President in 1950 and following his retirement from politics was awarded the title the first Baron Wakefield of Kendal.\u000aBetween 1975 and 1982, Bill Beaumont represented England in 34 Tests. Playing at lock, he was captain between 1978 and 1982 in 21 Tests including the 1980 Grand Slam \u2013 England's first since 1957. Later that year, he captained the British Lions to South Africa \u2013 the first time an Englishman had captained the Lions since 1930. Furthermore, Beaumont represented the Barbarians FC on fifteen occasions.\u000aThe youngest ever England captain at 22, Will Carling represented England in 72 Tests, and as captain 59 times between 1988 and 1996. He was best known as a superlative leader, motivating England to a remarkable three Grand Slams in five years, including back to back slams in 1991 and 1992. He also led England to the final of the 1991 World Cup, and captained the Barbarians FC. His playing talents were not as flamboyant as some of his colleagues, but his effectiveness cemented him as a first choice at centre. It is possible he would already be in the Hall of Fame were it not for outspoken tendencies with respect to the English RFU committee ("Old Farts"), who may as a result be reluctant to acknowledge his achievements. He was made an OBE in 1991.\u000aDescribed as arguably "the greatest forward" to play for England, Martin Johnson played 84 Tests for England, and 8 Tests for the British and Irish Lions. He first represented England in 1993, and later that year the Lions. He captained the Lions to South Africa in 1997, and in 1999 was appointed captain of England. He became England's most successful ever captain. He became the first player to captain two Lions tours when he captained them in Australia in 2001. He retired from Test rugby after he led England to a Six Nations Grand Slam and World Cup victory in 2003 and has since become the team Manager. At the 2011 IRB Awards ceremony in Auckland on 24 October 2011, the night after the World Cup Final, Johnson was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame alongside all other World Cup-winning captains from 1987 through 2007 (minus the previously inducted Australian John Eales).\u000aJason Leonard, also known as "The Fun Bus", appeared 114 times for England at prop, which was the world record for international appearances for a national team until 2005, when it was surpassed by Australia's scrum-half George Gregan. He was on the England team that finished runners up to Australia in the 1991 Rugby World Cup final, but avenged this twelve years later, coming on as a substitute for Phil Vickery in England's victorious 2003 Rugby World Cup final appearance. He also went on three British and Irish Lions tours where he was capped five times.\u000aAlan Rotherham and Harry Vassall, both 19th-century greats for Oxford and England, were inducted into the IRB Hall in April 2011. The IRB recognised them for "their unique contribution to the way that Rugby was played", specifically stating that they "are credited with pioneering the passing game and the three-man backline, which became widespread during the 1880s."\u000aTwo other England internationals, John Kendall-Carpenter and Clive Woodward, were inducted into the IRB Hall alongside Johnson at the 2011 IRB Awards. Although both had notable careers for England, they were recognised for accomplishments in other roles in the sport. Kendall-Carpenter was cited as one of four key figures in the creation of the Rugby World Cup, whilst Woodward was inducted as coach of the 2003 World Cup winners, alongside all other World Cup-winning coaches from 1987 to 2007.\u000aEngland's most recent inductees into the IRB Hall are 19th-century internationals Alfred St. George Hamersley and Robert Seddon, both inducted in 2013. Hamersley played for England in the first-ever rugby union international against Scotland in 1871, and captained England in the last of his four appearances in 1874. He went on to play significant roles in the early development of the sport in both New Zealand and Canada. Seddon, capped three times for England in 1887, was most notable as the captain of the unofficial British side that toured Australia and New Zealand in 1888; he died in a boating accident during the tour. This venture proved to be the genesis of the modern British and Irish Lions. The touring team was also inducted alongside Seddon.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Individual records ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Most capped players ===\u000aUpdated 12 February 2018\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Top point scorers ===\u000aUpdated 12 February 2018\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Top try scorers ===\u000aUpdated 28 June 2017\u000a\u000a\u000a== Training ==\u000aPennyhill Park Hotel in Bagshot, Surrey, is the chosen training base for the team in the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Loughborough University, Bisham Abbey and the University of Bath grounds served as training bases prior to this agreement. Martin Johnson noted the hotel's facilities and its proximity to Twickenham and Heathrow as deciding factors in this decision. The team had their own pitchside gym and fitness rooms constructed on the hotel premises at the start of the long-term arrangement. Since its completion in 2010 the team also regularly use Surrey Sports Park at the University of Surrey in nearby Guildford for much of their training.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Club versus country ===\u000a\u000aAlthough the England team is governed by the Rugby Football Union (RFU), players have been contracted to their clubs since the advent of professionalism in late 1995. Since then, players have often been caught in a "power struggle" between their clubs and the RFU; this is commonly referred to as a "club versus country" conflict. The first major dispute between England's top clubs (who play in the English Premiership) and the RFU occurred in 1998, when some of the clubs refused to release players to tour Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The tour became known as the "Tour from hell" after an England squad of second-string players were defeated in all four Tests, including a 76\u20130 defeat by Australia. The clubs also withdrew from the 1998/99 European Cup.\u000aIn 2001, the top clubs and the RFU formed "England Rugby" to help govern the club and international game. The parties agreed to restrict the number of matches at club and international level that elite players (a group of 50 or 60 players selected by the RFU) could play in order to reduce player burnout and injuries. In return for releasing players from club commitments, the clubs were to receive compensation from the RFU. This agreement was considered central to the England victory in the 2003 World Cup. Clive Woodward, England coach from November 1997, resigned in 2004 because he was unable to get the access to the players that he wanted; "I wanted more from the union \u2013 more training days with the players, more influence over the way they were treated \u2013 and ended up with less." Andy Robinson, Woodward's successor, blamed the lack of control over players for his team's unsuccessful record. Brian Ashton, who took over from Robinson, intentionally named his playing squad for Six Nations matches in 2007 early in the hope that their clubs would not play them in the weekend prior to a Test. The RFU and the Premiership clubs are negotiating a similar deal to the one in 2001 that will enable international players to be released into the England squad prior to international matches.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Coaches ===\u000aThe following is a list of all England coaches. The first appointed coach was Don White in 1969. The most recent coach is Eddie Jones. He took over from Stuart Lancaster a week after Lancaster's resignation. Jones became the first foreigner to coach the English side.\u000aUpdated 10 February 2018\u000aBetween September 2015 and March 2017 England won a top tier nation record equalling 18 test matches in a row, 17 of which were under Eddie Jones.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Media coverage ==\u000aEngland's mid-year tests and end of year tests are televised live by Sky Sports. Highlights of the end of year tests are broadcast by the BBC. All Six Nations games are broadcast free-to-air on the BBC and ITV since 2016.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aEngland national under-20 rugby union team\u000aEngland national rugby sevens team\u000aEngland Saxons\u000aEngland women's national rugby union team\u000aRugby union in England\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000aBowker, Barry (1978).

aV"Brian Does Hollywood" is the second episode of the third season of the animated comedy series Family Guy. This is the 2nd episode that was originally produced for season 2. It originally aired as a second part to an episode called "The Thin White Line" on Fox in the United States on July 18, 2001. The episode features Brian as he attempts to make it in show business as a screenwriter once he moves to Hollywood. Brian soon discovers, however, that it is much harder than he thinks, and ultimately settles on directing porn films.\u000aThe episode was written by Gary Janetti and directed by Gavin Dell. The episode featured guest performances by Gary Cole, Louise DuArt, Olivia Hack, Jenna Jameson, Ron Jeremy, and Ray Liotta, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot summary ==\u000aAfter completing drug rehab and leaving Quahog, a purpose-seeking Brian moves to Los Angeles, California to live with his cousin Jasper in hopes of fulfilling his ambition to become a screenwriter. However, he struggles to find a producer willing to purchase his scripts and to make ends meet he takes menial jobs including waiting on guests at elite Hollywood parties and washing cars. He initially lies about his success to his family. Brian gets a break when Jasper connects him with an independent film producer who offers a director role; however, Brian soon discovers that the offer more specifically is the directing of pornographic films. Although he is initially hesitant, Brian accepts the offer.\u000aMeanwhile, the Griffins have Stewie audition for Kids Say the Darndest Things to gain a free trip to Los Angeles in order to see Brian (although Stewie has the motive of using this opportunity to unleash a mass hypnosis device on national television, a plot which inevitably fails). Stewie makes the audition and the family travels to Los Angeles where they meet Brian for lunch. Brian, who now has a job as a director, offers to invite them to watch him direct on the film set (though at the time he is unaware of adult genre involved).\u000aLater, when the family tries to visit Brian's set, a shamed and startled Brian has security remove them from the set before they find out his secret. Shortly afterwards, he learns from his cousin Jasper that he has received a directing nomination at the Woody Awards (a fictional film awards ceremony for adult films). Brian goes to the ceremony and is met at the bar by Lois and Peter, who explain that Jasper had told them the truth about Brian's job and that they support him. Brian finally has an epiphany and sees that it was his family that fulfilled his life (just in time to win his nomination). At the end of the episode, Brian returns home with his family on a transcontinental flight back to Rhode Island.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production ==\u000a\u000aThe episode was written by series regular Gary Janetti, and directed by Gavin Dell.

aVOur Sister Killjoy: or Reflections from a Black-eyed Squint is the debut novel of Ghanaian author Ama Ata Aidoo, first published by Longman in 1977. It has been called "a witty, experimental work whose main point is a stylish dismissal of characteristic attitudes of both the white world and the black middle class." It was described by one reviewer as "a strikingly unusual and pertinent commentary on the African encounter with the West, on European soil.... Without being a conventional narrative or biography, it is a text that uses the framework of an account of a state-sponsored visit to Germany by a young Ghanaian woman (the 'Sister' of the title, usually addressed as 'Sissie') to analyse what Europe is and does to those Africans whom it 'sponsors' and educates."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Summary ==\u000aOur Sister Killjoy is about a young African woman named Sissie who goes to Europe to "better" herself (with European education) as described by her African counterparts. The novel revolves around themes of black diaspora and colonialism, in particular colonization of the mind. Sissie observes the other Africans who have emigrated (also for education and the desire for a better life in Europe) and sees them as "sell-outs" who have forgotten their culture and their motherland. Aidoo touches on the effects of post-colonialism and how the traditions and thoughts of the colonizer are instilled into the minds of the colonized. Sissie in the novel represents the need to have a connection to one's past.\u000aAidoo is critical of Africans' adulation of Europeans. The first thing Sissie notices upon going into the town in Germany are shiny and glittery material possessions. Aidoo critiques the way some Africans buy into the notion of white superiority, by turning to Europe when they are looking for the "best," whether in education or material possessions. The orientation toward Europe and the investment in whiteness begins in Africa and continues and is reinforced when Africans migrate to Europe. After colonialism, places such as Ghana and Nigeria are left with European institutions and frameworks and they continue to operate within them post-independence. Aidoo positions "Our Sister" as a radical to stand in strong opposition to those black people whose minds do not seem to be filled with thoughts of their own, such as Sammy, the first black person we are introduced to other than Our Sister.\u000aWhile in Germany Sissie befriends Marija. Although speaking different languages, they build a strong understanding. As Sissie's time in Germany nears an end, Marija makes a pass at her. Sissie has mixed emotions, never having been attracted to a woman before, and it makes her think deeply on same-gendered relationships. Later in the novel, Sissie goes to England and is surprised at the number of Africans she sees. She is shocked at their "wretched living conditions"; they live in basement flats and wear ugly, worn-in clothing. Sissie is shocked at the women who, had they been in Africa, would have worn the most beautiful, luxurious clothing, and have now ruined their own beauty. Sissie describes their position in England as "running very fast just to remain where they are".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Themes ==\u000aSexuality - Sissie explores her sexuality by kissing Marija while in Marija\u2019s home on one of her last nights in Germany. She often thinks about if she was the opposite gender her and Marija could be together.\u000aNationalism - Sissie isn\u2019t pleased with European civilization, she prefers to live the way she lived in Ghana. She thinks European culture is strange compared to her own. She complains about the food, weather, clothing etc.\u000aUnaccustomed \u2013 Sissie got an scholarship to study abroad in Germany, she got her Visa within weeks, 3 months before she was supposed to leave so she wasn\u2019t as culturally prepared for Europe as she would have been if she waited the 3 months to go. She complains about the food stating that Europeans prefer their food ice cold, whereas in Ghana everybody prefers hot foods.\u000aLove \u2013 Sissie clearly has a deep love for her home country, she doesn\u2019t understand why people get an education abroad and don\u2019t return home to better their countries. In the novel, she tries to convince two other Ghanaian students to return home like she is but they seem to already be accustomed by European lifestyles.\u000a Guilt- The international students, going home to Africa and telling their peers of their travels to Europe lying that Europe is such a great place, but in reality, it is much different from Africa and would be a complete culture shock for anybody.\u000aBrain-drain -- Sissie believes that Ghana will become a brain drain country if the citizens that are going abroad to get a better education don't return home to Ghana because there will be a shortage of in demand professions such as doctors, teachers, engineers, etc.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Structure ==\u000aThe book is split into three different sections and, in its form, the novel switches between two voices: verse and prose. Some portions of the book are structured as poetic verse. These sections sometimes suddenly interrupt the prose sections; in one way, this draws out the plot more slowly, but it also allows the reader to gain a sense of Sissie's inner thoughts and the main themes of the book. The verses tend to have an angry tone, are more retrospective, and generally serve to fill in the gaps and comment on the themes of colonialism and diaspora. The parts to the book that are in prose are used in a more standard way to give basic information about the characters and the plot. Switching unexpectedly between the two voices also creates a sense of tension that reflects the tension Sissie feels during her time in Europe.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aMegan Behrent, "Ama Ata Aidoo: Our Sister Killjoy"; "Our Sister Killjoy: Characterizing Immigration/Emigration"; "Our Sister Killjoy: Critiquing Nationalism": "Aidoo: The 'been-to' in Our Sister Killjoy", African Postcolonial Literature in English, Brown University, 1997.\u000aGay Wilentz (1991), "The Politics of Exile: Ama Ata Aidoo's Our Sister Killjoy", Studies in 20th Century Literature, Vol. 15: Iss. 1, Article 12. doi:10.4148/2334-4415.1271.\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a"Our Sister Killjoy" at The Complete Review.

aVSea of Souls is a BBC paranormal drama series, recounting the fictional activities of a group of investigators into psychic and other paranormal events. Produced in-house by BBC Scotland, initially in association with Sony Pictures Television International, the series debuted on BBC One in the UK in February 2004. A second series was shown from January 2005, with a third following in 2006 and then a fourth in April 2007.\u000aThe programme was created by writer David Kane, who also wrote the entire first series. The final series, unlike the previous series, was an independent production for BBC Scotland by Carnival Films.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Overview ==\u000aThe central character is Dr. Douglas Monaghan, played by Bill Paterson, who is the head of a parapsychology unit at a fictional university in Glasgow, Scotland. In the first series he is assisted by Megan Sharma (Archie Panjabi) and Dr. Andrew Gemmill (Peter McDonald), but these characters were replaced \u2013 without any on-screen explanation \u2013 in the second series by Justine McManus (Dawn Steele) and Craig Stevenson (Iain Robertson).\u000aThe series has seen the team encounter phenomena such as ghosts, reincarnation and voodooism. Each series has consisted of six one-hour episodes, initially comprising three two-part story lines. The first series was shown on consecutive Monday and Tuesday nights, but for series two the transmission days switched to Saturday and Sunday. Other changes introduced in the second series included the introduction of sub-plots to help with the pacing of each storyline, and more Scottish-focused story lines, the first series having been criticised for the characters' frequent trips to London.\u000aThe third series was broadcast from 7 January \u2013 11 February 2006, each episode airing in a 9.10pm-10.10pm slot. For this third run the format had been changed \u2014 the series now consisted of six individual one-episode stories instead of three two-parters, with the episodes being shown once per week on Saturday nights. Executive producer and BBC Scotland Head of Drama Barbara McKissack explained the change in format as being "a much better, faster paced format for this kind of show." \u000aProminent guest stars in individual story lines have included Peter Capaldi, Siobhan Redmond, James Fleet, John Guerrasio, Paul McGann, John Hannah, Jeff Rawle and Colin Salmon. The first two series have been released on DVD in the UK. The programme has also been shown overseas, including in Australia on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which showed the first series from September 2005, with series two being shown on Sci Fi in January 2007. It has also been broadcast to South America by HBO Latin America in 2006. In total, the series has been sold to over forty countries as of December 2005.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production ==\u000aThe first series was produced by Phil Collinson, but after he left to produce the revival of Doctor Who, Stephen Garwood took over as producer for the second and third series.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Awards ==\u000aAt the BAFTA Scotland Awards, held on 13 November 2005 at the Radisson SAS Hotel, Sea of Souls won Best Drama, beating Taggart and Monarch of the Glen.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cast ==\u000aDr Douglas Monaghan - Bill Paterson\u000aIs the main character over all and has featured in all series so far, though he featured much more predominantly in series one and two. He is dependable and compassionate, and has changed throughout the run of the series. At the beginning Douglas was a sceptic, almost refusing to believe and denying anything paranormal. But as of series three he has become more open to the suggestion that not everything can be easily explained by science.\u000aJustine McManus - Dawn Steele\u000aAfter arriving in series two she struggled to gain the respect of co-workers, but one year on is much more self-assured and is enjoying her new-found friendship with Craig. She is a single mother of her 10-year-old son Billy. We have not been introduced to his father, yet he does often look after Billy. She is empathic and considerate and has a knack with people. Right from the beginning it is clear that Justine has several paranormal abilities, she can apparently see the future (which featured in series three episode Oracle), sense things and see the dead. But none of these have been properly looked into as Justine is unsure of finding out the true nature of them. In series three her abilities are shown to be much more powerful than she could ever have imagined, especially when it seems she has passed them on to her son Billy.\u000aCraig Stevenson - Iain Robertson\u000aAlso arrived in series two, Craig is often insensitive and arrogant towards people who seek the department's help, it's clear he's not a people person and he is quick to rush into things. In series three, a new friendship with Justine seems to have done him good. He also loses some of his know-it-all side. Craig's new friendship with Justine also leads to him discover her hidden psychic skills, and it's a revelation that has far-reaching implications for him. In the third series his own beliefs are put to the test, causing him to reconsider his mindset towards the paranormal.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Locations ==\u000aThe fictional "Clyde University" in the series is in real life Glasgow's University of Strathclyde, whose campus is a principal filming location, particularly during the second and third series.\u000aThe home of the parapsychology department \u2014 the "Murray Thompson Building" \u2014 is the real-life James Weir Building, the home of the University of Strathclyde's Mechanical Engineering department, and is used extensively for interior and exterior shots in the series.\u000aSome scenes were shot in Edinburgh.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Episode list ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Series 1 (2004) ===\u000aThis series won the Scottish BAFTA for best drama. Even though they only appear in this series, Dr. Monaghan's two assistants, Megan Sharma and Andrew Gemmil, are not formally written out in the concluding story. Phil Collinson produced this series only, moving immediately thereafter to Doctor Who.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Series 2 (2005) ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Series 3 (2006) ===\u000aThis series offered a change to the format. Instead of three, two-part mysteries, aired over the course of three weeks, this series offered a more traditional six-week episodic format. As with the first series, however, the student assistants made their final appearances in the concluding story without their departures being explained.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Series 4 (2007) ===\u000aThis series features Dr. Monaghan without any student assistants. Music for this series was provided by Sheridan Tongue, and was his sole contribution to Sea of Souls.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aSea of Souls at BBC Programmes \u000aSea of Souls at TV.com\u000aSea of Souls on IMDb

aVHighway 128 (AR 128, Ark. 128, and Hwy. 128) is a designation for four east\u2013west state highways in Southwest Arkansas. One route of 11.99 miles (19.30 km) begins at Highway 7 in Sparkman and runs east to Highway 9 at Holly Springs. A second route of 6.23 miles (10.03 km) begins at Highway 51 at Joan and runs east to Highway 7/Highway 8 at Gravel Junction. A third route begins at Highway 7 near DeGray Lake Resort State Park and runs east and north to US Highway 270 Business (US 270B) in Hot Springs. A fourth route begins at Highway 5 in Fountain Lake and runs east to US 70. All routes are maintained by the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ArDOT).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Route description ==\u000aAll four routes are low-traffic, two-lane, undivided roads winding through the Piney Woods of Southwest Arkansas. No segment of Highway 157 has been listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.\u000aThe ArDOT maintains Highway 128 like all other parts of the state highway system. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic using its roads in surveys using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). ArDOT estimates the traffic level for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year in these surveys.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Sparkman to Holly Springs ===\u000aHighway 128 begins at Sparkman, a small town in rural Dallas County. It runs due east as Main Street, passing Sparkman Elementary School and Sparkman High School before entering downtown. Continuing east, Highway 128 exits the town and enters a rural, forested area. It passes through the unincorporated community of New Hope, and intersects Highway 207 at Pine Grove. Near Pine Grove, Highway 128 passes the historic Sardis Methodist Church, listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Continuing southeasterly, Highway 128 passes near the Brazeale Homestead, also listed on the NRHP, before crossing Tulip Creek and White Oak Creek. Southeast of these creek crossings, a proposed intersection with Highway 273 is marked on the county map produced by ArDOT (as of January 2018). The Highway 273 extension was approved in 1973, but remains unbuilt. Highway 128 continues southeast to Holly Springs, passing the NRHP-listed Capt. Goodgame House. In Holly Springs, Highway 128 terminates at an intersection with Highway 9.\u000aAADT for the highway was highest at the western terminus, 1,600 vehicles per day. Outside the city limits of Sparkman, the traffic counts dropped below 1,000 with a low of 740 between Pine Grove and Holly Springs.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Joan to Gravel Ridge ===\u000aThe highway begins at Highway 51 east of Arkadelphia. It runs south through a sparsely populated rural area with swamps, sloughs, and pine trees, crossing L'eau Frais Creek and becoming a section line road southbound. The highway passes a small, discontinuous segment of the Big Timber Wildlife Management Area (WMA) south of the creek crossing. Highway 128 turns west at Mill Creek, terminating at an intersection with Highway 7/Highway 8 at Gravel Junction. Other than the termini, Highway 128 does not intersect any other state highways. AADT for the highway was estimated to be 270 VPD at a point north of the route's midpoint in 2016.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== De Gray Lake Resort State Park to Hot Springs ===\u000a\u000aHighway 128 begins north of DeGray Lake Resort State Park in the Ouachita Mountains. It runs east across Caney Creek to Caney, where it serves as the northern terminus of Highway 283. Highway 128 turns north at the junction, weaving through a sparsely populated pine forest. The route briefly overlaps Highway 84 at De Roche. North of the overlap, Highway 128 becomes the eastern edge of the Jack Mountain WMA, which offers deer, turkey, and bear hunting (among others) to permitted hunters through the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (AGFC). Upon entering Garland County, Highway 128 begins an overlap with Highway 290 around the southeastern edge of Lake Hamilton, with the concurrency ending just north of Red Oak. The highway bridges the Ouachita River between Lake Hamilton and Lake Catherine just east of Carpenter Dam before entering Hot Springs, the county seat of Garland County, where it becomes Carpenter Dam Road. Highway 128 winds north through an undeveloped section of the city before crossing US Highway 70 (US 70) and US 270, known as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway in Hot Springs, at exit 7. North of this interchange, the highway passes an industrial facility and the Arkansas State Police Troop K Headquarters before terminating at a junction with US 270B (Malvern Avenue).\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Fountain Lake to US 70 ===\u000aIn northeast Garland County, Highway 128 begins at Highway 5 (Park Avenue) in Fountain Lake. The entire length of the highway is known as Lonsdale Cutoff Road.\u000aThe highway runs east across the South Fork Ouachita River, with a historic 1928 bridge paralleling the highway's modern span. East of the town, Highway 128 passes through rural forested area, nearing the Saline County line before turning southward. Highway 128 briefly enters Saline County before returning to Garland County, intersecting US 70, where the route terminates. The roadway continues south to Lonsdale as a county road. AADT for the highway was estimated to be 1,700 VPD near the eastern terminus in 2016.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe first section of Highway 128 was created between Holly Springs and Pine Grove in 1937, replacing State Road 7A.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Major intersections ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aList of state highways in Arkansas\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a Media related to Arkansas Highway 128 at Wikimedia Commons

aVPinus hartwegii (syn. P. rudis, P. donnell-smithii), Hartweg's pine, is a pine native to the mountains of Mexico and Central America east to Honduras. It is named after Karl Theodor Hartweg, who discovered it in 1838.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Distribution ==\u000aPinus hartwegii is a very high altitude species, growing at altitudes of 2,500\u20134,300 metres (8,200\u201314,100 ft). It forms the alpine tree line on most of Mexico's higher mountains. It grows on both the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental (mountain ranges) (29° North latitude) from Chihuahua State and Nuevo León (26°) to the highest peaks in the mountain ranges on the El Salvador\u2014Honduras border (15° North latitude). In the Sierra Madre Occidental this pine grows with very dry winters and a very heavy rainy season in summer, with constant frosts from October to March.\u000aThis pine does not acquire the dwarfed and contorted shape shared by many species at high altitudes. Even at the alpine tree line, this tree is not damaged by the cold and wind-blown ice present at that altitude. Consequently, Pinus hartwegii has been studied as an evolutionarily unique member on tree line ecophysiology.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description ==\u000aPinus hartwegii is an evergreen tree reaching 20\u201330 metres (66\u201398 ft) in height, with a broad, rounded crown. The bark is thick, dark grey-brown, and scaly or fissured. The leaves are needle-like, dark green, five (occasionally four) per fascicle, 10\u201320 cm long and 1.2-1.5 mm thick, the persistent fascicle sheath 1.5\u20132 cm long.\u000aThe cones are ovoid, 6\u201313 cm long, black or very dark purple, opening when mature in spring to 5\u20137 cm broad. The seeds are winged, 5\u20136 mm long with a 1.5-2.5 cm wing. Pollination is in late spring, with the cones maturing 20\u201322 months after.\u000aIt is closely related to Pinus montezumae (Montezuma pine) , differing from it in the shorter leaves, black (not brown) and smaller cones; it replaces Montezuma pine at high altitudes, and often hybridises with it where they meet at middle altitudes.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000aConifer Specialist Group (1998).

aVThe Shadow Cabinet is a feature of the Westminster system of government. It consists of a senior group of opposition spokespeople who, under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, form an alternative cabinet to that of the government, and whose members shadow or mirror the positions of each individual member of the Cabinet. It is the Shadow Cabinet's responsibility to scrutinise the policies and actions of the government, as well to offer an alternative program.\u000aIn most countries, a member of the shadow cabinet is referred to as a Shadow Minister. In Canada, however, the term Opposition Critic is more common. In the United Kingdom's House of Lords and in New Zealand, the term "spokesperson" is used instead of "shadow".\u000aMembers of a shadow cabinet are often but not always appointed to a Cabinet post if and when their party forms government.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cultural applications ==\u000aIn the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand the major opposition party and specifically its shadow cabinet is called His or Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. The adjective "loyal" is used because, while the role of the opposition is to oppose Her Majesty's Government, it does not dispute the sovereign's right to the throne and therefore the legitimacy of the government. However, in other countries that use the Westminster system, the opposition is known simply as The Parliamentary Opposition.\u000aSome parliamentary parties, notably the Australian Labor Party, elect all the members of their shadow cabinets in a party room ballot, with the Leader of the Opposition then allocating portfolios to the Shadow Ministers. In other parliamentary parties, the membership and composition of the Shadow Cabinet is generally determined solely by the Leader of the Opposition.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Third parties ===\u000aIn many jurisdictions, third parties (which are neither participant in the government nor in the official opposition) may also form their own parliamentary front benches of spokespersons; however, parliamentary standing orders on the right of parties to speak often dictate that it can only be granted to a party or group if a minimum number of members can be recorded by the party. In Ireland, for example, technical groups are often formed by third parties and independent TDs in the Dáil Éireann in order to increase the members' right to speak against larger parties which can afford the right to speak as Front Benches in Government or Opposition.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Use outside English-speaking countries ===\u000aWhile the practice of parliamentary shadow cabinets or frontbenches is not widespread in Germany, party leaders have often formed boards of experts and advisors ("teams of experts", or Kompetenzteam, in CDU/CSU and SPD parlance; alternate "top team", or Spitzenteam, in Alliance '90/The Greens parlance).\u000a\u000a\u000a== By country ==\u000aAustralia\u000aShadow Cabinet of Australia (Australian Labor Party) (Bill Shorten)\u000a\u000aNew South Wales\u000aNew South Wales Shadow Cabinet (Australian Labor Party) (Luke Foley)\u000a\u000aThe Bahamas\u000aShadow Cabinet (Progressive Liberal Party) (Perry Christie)\u000aCanada\u000aOfficial Opposition Shadow Cabinet of the 42nd Parliament of Canada (Conservative Party of Canada) (Andrew Scheer)\u000a\u000aOntario\u000aOfficial Opposition Shadow Cabinet of the 41st Legislative Assembly of Ontario (Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario) (Patrick Brown)\u000a\u000aIreland\u000aOpposition Front Bench (Ireland) (Fianna Fáil) (Micheál Martin)\u000aItaly\u000aShadow Cabinet of Italy (Governo ombra) (Walter Veltroni)\u000aJamaica\u000aShadow Cabinet of Jamaica (People's National Party)\u000aJapan\u000aDemocratic Party of Japan (Renh\u014d Murata)\u000aLithuania\u000aShadow Cabinet of Lithuania (\u0160e\u0161\u0117linis kabinetas) (Andrius Kubilius).\u000aMalaysia\u000aShadow Cabinet of Malaysia (Democratic Action Party)\u000aNew Zealand\u000aOfficial Opposition (New Zealand) (New Zealand National Party) (Bill English)\u000a\u000aSecond Shadow Cabinet of Bill English\u000a\u000aPoland\u000aShadow Cabinet (Civic Platform led by Grzegorz Schetyna)\u000aSerbia\u000aShadow Cabinet (Serbian: \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0443 \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438)\u000aSri Lanka\u000aJoined Opposition (led by ex-President Mahinda Rajapakshe)\u000aSlovenia\u000aShadow Cabinet (Slovenska demokratska stranka)\u000aSolomon Islands\u000aShadow Cabinet of Solomon Islands (Democratic Party and allies)\u000aSouth Africa\u000aOfficial Opposition Shadow Cabinet (South Africa) (Democratic Alliance) (Mmusi Maimane)\u000aThailand\u000aShadow Cabinet (Democrat Party) (Abhisit Vejjajiva)\u000aUkraine\u000aShadow Government (Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko, Arseniy Yatsenyuk)\u000aUnited Kingdom\u000aOfficial Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom) (Labour) (Jeremy Corbyn)\u000a\u000aScotland\u000aShadow Cabinet (Scottish Parliament) (Scottish Conservatives) (Ruth Davidson)\u000a\u000aWales\u000aOfficial Shadow Cabinet (National Assembly for Wales) (Plaid Cymru) (Leanne Wood) & (Welsh Conservatives) (Andrew RT Davies)\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aShadow government (disambiguation)\u000aMinority leader\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

His father Demosthenes set up a company importing dried fruit. Ciclitira was educated at Wycliffe School, and was then sent to Greece to learn the family business.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Military service in World War II ==\u000aIn 1939 Ciclitira enlisted into the Territorial Army, serving in the 2/4th Essex Regiment, before graduating from an Officer Cadet Training Unit and being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the South Staffordshire Regiment on 20 April 1940.\u000aAfter two years with the Staffordshires, Ciclitira volunteered to serve with the Special Operations Executive, and in October 1942 was assigned to "Force 133", SOE's Cretan section, based in Cairo. He was responsible for organising clandestine deliveries of arms and supplies to the Cretan resistance, and also the exfiltration of those for whom it had become too dangerous to remain. In December 1943 Ciclitira took over from Xan Fielding as commander of SOE activities in western Crete, operating from a mountain hideout near Canea. In May 1944, after the abduction of General Kreipe, Ciclitira organized the evacuation of Patrick Leigh Fermor, W. Stanley Moss, and their captive by Motor Launch, and met them at a remote beach on the southern coast. Just as Leigh Fermor and Moss realised that neither knew enough Morse to make the correct recognition code Ciclitira arrived, having been ordered to return to Cairo, took the torch, called them "bloody fools", and made the correct signal.\u000aCiclitira returned to Crete in September 1944, remaining there until the end of the war. In March 1945, he negotiated a prisoner exchange, swapping 36 German prisoners for 12 Cretans, including Konstantinos Mitsotakis, later the Prime Minister of Greece. On 8 May 1945, V-E day, Ciclitira arranged for Generalmajor Hans-Georg Benthack to formally surrender all German forces on the island to Major-General Colin Callander.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Post-war career ==\u000aOn 23 May 1946 Ciclitira received a mention in despatches "in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in the Mediterranean Theatre".\u000aHis father having died in 1943, Ciclitira and his brother John, revived the family business in the late 1950s, forming Demos Ciclitira Ltd. The company remains one of the UK's leading importers of dried fruit, as well as other products, and is run by Ciclitira's nephew Andrew.\u000aDennis Ciclitira died on 9 June 2000.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aRobertson, John (9 February 2007).

aVThe heat wave dubbed Lucifer or Jolanda (by the Deutscher Wetterdienst) was an extreme heat wave that affected Southern Europe in 2017. It started at the end of July, and lasted till the fifth of August, before conditions gradually began to cool down again. Some countries that were affected included Italy, France, Croatia, Spain, Greece and Turkey. Those countries experienced temperatures of 40 °C (104 °F) or more, killing at least five people in the process. The remainder of August was very warm, with temperatures around 30 °C (86 °F), but not dangerously hot as it had been earlier on in the month.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aOctober 2017 Iberian wildfires\u000a2017 Portugal wildfires\u000a2017 wildfire season\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVAntony and Cleopatra, Op. 40, is an opera in three acts by American composer Samuel Barber. The libretto was prepared by Franco Zeffirelli. It was based on the play Antony and Cleopatra by William Shakespeare and made use of Shakespeare's language exclusively.\u000aThe opera was first performed on September 16, 1966, commissioned for the opening of the new Metropolitan Opera House in Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. After an unsuccessful premiere, the opera was extensively revised by Barber and Gian Carlo Menotti in an edition first performed in 1975.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Performance history ==\u000aFor the world premiere\u2014also the opening of the new Metropolitan Opera House\u2014no expense was spared, with the creative team including Zeffirelli himself directing and designing the production. The team included revolutionary choreographer Alvin Ailey, conductor Thomas Schippers and a top rate cast headed by Leontyne Price as Cleopatra. Condensing Shakespeare's text from five acts in over forty scenes to three acts over three hours, Zeffirelli preserved much of the speaking style of the original tragedy. The stage design and costumes were elaborate; the cast was enormous including 22 principal singers, a full chorus, dozens of extras and a troupe of ballet dancers\u2014a company of 400 performers on stage (Fiedler 2003, 56\u201369). Quickly utilizing the limits of the cutting-edge technology of the new opera house, the mammoth production was not without problems. A technical error during early rehearsals broke the house's new turntable, causing the entire production to be restaged with movable scenery units. A large hydraulic pyramid of steel, brass and aluminium dominated the stage with fold up sides that famously trapped Price during the dress rehearsal.\u000aThe opera was poorly received by the press, and not enthusiastically received by the public (Freeman 1997, 15; Heyman 1992b). Among the reasons cited for the opera's lack of success were an "inflated production with problematic technical apparatus, gaudy costumes, overcrowded stage forces and a press overly attentive to the social glitter of the occasion" (Heyman 1992a). Less kindly, the 1966 premiere was retrospectively described as "a hair-curlingly awful production. \u2026 The night has gone down in the annals of opera as a landmark of vulgarity and staging excess. Mr. Barber\u2019s score, as we discovered from subsequent exposure to revised excerpts in concert and on records, was to a great extent an innocent victim of the over-all fiasco" (Henahan 1975). The opera was dropped from the Met's repertory after the initial eight performances of the production. The radio broadcast of the premiere, rarely heard after the initial broadcast, was released in 2016, upon the 50th anniversary of the premiere.\u000aBarber later revised the opera, with text revisions by Gian-Carlo Menotti, Barber's partner and the librettist of his first opera, Vanessa (Heyman 1992a). This version was premiered under Menotti's direction at the Juilliard American Opera Center on February 6, 1975 (Freeman 1997, 15). It was given its European premiere in 1980 in concert version at the Théâtre des Champs Elysées, Paris, as part of the "Saison Lyrique de Radio France" under its Music Director, Jean-Pierre Marty. There were further productions at the Spoleto Festival USA and Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto, Italy, in 1983, and the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1991 (Heyman 1992a).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Roles ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Recordings ==\u000aTwo complete commercial recordings of the opera exist (one of the premiere of the original version, the other of the revision), as well as two scenes sung by Leontyne Price.\u000aSamuel Barber: Two Scenes from Antony and Cleopatra, Op. 40 ["Give Me Some Music" and "Give Me My Robe"], Knoxville: Summer of 1915, Op. 24.

aVThe Bell UH-1Y Venom (also called Super Huey) is a twin-engine, medium-sized utility helicopter, built by Bell Helicopter under the H-1 upgrade program of the United States Marine Corps. One of the latest members of the numerous Huey family, the UH-1Y is also called "Yankee", based on the NATO phonetic alphabet pronunciation of its variant letter.\u000aThe UH-1Y was to have been remanufactured from UH-1Ns, but in 2005, it was approved for the aircraft to be built as new. After entering service in 2008, the UH-1Y is currently in full-rate production to replace the USMC's aging fleet of UH-1N Twin Huey light utility helicopters, first introduced in the early 1970s.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Development ==\u000aIn 1996, the United States Marine Corps launched the H-1 upgrade program by signing a contract with Bell Helicopter for upgrading 100 UH-1Ns into UH-1Ys and upgrading 180 AH-1Ws into AH-1Zs. The H-1 program created completely modernized attack and utility helicopters with considerable design commonality to reduce operating costs. The UH-1Y and AH-1Z share a common tailboom, engines, rotor system, drivetrain, avionics architecture, software, controls and displays for over 84% identical components.\u000aOver the years new avionics and radios, in addition to modern door guns and safety upgrades, have greatly increased the UH-1N's empty weight. With a maximum speed of approximately 100 knots (190 km/h) and an inability to lift much more than its own crew, fuel and ammunition, the UH-1N, while useful, is limited in its utility.\u000a\u000aThe Y-model upgrades pilot avionics to a glass cockpit, adds further safety modifications and provides the UH-1 with a modern FLIR system. However, the biggest improvement is an increase in engine power. By replacing the engines and the two-bladed rotor system with four composite blades, the Y-model will return the Huey to the utility role for which it was designed. Originally the UH-1Y was to have been remanufactured from UH-1N airframes, but in April 2005 approval was granted to build them as new helicopters.\u000aThe Y-model updates an airframe that has been central to Marine Corps aviation in Iraq. The Huey has many mission requirements including command and control (C2), escort, reconnaissance, troop transport, medical evacuation and close air support. Typically detachments of two to four Hueys have been deployed with detachments of four to eight Cobras. The forward-mounted weaponry of the Cobra combined with the door guns of the Huey provides a 240° field of fire.\u000aBell delivered two UH-1Ys to the U.S. Marine Corps in February 2008 and full-rate production was begun in September 2009. The Marine Corps plans to buy 160 Y-models to replace their inventory of N-models.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Design ==\u000a\u000aThe UH-1Y variant modernizes the UH-1 design. Its most noticeable upgrade over previous variants is a four-blade, all-composite rotor system designed to withstand up to 23 mm rounds. A 21-inch (530 mm) fuselage extension just forward of the main door has been added for more capacity. The UH-1Y features upgraded engines and transmissions, a digital cockpit with flat panel multifunctional displays, and an 84% parts commonality with the AH-1Z. Compared to the UH-1N, the Y-model has an increased payload, almost 50% greater range, a reduction in vibration, and higher cruise speed.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Operational history ==\u000a\u000aThe UH-1Y and AH-1Z completed their developmental testing in early 2006. During the first quarter of 2006 the UH-1Ys were transferred to the Operational Test Unit at the NAS Patuxent River, where they began operational evaluation (OPEVAL) testing. In February 2008, the UH-1Y and AH-1Z began the second and final portion of OPEVAL testing.\u000aOn 8 August 2008, the Marine Corps certified the UH-1Y as operationally capable and it was deployed for the first time in January 2009 as part of the aviation combat element of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit. The UH-1N Twin Huey was retired by the Marines in August 2014, making the UH-1Y the Marine Corps' standard utility helicopter.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Potential operators ===\u000aOn 11 October 2017, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified the United States Congress of the potential sale of 12 UH-1Ys and related systems and support to the Czech Republic for a cost of US$575m.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Operators ==\u000a United States\u000aUnited States Marine CorpsHMLA-167\u000aHMLA-169\u000aHMLA-267\u000aHMLA-269\u000aHMLA-367\u000aHMLA-369\u000aHMLA-469\u000aHMLA-773\u000aHMLAT-303\u000a\u000a\u000a== Specifications ==\u000a\u000aData from Bell UH-1Y guide, International Directory of Civil Aircraft\u000aGeneral characteristics\u000aCrew: one or two pilots, plus crew chief, other crew members as mission requires\u000aCapacity: 6,660 lb (3,020 kg) including up to ten crashworthy passenger seats, six litters or equivalent cargo\u000aLength: 58 ft 4 in (17.78 m)\u000aRotor diameter: 48 ft 10 in (14.88 m)\u000aHeight: 14 ft 7 in (4.5 m)\u000aDisc area: 1,808 ft² (168.0 m²)\u000aEmpty weight: 11,840 lb (5,370 kg)\u000aUseful load: 6,660 lb (3,020 kg)\u000aMax. takeoff weight: 18,500 lb (8,390 kg)\u000aPowerplant: 2 × General Electric T700-GE-401C turboshaft, 1,828 shp for 2.5 min; 1,546 shp continuous (1,360 kW for 2.5 min; 1,150 kW continuous) each\u000aPerformance\u000aNever exceed speed: 198 knots (227 mph, 366 km/h)\u000aMaximum speed: 164 kn (189 mph, 304 km/h) for 30 minutes\u000aCruise speed: 158 kn, 182 mph, 293 km/h (long range cruise (LRC): 135 kn, 155 mph, 250 km/h)\u000aCombat radius: 130 nmi (150 mi, 241 km) with 2,182 lb, 990 kg payload\u000aEndurance: 3.3 hr\u000aService ceiling: 20,000+ ft (6,100+ m)\u000aRate of climb: 2,520 ft/min (12.8 m/s)\u000aArmament\u000a2 external stations for 70 mm (2.75 in) Hydra 70 or APKWS II rockets\u000a2 pintle mounts for 7.62×51 mm M240D machine guns, .50 in (12.7 mm) GAU-16/A machine guns, or 7.62×51 mm NATO GAU-17/A Gatling guns\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aUS Helicopter Armament Subsystems\u000aList of active United States military aircraft\u000aRelated development\u000aBell 212\u000aBell 412\u000aBell UH-1N Twin Huey\u000aBell AH-1Z Viper\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aUH-1Y Venom page on BellHelicopter.com\u000aUH-1Y Venom page on US Navy RDA site\u000aUH-1Y Venom page on GlobalSecurity.org\u000a"US Navy proposes more UH-1Ys, AH-1Zs despite test phase setback", Flight International, 22 August 2008.

aVDr. Jeffrey Alan Lockwood (born 1960) is an award-winning author and University of Wyoming professor of Natural Sciences and Humanities. He writes both nonfiction science books, as well as meditations. Lockwood is the recipient of both the Pushcart Prize and the John Burroughs Medal.\u000aLockwood earned a B.S. degree in biology from New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, where he was the 1982 recipient of the Brown Award. He received a Ph.D. in entomology from Louisiana State University, after completing a dissertation entitled The behavioral ecology of the first instar southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.).\u000aHis career at the University of Wyoming began as Assistant Professor of Entomology before becoming Professor of Natural Sciences and Humanities, then transferring to the philosophy department and teaching in the Master of Fine Arts program in creative writing.\u000aLockwood has authored numerous articles, some of which have been licensed by government entities, such as the Wyoming Water Research Center. In 2000, he co-authored Grasshoppers and Grassland Health for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. His most recent science book, Six-legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War, is a historical account of entomological bioterrorism from early days through the present, and the near future. A guest of the world: Meditations is Lockwood's latest book on spirituality under Skinner House Books, a book publisher run by the Unitarian Universalist Association.\u000aLockwood and other scholars at the University of Wyoming have recently become locked in a debate with university administration, and Wyoming business and energy leaders over what he and others have argued is a clear case of the infringement of academic freedom. According to emails and reports released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the sitting university President, Tom Buchanan, ordered the destruction of Carbon Sink, an artwork created by Chris Drury (artist), after Wyoming energy and business leaders considered it an untoward criticism of the industry that partly subsidizes the university through severance tax. Although Wyoming industry leaders have called for a moratorium on the debate, the university administration's infringement of academic freedom has become the hot-button topic while the university seeks a replacement for Buchanan, upon his scheduled retirement in July 2013.\u000aLockwood is married, and has a son and daughter. He is a member of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Laramie, Wyoming, USA. He also appears as a character in Tectonic Theater Project's The Laramie Project and The Laramie Project: 10 Years Later.'''\u000a\u000a\u000a== Partial bibliography ==\u000aArticles\u000a(1987).

aVThe Rutgers tomato (Lycopersicon lycopersicum) was the most popular tomato variety in the world before the era of mechanized farming began a change in breeding for durability over flavor. It is a hybrid beefsteak from the Solanaceae family with an excellent balance of acidity to sweetness and lots of flavor. A true New Jersey tomato has both high acids and high sugars, and a thin skin. It lasts days at full ripeness, not weeks as modern, commercially bred tomatoes for automatic harvest and long-haul shipment, do.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aIt was developed in 1934 by Rutgers University's New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station and the Campbell Soup Company's Riverton, New Jersey research facility. A hugely flavorful tomato that also was more resistant to rot than its predecessors, the Rutgers tomato became a staple ingredient of not only Campbell\u2019s Soup, but other large companies including Hunt\u2019s and Heinz. It was popular on American dinner tables as the seed was grown by farmers nationally.\u000aIt was the most popular variety of tomato in the world, according to Thomas J. Orton, a professor in the department of plant biology and pathology at Rutgers University.  The Rutgers tomato, at its peak, made up more than 60% of all commercial tomato sales.  The Rutgers tomato plummeted in popularity with commercial farmers in the 1960s. Too thin skinned for automated picking, they fell out of favor with both farmers and commercial producers looking for heartier tomatoes that would store longer and travel farther with less spoilage. The seeds were not patented, so farmers and other companies "evolved" the Rutgers tomatoes into more refined hybrids that suited their needs better.\u000a\u000a\u000a== A Second Generation ==\u000aIn 2006, there was not enough commercial interest to "revive" the hybrids that were so popular from New Jersey. By 2009, though, Rutgers scientists at the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station (NJAES) launched the Jersey Tomato Project to revive the coveted Rutgers (Jersey) Tomato. Scientists had learned that Campbell Soup still had some genetic material from the parent plants of the original Rugters tomato. From 2009 to 2014, scientists and plant breeders worked to revive the cultivar through inbreeding, and discovering a change in soil amendment that had removed sodium from the fertilizers used on the soil. Dr. Josephy Heckman, a researcher in soil fertility at NJAES, also examined other key mineral deficiences in the soil that affect taste, including potassium and boron.\u000aAfter many experimental plantings, tastings, and adjustments in genetics, they finally debuted the Rutgers 250, named to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the university's founding in that same year.\u000a\u000a\u000a== AKA ==\u000aJersey tomato\u000aRutgers Select\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVJohn Bulwer (baptised 16 May 1606 \u2013 buried 16 October 1656 ) was an English physician and early Baconian natural philosopher  who wrote five works exploring the Body and human communication, particularly by gesture. He was the first person in England to propose educating deaf people,  the plans for an Academy he outlines in Philocophus and The Dumbe mans academie.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aJohn Bulwer was born in London in 1606 and continued to work and live in the city until his death in October 1656 when he was buried in St Giles in the Fields, Westminster. He was the only surviving son of an apothecary named Thomas Bulwer and Marie Evans of St. Albans. On her death in 1638 John Bulwer inherited some property in St Albans from which he derived a small income. Although information about his education is unclear, there is evidence that he was probably educated in Oxford as an unmatriculated student in the 1620s. His known friends had nearly all been educated there and he supported William Laud and the High Church party during the Civil War. Later in his life, between 1650 and 1653, he acquired a Medicinae Doctor (M.D.) at an unknown European university. In 1634 he married a woman known only as the "Widow of Middleton" who predeceased him. No children from this marriage are known to have been born. Later in life Bulwer would adopt a girl named Chirothea Johnson, and, as he states in his will "bred her up from a child as my own". She may have been deaf.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Published works ==\u000aDuring the English Civil War Bulwer stopped working as a physician and concentrated on his study and writing. All his written works were created between 1640 and until around 1653. In total Bulwer published five works, all of which were either early examples or the first of their kind.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Chirologia and Chironomia ==\u000a\u000aChirologia: or the naturall language of the hand. Composed of the speaking motions, and discoursing gestures thereof. Whereunto is added Chironomia: or, the art of manuall rhetoricke. Consisting of the naturall expressions, digested by art in the hand, as the chiefest instrument of eloquence. London: Thomas Harper. 1644.\u000aAlthough issued as a single volume Chirologia and Chironomia have different pagination. Bulwer always referred to them as separate works but over time they have come to be seen as a single volume. Francis Bacon had described gestures as "Transient Hieroglyphics" and suggested that Gesture should be the focus of a new scientific enquiry, Bulwer was the first to undertake the task. For Bulwer Gesture was a universal character of Reason.\u000a\u000a[The hand] \u201cspeaks all languages, and as universal character of Reason is generally understood and known by all Nations, among the formal differences of their Tongue. And being the only speech that is natural to Man, it may well be called the Tongue and General language of Human Nature, which, without teaching, men in all regions of the habitable world doe at the first sight most easily understand\u201d\u000a\u000aChirologia is often cited as Bulwer\u2019s link to later Deaf studies because it focuses on hand gestures  which have come to be seen as the domain of deaf communication. In fact the book only mentions the deaf in passing. He believed it was Nature's recompense that deaf people should communicate through gesture, "that wonder of necessity that Nature worketh in men that are born deafe and dumb; who can argue and dispute rhetorically by signes" (page 5). The handshapes described in Chirologia are still used in British Sign Language. Bulwer does mention fingerspelling describing how "the ancients did...order an alphabet upon the joints of their fingers...showing those letters by a distinct and grammatical succession", in addition to their use as mnemonic devices Bulwer suggest that manual alphabets could be "ordered to serve for privy ciphers for any secret intimation" (Chironomia, p149). Chirologia is a compendium of manual gestures, citing their meaning and use from a wide range of sources; literary, Religious and Medical. Chironomia is a manual for the effective use of Gesture in public speaking.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Philocophus ==\u000a\u000aPhilocophus: or, the deafe and dumbe mans friend. Exhibiting the philosophicall verity of that subtile art, which may inable one with an observant eie, to heare what any man speaks by the moving of his lips. Upon the same ground, with the advantage of an historical exemplification, apparently proving, that a man borne deafe and dumbe, may be taught to heare the sound of words with his eie, & thence learne to speake with his tongue. ; By J. B. surnamed the Chirosopher London: Humphrey Moseley 1648.\u000aBulwer was the first person in Britain to discuss the possibility educating deaf people, and the novelty of the idea, and seeming impossibility, is shown when Bulwer tries to persuade "some rational men" to support the establishment of a "new Academy", to them "the attempt seemed paradoxical, prodigious and hyperbolical; that it did rather amuse than satisfy their understanding" (from the introduction). To persuade these "knowing men" of "the philosophical verity of this Art" (the education of the deaf) he sets out in this volume to explain the theory and empirical evidence for its possibility. Some evidence comes from the account given by Sir Kenelm Digby of a meeting between the Prince of Wales and a deaf Spanish nobleman, Don Luis Velasco. As well as drawing heavily on this account, he also collects information about deaf people living in Britain at that time. Through observations that some deaf people can "hear" the vibrations produced by musical instruments by bone conduction through the teeth, Bulwer came to believe that the body had a commonwealth of senses, for instance the eye could be used to perceive speech by lip-reading.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Pathomyotomia ==\u000aPathomyotomia, or a Dissection of the significant Muscles of the Affections of the Mind. Being an Essay to a new Method of observing the most important movings of the Muscles of the Head, as they are the neerest and Immediate Organs of the Voluntarie or Impetuous motions of the Mind. With the Proposall of a new Nomenclature of the Muscles. London: Humphrey Moseley. 1649\u000aThis was the first substantial English language work on the muscular basis of emotional expressions. The goal was to present a new and more intuitive system for naming the muscles of the face. A system in which muscles would be named after the passions they were used to express. It would be 200 years before similar ideas would surface in French anatomist and electrophysiologist Duchenne de Boulogne's Mecanisme de la Physiognomie Humaine (1862). The other observation of Duchenne that Bulwer foreshadowed was that the contraction of the orbicularis oculi (the muscle encircling the eye) accompanies genuine smiles of happiness but does not occur in deceptive or non-joyful smiles.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Anthropometamorphosis ==\u000aAnthropometamorphosis: Man Transform\u2019d, or the Artificial Changeling. Historically presented, in the mad and cruel Gallantry, foolish Bravery, ridiculous Beauty, filthy Fineness, and loathesome Loveliness of most Nations, fashioning & altering their Bodies from the Mould intended by Nature. With a Vindication of the Regular Beauty and Honesty of Nature, and an Appendix of the Pedigree of the English Gallant. London: J. Hardesty. 1650\u000aAnthropometamorphosis was Bulwer's final and most popular work, reprinted at least three times in his lifetime. First in 1650, the second edition of 1653 was much enlarged and illustrated with woodcuts. A third edition "printed for the use and benefit of Thomas Gibbs, gent" was a reissue of the second edition retitled "A view of the People of the whole World". The title literally means \u2018humanity-changing\u2019. It could be seen as another work influenced by Francis Bacon, an Anomatia Comparata, a comparison of all the peoples of the world, and in its attack on the cosmetic it does echo Bacon. It is one of the first studies in comparative cultural anthropology albeit with a strong tone of social commentary, "Almost every Nation having a particular whimzey as touching corporall fashions of their own invention" (page 5), Bulwer describes how people modify their bodies and clothes but later commentators have interpreted this ostensible apolitical work as a coded piece of political theory. A political commentary against the artificial (in Bulwer's eyes) regicidal State, and a call to the return to the "natural" form of governance with the King as the symbolic head of the body of England. Bulwer\u2019s politics are indivisible from his other thinking, for him Nature was a Monarch, "sovereignty delegated from God". "The beauty of the Universe consists in things perfect and permanent" (p25) ruled over by the monarch, Nature. Although Bulwer does not make any direct reference to the political events in England his approach to the monstrous body echoes the themes of the polemical literature of the time, especially in its focus on the head. The main body of the text consists of 23 sections, of which 15 are concerned with deformations or modifications to the head or face. The book ends with Bulwer stating that he is going to stop writing and return to working as a physician. He writes:\u000a\u000aUntil now obeying the sacred impulse of the genius operating upon our intellectual complexion, while my mind was carrying me into new things, I executed works not of supererogation, but supplemental to the advancement of sciences. In which I seem to have merited something from the republec of letters (i.e. Literary public): "Of the making of many books there is no end, and the reading of them is a weariness to the flesh" (Eccles xii.12): From now on I shall apply myself entirly to providing for my own health and the health of others. Other things will be done by other lovers of human nature. THE END.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Manuscripts and other works ==\u000aIn addition there are two surviving unpublished manuscripts held at the British Library:\u000a'Philocophus, or the Dumbe mans academie wherein is taught a new and admired art instructing them who are borne Deafe and Dumbe to heare the sound of words with theire eie and thence learne to speake with theire Tongue:' illustrated with engraved plates shewing the different portions of the hands. (Held under Sloane 1788 at the British Library).\u000aThis manuscript shows that Bulwer was the first person in England to acquire and translate Juan Pablo Bonet's Reducción de las letras y arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos ("Summary of the letters and the art of teaching speech to the mute") because it contains images cut and pasted directly from Bonet's book as well as commentary on the methods described therein. This manuscript is usually referred to as the Dumbe mans academie to differentiate it clearly from the earlier published work also entitled Philocophus.\u000aThe other manuscript held is entitled Vultispex criticus, seu physiognomia medici. A manuscript on Physiognomy.\u000aThere are also a selection of works that are now lost including one study, entitled Glossiatrus, on speech disorders and another, Otiatrus on hearing disorders. Glossiatrus was the first monograph on speech disorders ever written.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes and references ==

aVDavid Alexander Edwards (born 3 February 1986) is a professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Championship club Reading and the Wales national team.\u000aEdwards began his career at hometown club Shrewsbury Town, making his professional debut in 2003. After three full seasons with the team in League Two he moved to Luton Town of League One in July 2007. Due to Luton's financial situation he moved the following January to Wolverhampton Wanderers for a fee believed to be £675,000. Edwards was part of the Wolves teams that won the Championship in 2009 and League One in 2013, and also played three seasons with the club in the Premier League. He totalled 307 games and 44 goals for the club before transferring to Reading in August 2017.\u000aA full international since 2007, Edwards has earned over 40 caps for Wales. He represented the nation at UEFA Euro 2016.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Club career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Shrewsbury Town ===\u000aBorn in Pontesbury, Shropshire, Edwards started as an apprentice at his hometown club, Shrewsbury Town, and made his professional debut in the final match of 2002\u201303 season as a 83rd-minute substitute for Jamie Tolley in a 2\u20131 defeat at home to Scunthorpe United on 3 May 2003, as Shrewsbury were relegated from the Football League.\u000aShrewsbury secured an instant promotion back to the Football League in 2003\u201304, though Edwards did not play a large role, making just 16 appearances. Upon the club's return to the Football League, Edwards became a regular first-team player, a role he retained for three successive seasons at Gay Meadow.\u000aTowards the end of the 2006\u201307 season, Edwards was the subject of transfer speculation, after rejecting an offered extension to his Shrewsbury contract. He was then controversially left out of the play-off final against Bristol Rovers by then-manager Gary Peters, despite playing an important role in their run to the final. Shrewsbury lost the match 3\u20131 at Wembley Stadium and missed out on promotion to League One.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Luton Town ===\u000aOn 26 June 2007, Edwards signed for Luton Town on a three-year contract. As he was under 24, Shrewsbury commanded a compensation fee to cover his youth development. The eventual fee was agreed at a tribunal, but clubs reported differing figures; Luton claiming it was £250,000, with Shrewsbury reporting £250,000 as the initial payment, plus a further £150,000 based on appearances. He made his debut on the opening day of 2007\u201308, starting in Luton's 2\u20131 home win over Hartlepool United. Edwards scored his first goal for Luton with the equaliser in a 2\u20131 away defeat to Swindon Town a week later.\u000aEdwards made 19 league appearances for Luton Town in League One and scored four goals. However, the club was struggling financially and were only able to pay their players' weekly wages twice in three months, hence a 10-point deduction. He became linked with Championship teams Watford and Nottingham Forest after a strong performance in an FA Cup third round match at home to Liverpool. Luton accepted a £675,000 offer from Wolverhampton Wanderers.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Wolverhampton Wanderers ===\u000a\u000aOn 14 January 2008, Edwards signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Wolverhampton Wanderers. Five days after signing, Edwards made a goalscoring debut for the club in a 2\u20130 win away to Scunthorpe United. However, injuries kept him from playing a regular role in the remainder of the season. He returned fit for the following season, but found new signing David Jones often preferred alongside captain Karl Henry in central midfield; however, Edwards still started half the season's games as they won promotion to the Premier League. Following the conclusion of the season, Edwards signed a new three-year contract with the club.\u000aThe midfielder became a regular in the team after promotion, and contributed the winning goal against Fulham in the first home win of the season on 20 September 2009. He suffered ankle ligament damage that December which kept him out for four months, but he recovered to make five appearances in the closing months as the club retained their top-flight status. Edwards' contribution to Wolves in the 2010\u201311 season was severely hampered by injuries. He signed a new three-year contract with the club, including an option of a one-year extension, and made 12 appearances, scoring once in a 2\u20131 victory at home to Manchester City, where he scored past his former Shrewsbury team-mate, and lodger, Joe Hart.\u000aEdwards suffered two injury setbacks during the 2012\u201313 season, when he firstly tore his hamstring in December in a 4\u20131 win away to Bristol City, and after returning to first-team action, suffered a broken foot in the reverse fixture. Edwards remained with the club after they suffered a second consecutive relegation, scoring nine goals as the team won promotion back to the Championship at the first attempt as League One champions. On 13 June 2014, Edwards signed a new two-year contract with the club.\u000aOn 8 August 2015, he scored the winning goal in Wolves' first game of the 2015\u201316 season away to Blackburn Rovers, finishing Nouha Dicko's cross with his hand. Manager Kenny Jackett said after the game that the goal was scored by Edwards' hand, albeit not deliberately. Five days later, he signed a one-year contract extension to last until 2017. On 23 January 2016, Edwards broke the fifth metatarsal in his foot during a 1\u20131 draw away to Queens Park Rangers, ruling him out for three months. He returned to first-team football on 5 April as a 92nd-minute substitute for Joe Mason in a 2\u20131 win away to Milton Keynes Dons.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Reading ===\u000aOn 26 August 2017, Edwards signed for fellow Championship club Reading on a two-year contract for an undisclosed fee, reported by the Express & Star as £1 million. He made his debut as a 63rd-minute substitute in a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Bristol City on 9 September. Edwards scored his first goal for Reading on 26 September in a 2\u20131 defeat away to Millwall.\u000a\u000a\u000a== International career ==\u000a\u000aEdwards qualifies for Wales through his father from Welshpool. He had previously played for the Wales U17 and U19 teams making his U21 debut against Cyprus on 16 May 2006. He had been selected for the under-21 squad for an earlier friendly against Northern Ireland on 28 February 2006, but missed the match through injury.\u000aHis first experience with the senior team was under John Toshack on 12 September 2007, remaining an unused substitute against Slovakia. He made his full international debut on 17 November against the Republic of Ireland at the Millennium Stadium as a 37th-minute substitute for Carl Robinson in a 2\u20132 UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match.\u000aOn 10 October 2008, Edwards scored the opening goal in a 2010 World Cup qualifier against Liechtenstein, and against Azerbaijan on 6 June 2009. He ended the campaign with two goals. Following Wales' disappointing qualifying campaign, he was called up again for 14 November 2009 friendly against Scotland, a 3\u20130 win, and opened the scoring with a volley from Aaron Ramsey's assist in the 16th minute.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aEdwards attended Pontesbury's Mary Webb School and Science College and shared a house with England international Joe Hart during their days at Shrewsbury Town. Edwards still resides in Pontesbury with his wife Emma and their two children.\u000aIn 2015, Edwards and a friend opened a children's indoor soft play centre in Shrewsbury called Little Rascals. In 2017, Edwards launched his charity, The Little Rascals Foundation, aiming to help children with disabilities. The charity launch event, hosted by Jacqui Oatley with guest speaker Kit Symons, in the absence of Wales national football team manager Chris Coleman, was held at the New Meadow, the home of Edwards' hometown club Shrewsbury Town, and raised just under £13,000.\u000aEdwards wrote an autobiography, Living My Dream, which was released in December 2017. All proceeds went to his foundation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career statistics ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Club ===\u000aAs of match played 10 February 2018\u000a\u000a\u000a=== International ===\u000a\u000aAs of match played 14 November 2017\u000a\u000a\u000a=== International goals ===\u000aAs of match played 14 November 2017.

aVThis list of birds of Maryland includes species credibly documented in the U.S. state of Maryland and accepted by the Maryland / District of Columbia Records Committee (MRC) of the Maryland Ornithological Society as of November 2016. There are 449 species included in the official list. Eight additional species of questionable origin and two of exotic origin per the MRC are also included in this page. Of the 449 species, 108 are rare anywhere in the state, 56 are rare in some part of the state, six have been introduced to North America, three are extinct, and one has been extirpated.\u000aThis list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North American Birds, 7th edition through the 58th Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list.\u000aUnless otherwise noted, all species listed below are considered to occur regularly in Maryland as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The following tags are used to designate some species:\u000a(R) Rare - "Reviewable if found anywhere in Maryland" per the MRC\u000a(R*) Rare (limited area) - "Reviewable if found in certain specified ranges in Maryland" per the MRC\u000a(QO) Questionable origin - "Accepted species that may or may not be wild or naturally occurring" per the MRC\u000a(EO) Exotic origin - "Accepted species whose natural history precludes wild or natural occurrence" per the MRC\u000a(I) Introduced - a species that has been introduced to North America by the actions of humans, either directly or indirectly\u000a(X) Extinct - a recent species that no longer exists\u000a(E) Extirpated - a species which is no longer found in Maryland, but still exists elsewhere\u000a\u000a\u000a== Ducks, geese, and waterfowl ==\u000a\u000aOrder: Anseriformes   Family: Anatidae\u000aThe family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, bills that are flattened to a greater or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils. Forty-five confirmed species, two of questionable origin, and one of exotic origin have been recorded in Maryland.\u000aBlack-bellied whistling-duck, Dendrocygna autumnalis (R)\u000aFulvous whistling-duck, Dendrocygna bicolor (R)\u000aSnow goose, Anser caerulescens\u000aRoss's goose, Anser rossii\u000aGreater white-fronted goose, Anser albifrons\u000aPink-footed goose, Anser brachyrhynchus (R)\u000aBrant, Branta bernicla\u000aBarnacle goose, Branta leucopsis (R)\u000aCackling goose, Branta hutchinsii\u000aCanada goose, Branta canadensis\u000aMute swan, Cygnus olor (I)\u000aBlack swan, Cygnus atratus (EO) (not on the AOS Check-list; scientific name and placement are per Clements)\u000aTrumpeter swan, Cygnus buccinator\u000aTundra swan, Cygnus columbianus\u000aWood duck, Aix sponsa\u000aBaikal teal, Sibirionetta formosa (QO)\u000aBlue-winged teal, Spatula discors\u000aCinnamon teal, Spatula cyanoptera (R)\u000aNorthern shoveler, Spatula clypeata\u000aGadwall, Mareca strepera\u000aFalcated duck, Mareca falcata (O)\u000aEurasian wigeon, Mareca penelope\u000aAmerican wigeon, Mareca americana\u000aMallard, Anas platyrhynchos\u000aAmerican black duck, Anas rubripes\u000aNorthern pintail, Anas acuta\u000aGreen-winged teal, Anas crecca\u000aCanvasback, Aythya valisineria\u000aRedhead, Aythya americana\u000aRing-necked duck, Aythya collaris\u000aTufted duck, Aythya fuligula (R)\u000aGreater scaup, Aythya marila\u000aLesser scaup, Aythya affinis\u000aKing eider, Somateria spectabilis (R*)\u000aCommon eider, Somateria mollissima (R*)\u000aHarlequin duck, Histrionicus histrionicus (R*)\u000aSurf scoter, Melanitta perspicillata\u000aWhite-winged scoter, Melanitta fusca\u000aBlack scoter, Melanitta americana\u000aLong-tailed duck, Clangula hyemalis\u000aBufflehead, Bucephala albeola\u000aCommon goldeneye, Bucephala clangula\u000aBarrow's goldeneye, Bucephala clangula (R)\u000aHooded merganser, Lophodytes cucullatus\u000aCommon merganser, Mergus merganser\u000aRed-breasted merganser, Mergus serrator\u000aMasked duck, Nomonyx dominicus (R)\u000aRuddy duck, Oxyura jamaicensis\u000a\u000a\u000a== New World quail ==\u000aOrder: Galliformes   Family: Odontophoridae\u000aThe New World quails are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits. One confirmed species and one of questionable origin have been recorded in Maryland.\u000aNorthern bobwhite, Colinus virginianus\u000aCallipepla species, Callipepla sp. (QO)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Pheasants, grouse, and allies ==\u000a\u000aOrder: Galliformes   Family: Phasianidae\u000aPhasianidae consists of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump with broad relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans. Turkeys have a distinctive fleshy wattle that hangs from the underside of the beak and a fleshy protuberance that hangs from the top of its beak called a snood. As with many galliform species, the female (the hen) is smaller and much less colorful than the male (the tom). With wingspans of 1.5\u20131.8 metres (4.9\u20135.9 ft), the turkeys are the largest birds in the open forests in which they live and are rarely mistaken for any other species. Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. In all of Maryland's species, males are polygamous and have elaborate courtship displays. These heavily built birds have legs feathered to the toes. Most species are year-round residents and do not migrate. Four species of Phasianidae have been recorded in Maryland.\u000aRing-necked pheasant, Phasianus colchicus (I)\u000aRuffed grouse, Bonasa umbellus\u000aGreater prairie-chicken, Tympanuchus cupido (E)\u000aWild turkey, Meleagris gallopavo\u000a\u000a\u000a== Flamingoes ==\u000aOrder: Phoenicopteriformes   Family: Phoenicopteridae\u000aFlamingoes are gregarious wading birds, usually 0.91 to 1.5 metres (3.0 to 4.9 ft) in height, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down. One species has been recorded in Maryland.\u000aAmerican flamingo, Phoenicopterus ruber (R)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Grebes ==\u000a\u000aOrder: Podicipediformes   Family: Podicipedidae\u000aGrebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. Five species have been recorded in Maryland.\u000aPied-billed grebe, Podilymbus podiceps\u000aHorned grebe, Podiceps auritus\u000aRed-necked grebe, Podiceps grisegena\u000aEared grebe, Podiceps nigricollis\u000aWestern grebe, Aechmorphorus occidentalis (R)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Pigeons and doves ==\u000a\u000aOrder: Columbiformes   Family: Columbidae\u000aPigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere. Seven species have been recorded in Maryland.\u000aRock pigeon, Columba livia (I)\u000aEurasian collared-dove, Streptopelia decaocto (R) (I)\u000aPassenger pigeon, Ectopistes migratorius (X)\u000aInca dove, Columbina inca (R)\u000aCommon ground-dove, Columbina passerina (R)\u000aWhite-winged dove, Zenaida asiatica (R)\u000aMourning dove, Zenaida macroura\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cuckoos and anis ==\u000a\u000aOrder: Cuculiformes   Family: Cuculidae\u000aThe family Cuculidae includes cuckoos, roadrunners, and anis. These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails, and strong legs. Three species have been recorded in Maryland.\u000aYellow-billed cuckoo, Coccyzus americanus\u000aBlack-billed cuckoo, Coccyzus erythropthalmus\u000aGroove-billed ani, Crotophaga sulcirostris (R)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Nightjars and allies ==\u000a\u000aOrder: Caprimulgiformes   Family: Caprimulgidae\u000aNightjars are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs, and very short bills. Most have small feet that are of little use for walking and long, pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically colored to resemble bark or leaves. Three species have been recorded in Maryland.\u000aCommon nighthawk, Chordeiles minor\u000aChuck-will's-widow, Antrostomus carolinensis\u000aEastern whip-poor-will, Antrostomus vociferus\u000a\u000a\u000a== Swifts ==\u000aOrder: Apodiformes   Family: Apodidae\u000aThe swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. One species has been recorded in Maryland.\u000aChimney swift, Chaetura pelagica\u000a\u000a\u000a== Hummingbirds ==\u000a\u000aOrder: Apodiformes   Family: Trochilidae\u000aHummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards. Six species have been recorded in Maryland.\u000aMexican violetear, Colibri thalassinus (R)\u000aRuby-throated hummingbird, Archilochus colubris\u000aAnna's hummingbird, Calypte anna (R)\u000aRufous hummingbird, Selasphorus rufus\u000aAllen's hummingbird, Selasphorus sasin (R)\u000aCalliope hummingbird, Selasphorus calliope (R)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Rails, gallinules, and coots ==\u000a\u000aOrder: Gruiformes   Family: Rallidae\u000aRallidae is a large family of small- to medium-sized birds that includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes that are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. Ten species have been recorded in Maryland.\u000aYellow rail, Coturnicops noveboracensis (R)\u000aBlack rail, Laterallus jamaicensis (R*)\u000aCorn crake, Crex crex (R)\u000aClapper rail, Rallus crepitans (R*)\u000aKing rail, Rallus elegans\u000aVirginia rail, Rallus limicola\u000aSora, Porzana Carolina\u000aPurple gallinule, Porphyrio martinicus (R)\u000aCommon gallinule, Gallinula galeata\u000aAmerican coot, Fulica americana\u000a\u000a\u000a== Limpkin ==\u000aOrder: Gruiformes   Family: Aramidae\u000aThe Limpkin is a large bird in a monotypic family. It is similar in appearance to the rails, but skeletally it is closer to the cranes. It is found in marshes and gets its common name from its appearance of limping as it walks.\u000aLimpkin, Aramus guarauna (R)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cranes ==\u000aOrder: Gruiformes   Family: Gruidae\u000aCranes are large, long-legged, and long-necked birds. Unlike the similar-looking but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Most have elaborate and noisy courting displays or "dances". One species has been recorded in Maryland.\u000aSandhill crane, Antigone canadensis\u000a\u000a\u000a== Stilts and avocets ==\u000aOrder: Charadriiformes   Family: Recurvirostridae\u000aRecurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds that includes the avocets and stilts. The avocets have long legs and long up-curved bills. The stilts have extremely long legs and long, thin, straight bills. Two species have been recorded in Maryland.\u000aBlack-necked stilt, Himantopus mexicanus (R*)\u000aAmerican avocet, Recurvirostra americana\u000a\u000a\u000a== Oystercatchers ==\u000a\u000aOrder: Charadriiformes   Family: Haematopodidae\u000aThe oystercatchers are large and noisy plover-like birds, with strong bills used for smashing or prying open molluscs. One species has been recorded in Maryland.\u000aAmerican oystercatcher, Haematopus palliatus\u000a\u000a\u000a== Lapwings and plovers ==\u000aOrder: Charadriiformes   Family: Charadriidae\u000aThe family Charadriidae includes the plovers, dotterels, and lapwings. They are small- to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short thick necks, and long, usually pointed, wings. They are usually found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water. Eight confirmed species and one of questionable origin have been recorded in Maryland.\u000aNorthern lapwing, Vanellus vanellus (R)\u000aSouthern lapwing, Vanellus chilensis (QO)\u000aBlack-bellied plover, Pluvialis squatarola\u000aAmerican golden-plover, Pluvialis dominica\u000aSnowy plover, Charadrius nivosus (R)\u000aWilson's plover, Charadrius wilsonia (R)\u000aSemipalmated plover, Charadrius semipalmatus\u000aPiping plover, Charadrius melodus (R*)\u000aKilldeer, Charadrius vociferus\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sandpipers and allies ==\u000a\u000aOrder: Charadriiformes   Family: Scolopacidae\u000aScolopacidae is a large diverse family of small- to medium-sized shorebirds, including the sandpipers, curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers, and phalaropes. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Different lengths of legs and bills enable multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food. Thirty-five species have been recorded in Maryland.\u000aUpland sandpiper, Bartramia longicauda\u000aWhimbrel, Numenius phaeopus (R*)\u000aEskimo curlew, Numenius borealis (X)\u000aLong-billed curlew, Numenius americanus (R)\u000aHudsonian godwit, Limosa haemastica (R*)\u000aMarbled godwit, Limosa fedoa (R*)\u000aRuddy turnstone, Arenaria interpres\u000aRed knot, Calidris canutus\u000aRuff, Calidris pugnax (R*)\u000aStilt sandpiper, Calidris himantopus\u000aCurlew sandpiper, Calidris ferruginea (R)\u000aRed-necked stint, Calidris ruficollis (R)\u000aSanderling, Calidris alba\u000aDunlin, Calidris alpina\u000aPurple sandpiper, Calidris maritima (R*)\u000aBaird's sandpiper, Calidris bairdii\u000aLittle stint, Calidris minuta (R)\u000aLeast sandpiper, Calidris minutilla\u000aWhite-rumped sandpiper, Calidris fuscicollis\u000aBuff-breasted sandpiper, Calidris subruficollis\u000aPectoral sandpiper, Calidris melanotos\u000aSemipalmated sandpiper, Calidris pusilla\u000aWestern sandpiper, Calidris mauri\u000aShort-billed dowitcher, Limnodromus griseus\u000aLong-billed dowitcher, Limnodromus scolopaceus\u000aAmerican woodcock, Scolopax minor\u000aWilson's snipe, Gallinago delicata\u000aSpotted sandpiper, Actitis macularius\u000aSolitary sandpiper, Tringa solitaria\u000aLesser yellowlegs, Tringa flavipes\u000aWillet, Tringa semipalmata\u000aGreater yellowlegs, Tringa melanoleuca\u000aWilson's phalarope, Phalaropus tricolor\u000aRed-necked phalarope, Phalaropus lobatus\u000aRed phalarope, Phalaropus fulicarius (R*)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Skuas and jaegers ==\u000a\u000aOrder: Charadriiformes   Family: Stercorariidae\u000aThe skuas and jaegers are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They have longish bills with hooked tips and webbed feet with sharp claws. They look like large dark gulls, but have a fleshy cere above the upper mandible. They are strong, acrobatic fliers. Five species have been recorded in Maryland.\u000aGreat skua, Stercorarius skua (R)\u000aSouth polar skua, Stercorarius maccormicki (R)\u000aPomarine jaeger, Stercorarius pomarinus (R*)\u000aParasitic jaeger, Stercorarius parasiticus (R*)\u000aLong-tailed jaeger, Stercorarius longicaudus (R)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Auks, murres, and puffins ==\u000aOrder: Charadriiformes   Family: Alcidae\u000aAlcids are superficially similar to penguins due to their black-and-white colors, their upright posture, and some of their habits; however, they are only distantly related to the penguins and are able to fly. Auks live on the open sea, only deliberately coming ashore to nest. Five species and a species pair have been recorded in Maryland.\u000aDovekie, Alle alle (R*)\u000aCommon murre, Uria aalge (R*)\u000aThick-billed murre, Uria lomvia (R)\u000aRazorbill, Alca torda (R*)\u000aBlack guillemot/pigeon guillemot, Cepphus columba/Cepphus grylle (R)\u000aAtlantic puffin, Fratercula arctica (R*)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Gulls, terns, and skimmers ==\u000a\u000aOrder: Charadriiformes   Family: Laridae\u000aGulls are typically medium-to-large birds, usually gray or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small gulls. Terns are in general medium-to-large birds, typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet.

aVThe English Electric P.5 Kingston was a British twin-engined biplane flying boat built by English Electric. When the English Electric Company was formed in 1918 from several companies, the Phoenix Dynamo Manufacturing Company brought with it the two prototype Phoenix P.5 Cork, reconnaissance flying boats. Redesigned, the Cork reappeared as the English Electric P.5 Kingston with a production order for five aircraft.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Design and development ==\u000a\u000aIn 1922 W.O. Manning led a team of designers to produce a coastal patrol and anti-submarine flying boat to meet Air Ministry Specification 23/23. They based the design on the Cork and the resulting aircraft looked similar but the hull was designed to the latest standard. The Kingston also had redesigned wingtip floats, extended upper-wing ailerons, and a larger fin and rudder than the Cork.\u000aIn January 1923 the Air Ministry contracted English Electric to build a prototype and the new design was built at Preston, then moved by road to Lytham for flight trials. Following an inspection by the Ministry on 12 May 1924 the prototype, serial number N168, was launched into the Ribble Estuary on 22 May and after twenty-minutes of trials on the water was taken out into the Estuary for its first flight. At the point of takeoff N168 suddenly stopped "amidst a cloud of spray" and then began to sink. The crew had been thrown out and the aircraft floated with its wings on the surface. While the crew were being rescued the aircraft had floated away and was recovered by a tug which beached N168. The flying-boat was patched up and the water pumped out and by the evening had been refloated using a tug. While being towed by the tug the strong current struck the pier and it had to be beached again, it was recovered to the company slipway the following day. The investigation concluded that the flying-boat had hit some flotsam.\u000aDespite the accident the Air Ministry ordered four more flying-boats to be designated the Kingston Mk. I. The first Kingston I N9709 was ready a few months later, only small changes were made from the prototype including a slightly larger beam and two-bladed propellers. The flying-boat was delivered by rail to the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe in November 1924 for acceptance trials. Although the flying-boat met the type and air-handling requirements it did not meet the Ministries' requirements for seaworthiness. Modifications were made to N9709 for improvements including four-bladed propellers. On 25 May 1925, just after becoming airborne the engines left their mountings and the wing structure failed causing cracks in the hull, the aircraft floated and the crew escaped without injury.\u000aThe second Kingston I N9710 first flew on 13 November 1925 at Lytham and was flown to RAF Calshot for service trials along with the third flying-boat N9711. The fourth flying-boat N9712 was dismantled and the hull moved to RAE Farnborough to enable tests to be carried out.\u000aThis fourth aircraft re-emerged as N9712  at Lytham with a new duralumin hull and became the sole Kingston II. Test-flown at Felixstowe it failed to perform and by 1930 the metal hull was used for tests at Farnborough.\u000aThe last aircraft to be built, N9713, had a completely redesigned hull, but this reverted to wooden construction, and was known as the Kingston III. Although more successful than the others the Kingston III was kept by the MAEE for experimental work and sometimes as a crew ferry. It was intended to produce a metal-hulled variant of the Kingston III but the day the Kingston III left Lytham for Felixstowe in 1926 the company closed its aircraft department.\u000aFollowing some wartime sub-contract work the aircraft department was not reformed until 1944.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Specifications (Kingston I) ==\u000a\u000aData from British Flying Boats\u000aGeneral characteristics\u000aCrew: six (pilot, observer, three gunners, engineer)\u000aLength: 52 ft 9 in (16.08 m)\u000aWingspan: 85 ft 6 in (26.07 m)\u000aHeight: 20 ft 11 in (6.38 m)\u000aWing area: 1,282.5 ft² (119.2 m²)\u000aEmpty weight: 9,130 lb (4,150 kg)\u000aMax. takeoff weight: 14,508 lb (6,595 kg)\u000aPowerplant: 2 × Napier Lion IIIB 12-cylinder piston, 450 hp (336 kW) each\u000aPerformance\u000aMaximum speed: 104.8 mph (91 knots, 169 km/h)\u000aEndurance: 8\u20139 hours\u000aService ceiling: 9,060 ft (2,760 m)\u000aArmament\u000aGuns: 3× 0.303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis machine gun\u000aBombs: Up to 1,040 lb (472 kg) of bombs\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aBoeing XPB\u000aRelated development\u000aFelixstowe F.3\u000aFelixstowe F.5\u000aFairey N.4\u000aAircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\u000aShort Cromarty\u000aVickers Valentia\u000aSupermarine Swan\u000aSupermarine Southampton\u000aNaval Aircraft Factory PN\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000aLondon, Peter (2003).

aVLeonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio (; born November 11, 1974) is an American actor, film producer, and environmental activist. DiCaprio began his career by appearing in television commercials in the late 1980s, after which he had recurring roles in various television series such as the soap opera Santa Barbara and the sitcom Growing Pains. He began his film career by starring as Josh in Critters 3 (1991). He starred in the film adaptation of the memoir This Boy's Life (1993), and was praised for his supporting role in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993). He gained public recognition with leading roles in The Basketball Diaries (1995) and the romantic drama Romeo + Juliet (1996), before achieving international fame with James Cameron's epic romance Titanic (1997), which became the highest-grossing film of all time to that point.\u000aSince 2000, DiCaprio has received critical acclaim for his work in a wide range of film genres. DiCaprio's subsequent films include The Man in the Iron Mask (1998), the biographical crime drama Catch Me If You Can (2002), and the epic historical drama Gangs of New York (2002), which marked his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. He was acclaimed for his performances in the political war thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the neo-noir crime drama The Departed (2006), the espionage thriller Body of Lies (2008), the drama Revolutionary Road (2008), the psychological thriller Shutter Island (2010), the science fiction thriller Inception (2010), the biographical film J. Edgar (2011), the western Django Unchained (2012), and the period drama The Great Gatsby (2013).\u000aDiCaprio's portrayals of Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) and Hugh Glass in The Revenant (2015) won him the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama, and his role as Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) won him the award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. He also won the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for his performance in The Revenant. DiCaprio is the founder of his own production company, Appian Way Productions.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aLeonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born on November 11, 1974, in Los Angeles. He is the only child of Irmelin (née Indenbirken), a legal secretary, and George DiCaprio, an underground comix artist and producer and distributor of comic books. DiCaprio's father is of Italian (from Alife) and German (from Bavaria) descent. DiCaprio's maternal grandfather, Wilhelm Indenbirken, was German. His maternal grandmother, Helene Indenbirken (born Yelena Smirnova; 1915\u20132008), was a Russian-born German citizen. In an interview in Russia, DiCaprio referred to himself as "half-Russian" and said that two of his grandparents were Russian. DiCaprio's parents met while attending college and subsequently moved to Los Angeles, California.\u000aDiCaprio was named Leonardo because his pregnant mother was looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in the Uffizi museum in Florence, Italy, when he first kicked. His parents separated when he was a year old, and he lived mostly with his mother. The two lived in several Los Angeles neighborhoods, such as Echo Park and Los Feliz (his Los Feliz residence was later converted into a public library), while his mother worked several jobs. DiCaprio attended Seeds Elementary School (now UCLA Lab School) and John Marshall High School a few blocks away, after attending the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years. However, he dropped out of high school following his third year, eventually earning his general equivalency diploma (GED). DiCaprio spent part of his childhood in Germany with his maternal grandparents, Wilhelm and Helene. He is conversant in German and Italian.\u000aDiCaprio was also a contestant on the children's game show Fun House. One of the stunts he performed on the show was going fishing in a small pool of water by catching the fish only with his teeth.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Early career ===\u000aDiCaprio's career began with his appearance in several commercials and educational films. After being removed from the set of children's television series Romper Room for being disruptive at the age of five, he followed his older stepbrother Adam Farrar into television commercials, landing an ad for Matchbox cars at 14. In 1990, he got his break on television when he was cast in the short-lived series based on the movie Parenthood. After Parenthood, DiCaprio had bit parts on several shows, including The New Lassie and Roseanne, as well as a brief stint on the soap opera Santa Barbara, playing the young Mason Capwell. His involvement in Parenthood and the daily soap earned him a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor each.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1991\u20131995: Breaking into film ===\u000aDiCaprio's debut film role was in the comedic sci-fi horror film Critters 3, in which he played the stepson of an evil landlord, a role that DiCaprio described as "your average, no-depth, standard kid with blond hair." Released in 1991, the movie went direct-to-video. Soon after, he became a recurring cast member on the ABC sitcom Growing Pains, playing Luke Brower, a homeless boy who is taken in by the Seaver family. DiCaprio made his big screen breakthrough in 1992, when he was handpicked by Robert De Niro out of 400 young actors to play the lead role in This Boy's Life.\u000aLater in 1993, DiCaprio co-starred as the mentally handicapped brother of Johnny Depp's character in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, a comic-tragic odyssey of a dysfunctional Iowa family. Director Lasse Hallström admitted he was initially looking for a less good-looking actor but finally settled on DiCaprio as he had emerged as "the most observant actor" among all auditionees. Budgeted at US$11 million, the film became a critical success, resulting in various accolades for DiCaprio, who was awarded the National Board of Review Award and nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for his portrayal. New York Times critic Janet Maslin praised DiCaprio's performance, writing "the film's real show-stopping turn comes from Mr. DiCaprio, who makes Arnie's many tics so startling and vivid that at first he is difficult to watch. The performance has a sharp, desperate intensity from beginning to end."\u000aDiCaprio's first effort of 1995 was Sam Raimi's The Quick and the Dead, a western film. Sony Pictures was dubious over DiCaprio's casting, and as a result, co-star Sharon Stone decided to pay the actor's salary herself. The film was released to a dismal box office performance, barely grossing US$18.5 million in the US, and received mixed reviews from critics. DiCaprio next starred in Total Eclipse, a fictionalized account of the homosexual relationship between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. He replaced River Phoenix, who died during pre-production on the project. A minor art-house success, the film grossed US$0.34 million throughout its domestic theatrical run.\u000aDiCaprio appeared in the mostly improvised short film called Don's Plum, as a favor to aspiring director R. D. Robb. When Robb decided to expand the black-and-white film to feature length, however, DiCaprio and costar Tobey Maguire had its release blocked by court order, arguing that they never intended to make it a theatrical release, as it would have commercial value thanks to their stardom. The film eventually premiered at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival, where it was well received by critics. DiCaprio's last film of the year 1995 was The Basketball Diaries, a biographical film about Jim Carroll.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1996\u20132001: Mainstream success ===\u000aIn 1996, DiCaprio appeared opposite Claire Danes in Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet, an abridged modernization of William Shakespeare's romantic tragedy of the same name, which retained the original Shakespearean dialogue. The project achieved a worldwide box office take of $147 million.\u000aLater that year, he starred in Jerry Zaks' family drama Marvin's Room, reuniting with Robert De Niro. Based on Scott McPherson's screenplay adaptation of his own 1991 stage play of the same name, the film revolves around two sisters, played by Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton, who are reunited through tragedy after 17 years of estrangement. DiCaprio portrayed Hank, Streep's character's troubled son, who has been committed to a mental asylum for setting fire to his mother's house.\u000a\u000aIn 1997, DiCaprio starred in James Cameron's Titanic (1997) as twenty-year-old Jack Dawson, a penniless Wisconsin man who wins two tickets for the third-class on the ill-fated RMS Titanic. DiCaprio initially refused to portray the character but was eventually encouraged to pursue the role by Cameron, who strongly believed in his acting ability. Against expectations, the film went on to become the highest-grossing film to date (it was surpassed in 2010 by Cameron's film Avatar), grossing more than $1.843 billion in box-office receipts worldwide, and transformed DiCaprio into a commercial movie superstar, resulting in fan worship among teenage girls and young women in general that became known as "Leo-Mania". In May 1998, for example, his face appeared on the covers of at least four teen magazines, and three books about DiCaprio were among the top six paperbacks on The New York Times Best Seller list. More than 200 fans contacted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to protest his not being nominated for the 70th Academy Awards. He was nominated for other high-profile awards, including a second Golden Globe nomination. Upon the success of Titanic, DiCaprio stated in 2000: "I have no connection with me during that whole Titanic phenomenon and what my face became around the world [...] I'll never reach that state of popularity again, and I don't expect to. It's not something I'm going to try to achieve either."\u000aThe following year, DiCaprio made a self-mocking cameo appearance in Woody Allen's caustic satire of the fame industry, Celebrity (1998). That year, he also starred in the dual roles of the villainous King Louis XIV and his secret, sympathetic twin brother Philippe in Randall Wallace's The Man in the Iron Mask, based on the same-titled 1939 film. Despite receiving a rather mixed to negative response, the film became a box office success, grossing US$180 million internationally. Though DiCaprio's performance was generally well-received, with Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman writing that "the shockingly androgynous DiCaprio looks barely old enough to be playing anyone with hormones, but he's a fluid and instinctive actor, with the face of a mischievous angel," he was awarded a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Couple for both incarnations the following year.\u000aDiCaprio's next project was the drama film The Beach (2000), an adaption of Alex Garland's 1996 novel of the same name. He played an American backpacking tourist looking for the perfect way of life in a secret island commune in the Gulf of Thailand. Budgeted at $US50 million, the film became a financial success, grossing $US144 million worldwide, but as with DiCaprio's previous project, the film was negatively reviewed by critics. Todd McCarthy of Variety noted that "Richard [DiCaprio's role] is too much the American Everyman and not enough of a well-defined individual to entirely capture one's interest and imagination, and DiCaprio, while perfectly watchable, does not endow him with the quirks or distinguishing marks to make this man from nowhere a dimensional character." The next year, he was nominated for another Razzie Award for his work on the film.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2002\u20132007 ===\u000a\u000aDiCaprio's first film of 2002 was the biographical crime drama film Catch Me If You Can, based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, used his charm, confidence, and several different personas, to make millions in the 1960s writing bad checks. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film was shot in 147 different locations in only 52 days, making it "the most adventurous, super-charged movie-making" DiCaprio had experienced yet. Catch Me If You Can received favorable reviews and proved to be an international success, becoming DiCaprio's highest-grossing film since Titanic with a total of US$351.1 million worldwide. Roger Ebert praised his performance, and noted that while "DiCaprio, who in recent films [...] has played dark and troubled characters, is breezy and charming here, playing a boy who discovers what he is good at, and does it." The following year, DiCaprio received his third Golden Globe nomination for his work in the film.\u000aAlso in 2002, DiCaprio appeared in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York, a historical film set in the mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City. Director Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader of the Irish faction, and thus, Miramax Films got involved with financing the project. Nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in a marathon eight-month shoot and, at US$103 million, the most expensive film Scorsese had ever made. Upon its release, Gangs of New York became a financial and critical success. DiCaprio's acting was well-received but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis' performance among most critics.\u000a\u000aForging a collaboration with Scorsese, the two paired again for a biopic of the eccentric and obsessive American film director and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004). Centering on Hughes' life from the late 1920s to 1947, DiCaprio initially developed the project with Michael Mann, who decided against directing it after back-to-back film biographies in Ali and The Insider. The actor eventually pitched John Logan's script to Scorsese, who quickly signed on to direct. The Aviator became a critical and financial success. DiCaprio received rave reviews for his performance and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, also receiving another Academy Award nomination.\u000aIn 2005, DiCaprio was made a commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture for his contributions to the arts. The following year, the actor starred in both Blood Diamond and The Departed. In Edward Zwick's war film Blood Diamond, he starred as a diamond smuggler from Rhodesia who is involved in the Sierra Leone Civil War. The film itself received generally favorable reviews, and DiCaprio was praised for the authenticity of his South African Afrikaner accent, known as a difficult accent to imitate. In Scorsese's The Departed he played the role of Billy Costigan, a state trooper working undercover in an Irish Mob in Boston. Highly anticipated, the film was released to overwhelmingly positive reviews and became one of the highest-rated wide release films of 2006. Budgeted at US$90 million, it also emerged as DiCaprio and Scorsese's highest-grossing collaboration to date, easily beating The Aviator´s previous record of US$213.7 million. DiCaprio's performance in The Departed was applauded by critics and earned him a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor. The same year, both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild nominated DiCaprio twice in the Best Actor category for both of his 2006 features, and in addition, DiCaprio earned his third Academy Award nomination for Blood Diamond.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2008\u20132012 ===\u000aIn 2008, DiCaprio starred in Body of Lies, a spy film based on the novel of the same name by David Ignatius, set in context of the Middle East and the War on Terror, telling the story of three men battling a terrorist organization, and each other. Directed by Ridley Scott, DiCaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown contacts for the role, which he chose to pursue because he considered it a throwback to political films of the 1970s such as The Parallax View (1974) and Three Days of the Condor (1975). The film received mixed reviews from critics, and at a budget of US$67.5 million, became a moderate box office success, grossing US$115 million worldwide.\u000a\u000aThe same year, DiCaprio reunited with Kate Winslet to film the drama Revolutionary Road (2008), directed by Winslet's then-husband Sam Mendes. As both actors had been reluctant to make romantic films similar to Titanic, it was Winslet who suggested that both should work with her on a film adaptation of the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates after reading the script by Justin Haythe, knowing that plot had little in common with the 1997 blockbuster. Once DiCaprio agreed to do the film, it went almost immediately into production. He noted that he saw his character as "unheroic" and "slightly cowardly" and that he was "willing to be just a product of his environment." Portraying a couple in a failing marriage in the 1950s, DiCaprio and Winslet watched period videos promoting life in the suburbs to prepare themselves for Revolutionary Road, which eventually earned them favorable reviews. For his portrayal DiCaprio garnered his seventh Golden Globes nomination.\u000aDiCaprio continued his collaborative streak with Scorsese in the 2010 psychological thriller film Shutter Island (2010), based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. He played U.S. Marshal Edward "Teddy" Daniels, who is investigating a psychiatric facility located on an island and comes to question his own sanity. The film grossed $294 million.\u000aAlso in 2010, DiCaprio starred in director Christopher Nolan's science-fiction film Inception, also starring Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger and Michael Caine. Inspired by the experience of lucid dreaming and dream incubation, DiCaprio portrays the character of Dom Cobb, an "extractor" who enters the dreams of others to obtain information that is otherwise inaccessible. Cobb is promised a chance to regain his old life in exchange for planting an idea in a corporate target's mind. DiCaprio was "intrigued by this concept \u2014 this dream-heist notion and how this character's gonna unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life." Released to critical acclaim, the film grossed over $825 million worldwide. To star in this film, DiCaprio agreed to a pay cut from his $20 million fee, in favor of splitting first-dollar gross points, which means he receives money coming directly off the top of ticket sales. This risk paid off, with DiCaprio earning $50 million from the film to become his highest payday yet. The movie went on to become Di Caprio's second highest-grossing movie with $293 million at the box office, after Titanic with $659 million and ahead of The Revenant with $184 million.\u000aIn July 2010, it was announced that DiCaprio had pulled out of a Viking movie to be directed by Mel Gibson amid controversy over Gibson's rage-fueled rant tapes and domestic violence probe.\u000a\u000aIn 2011, DiCaprio starred alongside Armie Hammer and Naomi Watts in Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar, a biopic about J. Edgar Hoover. Written by Dustin Lance Black, the film focuses on the career of the FBI director from the Palmer Raids onwards, including an examination of his private life as an alleged closeted homosexual. Reviews towards the film were mostly mixed, with many critics commending DiCaprio's performance but feeling that, overall, the film lacked coherence. Roger Ebert praised DiCaprio's performance as a "fully-realized, subtle and persuasive performance, hinting at more than Hoover ever revealed, perhaps even to himself."\u000aIn 2012, DiCaprio starred as villainous Calvin Candie in Quentin Tarantino's spaghetti western, Django Unchained. While filming Django Unchained, DiCaprio accidentally cut his hand on glass, but continued filming despite the injury, and Tarantino elected to use the take in the final movie. The film received positive reviews from critics and earned DiCaprio his ninth nomination from the Golden Globes. Django Unchained grossed $424 million worldwide.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2013\u2013present ===\u000a\u000aDiCaprio's next film was The Great Gatsby, again with Baz Luhrmann (who directed him in Romeo + Juliet in 1996), an adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel, also starring Carey Mulligan and Tobey Maguire; the film was released on May 10, 2013. It received mixed reviews from critics, however DiCaprio's portrayal as Jay Gatsby was praised. Critic Rafer Guzman of Newsday praised DiCaprio by stating, "As for Leonardo DiCaprio, he is now the Gatsby to beat. Despite a borderline comedic entrance \u2013 haloed by fireworks and accompanied by Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue"\u2014DiCaprio nails this maddeningly enigmatic character. He's as tough as Alan Ladd in '49, as suave as Redford in '74, but also vulnerable, touching, funny, a faker, a human. You hear it all in Gatsby's favorite phrase, "old sport," a verbal tic that stumped other actors. It's a tremendous, hard-won performance." Matt Zoller Seitz of Roger Ebert.com described his performance as Gatsby as "The movie's greatest and simplest special effect," and states "This is an iconic performance \u2014 maybe his career best." The film grossed $348 million worldwide and became Luhrmann's highest-grossing film.\u000aDiCaprio reunited with Scorsese for the fifth time in The Wolf of Wall Street, a film based on the life of stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who was arrested in the late 1990s for securities fraud and money laundering. Filming began on August 8, 2012, in New York, and the film was released on December 25, 2013. The role earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy and his fourth Academy Award nomination for acting. In January 2013, DiCaprio said he was going to take a long break from acting and would "fly around the world doing good for the environment."\u000aIn 2015, DiCaprio played fur trapper Hugh Glass in the survival drama The Revenant, directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu. The film was well received by critics and DiCaprio's performance garnered universal acclaim that earned him numerous awards, including his first win at the Academy Awards in the Best Actor category, his eleventh nomination and third win at Golden Globes in the Best Actor Drama category, and his first BAFTA award for Best Actor.\u000aOn August 10, 2015, it was announced that Martin Scorsese will direct an adaptation of Erik Larson's The Devil in the White City, which will star DiCaprio with a screenplay to be written by Billy Ray. In October 2015, Appian Way acquired the movie rights for a book about the Volkswagen emissions scandal. On October 21, 2016, it was announced that DiCaprio will portray Sam Phillips, founder of Memphis-based Sun Studio, in the forthcoming film based on Peter Guralnick's book Sam Phillips: The Man Who Invented Rock \u2018N\u2019 Roll. In 2017, Paramount announced that it has acquired the movie rights for an English language adaptation of The Black Hand. The new film, due for release in 2018, will star DiCaprio as Joe Petrosino, and will be partly based on Stephan Talty's novelization of Petrosino's assassination. In August 2017, Paramount won a bidding war against Universal Pictures for the rights to adapt Walter Isaacson's biography of Leonardo da Vinci. The studio bought the rights under its deal with DiCaprio's Appian Way Productions, which said that it planned to produce the film with DiCaprio as the star. As of September 2017, DiCaprio is set to star in Roosevelt, a biopic of former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt; Martin Scorsese will direct and Paramount Pictures will distribute, with DiCaprio's Appian Way producing. The film does not yet have a release date. In January 2018, it was announced that DiCaprio is planned to star in Quentin Tarantino's upcoming film about the Manson Family murders.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aDiCaprio's romantic relationships have been widely covered in the media. In 1997 DiCaprio dated the British singer Emma Bunton. He also dated the actress Bijou Phillips and the models Kristen Zang and Emma Miller. In 2000, he met Brazilian model Gisele Bündchen, whom he dated until 2005. He was romantically involved with Israeli model Bar Refaeli from 2005 to 2011, during which time he met with Israeli president Shimon Peres and visited Refaeli's hometown of Hod HaSharon.\u000aDiCaprio owns a home in Los Angeles and an apartment in Battery Park City, New York. In 2009, he bought an island off mainland Belize, on which he is planning to create an eco-friendly resort. In 2014, he purchased the original Dinah Shore residence designed by mid-century modern architect Donald Wexler in Palm Springs, California.\u000aIn 2005, DiCaprio's face was severely injured when model Aretha Wilson hit him over the head with a broken bottle at a Hollywood party. After pleading guilty in 2010, Wilson was sentenced to prison for two years.\u000aDuring the 2004 presidential election, DiCaprio campaigned and donated to John Kerry's presidential bid. The FEC showed that DiCaprio gave $2,300 to Barack Obama's presidential campaign in the 2008 election, the maximum contribution an individual could give in that election cycle, and $5,000 to Obama's 2012 campaign.\u000aDiCaprio is agnostic.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other work ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Environmental activism ===\u000aFollowing the success of Titanic in 1997 along with earlier films, 24-year-old DiCaprio established the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation in 1998, a non-profit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness. Although concerned with all areas of the environment, it focuses on global warming, preserving Earth's biodiversity and supporting renewable energy. It has worked on projects in over 40 countries and has produced two short web documentaries, Water Planet and Global Warning. The foundation has also funded debt-for-nature swaps.\u000aBecause of his active involvement in those causes, he has received praise from environmental groups. Among the accolades received were the Martin Litton Environment Award, in 2001, from Environment Now, and the Environmental Leadership Award in 2003 from Global Green USA.\u000aDiCaprio chaired the national Earth Day celebration in 2000, where he interviewed President Bill Clinton and they discussed plans to deal with global warming and the environment. In 2007 he had a major role in The 11th Hour, a documentary about people's relationship to nature and global warming. He co-produced, co-wrote and narrated the film. From a benefit "11th Hour" fine art auction he organized in 2013, he raised nearly $40 million to toward his foundation. He told attendees, "Bid as if the fate of the planet depended on us." It became the world's highest-grossing environmental charity event ever held. DiCaprio states that global warming is the world's "number-one environmental challenge".\u000aIn July 2016 his foundation awarded $15.6 million to help protect wildlife and the rights of Native Americans, along with combating climate change. And in July 2017, a charity auction and celebrity concert put on by the foundation had raised over $30 million in its opening days and was set to continue the following month.\u000a\u000aHe has been an active supporter of numerous environmental organizations and has sat on the board of the World Wildlife Fund, Global Green USA, International Fund for Animal Welfare and the Natural Resources Defense Council. He traveled to Indonesia in early 2016 where he criticized the government's palm oil industry's slash-and-burn forest clearing methods.\u000aAt the 2007 Oscar ceremony, DiCaprio and former Vice President Al Gore appeared to announce that the Academy Awards had incorporated environmentally intelligent practices in its production. He presented at the 2007 American leg of Live Earth, and in 2010 his environmental work earned DiCaprio a nomination for the VH1 Do Something Award, honoring people who do good. In 2014 he was appointed as a United Nations representative on climate change, and later that year he made an opening statement to members of the UN Climate Summit. He again spoke at the UN in April 2016 prior to the signing of Paris Climate Change Agreement.\u000aDiCaprio is a vegetarian, rumored to even be vegan, and in 2014 he backed the documentary Cowspiracy about the impact of animal agriculture on the environment and the positions of several environmental organizations on the issue. By taking the role of executive producer, DiCaprio helped the documentary get released on Netflix.\u000aHe also executive-produced and appeared in Before the Flood, a 2016 documentary film examining various aspects of global warming.\u000aIn accepting his Best Actor award at the 2016 Oscars ceremony, DiCaprio stated:\u000a\u000aClimate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters, but who speak for all of humanity, for the indigenous people of the world, for the billions and billions of underprivileged people out there who would be most affected by this. For our children\u2019s children, and for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed.\u000a\u000aDiCaprio has owned environment-friendly electric-hybrid vehicles and his home is powered by solar panels, although his use of private jets and large yachts has attracted criticism due to their large carbon footprints.\u000aIn November 2010, DiCaprio donated $1 million to the Wildlife Conservation Society at Russia's tiger summit. DiCaprio's persistence in reaching the event after encountering two plane delays caused then Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to describe him as a "muzhik" or "real man". In 2011, DiCaprio joined the Animal Legal Defense Fund's campaign to free Tony, a tiger who has spent the last decade at the Tiger Truck Stop in Grosse Tête, Louisiana.\u000aIn early 2016, at a meeting with Pope Francis, he gave a charity donation and spoke about environmental issues. A few days later, possibly influenced by his meeting with DiCaprio, the Pope said he would act in a planned faith-based charity film, Beyond the Sun. It would be his first acting experience, and would also be the first time in history that a Pope appeared in a feature film. Profits from the film would be given to charities in Argentina.\u000aIn October 2016, DiCaprio joined forces with Mark Ruffalo in North Dakota in support of the Standing Rock tribe\u2019s opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline.\u000aIn April 2017, he promoted and protested President Trump's inaction on climate change by attending the 2017 People's Climate March.Leonardo DiCaprio is identified as one of the most active celebrities in the climate change movement. Not only did he highlight the topic at the Oscars but he is a constant source of information on the matter.Many political figures welcome high-profile influencers such as actors as Leonardo DiCaprio or artists to address political causes, environmental or not, \u201cbecause of the high recognition that celebrities have\u201d, states Eric T. Kasper, an associate professor of political science. He claims that much of the public feel a personal connection to the stars after experiencing emotion from them in so many different ways on the big screens. While budgets in the science and technology sector are declining as well as interest in newspapers and scientific journal series, it is important to have more familiar faces and voices such of those from celebrities to represent the importance of subjects such as climate change.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Philanthropy ===\u000a\u000aIn 1998, DiCaprio and his mother donated $35,000 for a "Leonardo DiCaprio Computer Center" at the Los Feliz branch of the Los Angeles Public Library, the site of his childhood home. It was rebuilt after the 1994 Northridge earthquake and opened in early 1999. During the filming of Blood Diamond, DiCaprio worked with 24 orphaned children from the SOS Children's Village in Maputo, Mozambique, and was said to be extremely touched by his interactions with the children. In 2010, he donated $1 million to relief efforts in Haiti after the earthquake.\u000aIn April 2013, DiCaprio donated $61,000 to GLAAD, an organization which promotes the image of LGBT people in the media.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Filmography and accolades ==\u000aLeonardo DiCaprio filmography\u000aList of awards and nominations received by Leonardo DiCaprio\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a\u000aLeonardo DiCaprio Foundation\u000aLeonardo DiCaprio on IMDb\u000aLeonardo DiCaprio at Box Office Mojo\u000aLeonardo DiCaprio at Rotten Tomatoes

aVVrlika is a small town and municipality in inland Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia. The closest large towns are Sinj, Knin, and Drni\u0161. Vrlika was given the status of city in 1997.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Location ==\u000aVrlika is located in the Cetinska Krajina region in Split-Dalmatia County. It is 40 km northwest of the town of Sinj on the State route D1 between the towns of Sinj and Knin and on the regional route which connects Vrlika with Drni\u0161.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aThe oldest evidence for human life in this region is from 30,000 BC. During the Bronze Age, between 1900-1600 BC, there was the so-called Cetina culture on the territory of Vrlika municipality. Archaeologists have found ancient graves, a Bronze Age sword and other smaller stuff dating back to that period. These findings made it clear that in the past this land was densely populated. Prior to the arrival of the Romans, the Illyrian tribe of Dalmatae are said to have inhabited the region. After multiple wars, lasting for as long as 250 years, in the year 9 AD they were finally defeated and annexed by the Romans.\u000aThe history of the town begins in the 7th century when the Croats moved there and formed a village on the spring of the river Cetina, in a field below the mountain Dinara. In the 9th century probably during the time of Duke Branimir of Croatia, the old Croatian Catholic Church of Holy Salvation "Crkva Sv. Spasa" was built near Vrlika, then called Vrh Rike. Church was built by old Croatian Gostiha of Cetina "Cetinski \u017eupan Gastika" in memory of his mother and his sons.\u000aVrlika was first mentioned in written sources in 1069, as the seat of Cetin County (Cetinska \u017eupanija) - the old Croatian county, which included the towns of: Glava\u0161, Prozor, Sinj, Trilj, Stolac, Gradac, Nutjak, Tugare and Poljic parish (Polji\u010dka \u017eupa). Of the five old Croatian counties (Imotska, Zminjska, Kli\u0161ka i Dridska) that were located in the area of the current Split-Dalmatia County, Cetinska County was the largest.\u000aIn the year 1406 King Ladislaus of Naples gives Prozor Fortress, at that time Castrum Werhlychky as a center of Vrli\u010dka \u017eupa, to the Croatian noble Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107. During the medieval period Vrlika, along with the rest of the Balkans, experienced invasion and subsequent occupation by the Ottoman Empire. During the Ottoman rule the local population of Vrlika was forced to convert to Islam or leave. Many of the original settlers from Vrlika left for the island Olib in the Adriatic Sea off the Croatian coast.\u000aIn the late 17th century, the town was liberated from the Ottomans by the Republic of Venice as a result of the Morean War. Locally, the uprising against the Ottomans was led by Croatian priest Father Josip Bogi\u0107. During French rule (1805\u20131814), Vrlika became a municipality in the \u0160ibenik district. Franz Joseph I of Austria visited Vrlika in 1875 and noted impressions in his diary.\u000aThe town was part of the Republic of Serbian Krajina on August 26, 1991. Soon after, the non-Serb population was expelled from the area. The Serbs had deliberately attacked medical facilities, including the centre for retarded children who had remained for several months without water, electricity or adequate medical supplies.

In modern times tourism, hospitality, and information technology are also substantial, with a focus on the principles of sustainable development.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Religion in Vrlika ==\u000aChurch of Sveti Spas (9th century)\u000aBuilt during the reign of Croatian duke Branimir in the 9th century, by \u017eupan Gostiha of Cetina, near Vrlika, then called Vrh Rike. This church is one of the most important in Croatia, as it is the only pre-schism church constructed with a bell tower that is still standing [1]. 1,026 Old-Croatian ancient graves of great archaeological interest have been found in the vicinity of the church indicating that the culture of that time was under the influence of the Frankish Empire.\u000a\u000aMonastery Dragovi\u0107 (1395)\u000a\u000aThe Dragovi\u0107 monastery was founded in 1395 while Vrlika was ruled by Croatian noble Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 from Bosnia. In 1480 the Ottoman Turks invaded the region, raided the monastery, and expelled its residents. For twenty full years it was abandoned until restored. Dragovi\u0107 monastery is situated on a hill downstream of the Cetina River not far from Vrlika. Its location was shifted several times due to wars and the construction of a dam on Cetina River\u000aOrthodox church (1618)\u000a\u000aIn 1618, the Orthodox church dedicated to Saint Nicholas was built by the Serb Orthodox inhabitants in and around Vrlika, where it still stands today.\u000aRoman Catholic Parish Church (1898)\u000a\u000aFather Jure Bogi\u0107 from Cetina established a Catholic parish of Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1688, and later Our Lady of the Rosary. The Roman Catholic parish church in Vrlika dedicated to the Nativity of the Virgin Mary (Croatian: \u017dupna crkva Gospe Ru\u017earice) was built from the year 1876 to 1898. The church was built on the site of a mosque, which was built on the foundations of an old Catholic church. This simple stone church dominates the Vrlika centre square. During the Second World War, the Catholic church in Vrlika sustained significant damage. In the front of the church stands a bronze bust dedicated to Filip Grabovac, who was born in the nearby village of Vinali\u0107 and died in Venice, Italy as a Croatian national hero. The exterior dimensions of the parish church are 27x10.30 metres. The Catholic Parish Church in Vrlika was badly damaged and desecrated during the recent Croatian War of Independence. The holy day of Gospe Ru\u017earice, the protector of the Vrlika Catholic community, is celebrated annually during the first week of October.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notable people ==\u000aFilip Grabovac (1698\u20131749) - Franciscan priest and writer\u000aMilan Begovi\u0107 (1876\u20131948) - writer\u000aAnte Kuduz - academic painter\u000aPetar Bari\u0161i\u0107 - academic sculptor\u000a\u000a\u000a== Villages of the Vrlika municipality ==\u000aGarjak, Je\u017eevi\u0107, Koljane, Kosore, Maovice, Oti\u0161i\u0107, Podosoje, Vinali\u0107\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial site (in Croatian)

aVThe Sons of Katie Elder is a 1965 Technicolor Western Panavision film directed by Henry Hathaway and starring John Wayne and Dean Martin. It was filmed principally in Mexico.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000aThe four adult sons of Katie Elder \u2013 John (John Wayne), who is a famous (or infamous) professional gunman; Tom (Dean Martin), a professional gambler; Bud (Michael Anderson, Jr.), the youngest brother, still in school; and Matt (Earl Holliman), an unsuccessful hardware dealer \u2013 reunite in their hometown of Clearwater, Texas (approximately 2 hours east of Dallas, Texas), in 1898 for their mother's funeral, sharing regret that none of them has lived up to her high expectations of them.\u000aThe townspeople are unfriendly, to John and Tom in particular. Katie Elder was extremely well liked by everyone in the community, who were all aware of her honesty, her poverty and her undying love for the sons who neglected her. The brothers want to do something for Katie's sake, and their plan is to send youngest son Bud to college, raising money through a sale of another man's herd of horses, even though Bud wants to emulate his eldest brother.\u000aMorgan Hastings (James Gregory), a gunsmith and rising entrepreneur, claims ownership of the Elders' ranch, saying he won it from their father in a game of cards; Bass Elder afterwards was shot in the back, and the killer is still unknown. Hastings hides a hostile attitude towards the brothers and brings in a hired gun, Curley (George Kennedy). Noting Hasting's attitude, the Elders begin to suspect foul play. Hastings claims Bass lost the ranch in a game of Blackjack, so John, in a ruse, states their father wouldn't have been caught dead playing Blackjack.\u000aWhen Hastings learns about the brothers' investigations, he kills the sheriff (Paul Fix) and frames the Elder brothers for the murder. Then, not content with seeing them go to prison, Hastings arranges an ambush in which Matt is killed and Bud seriously injured. Deputy Ben Latta (Jeremy Slate) is not part of the conspiracy, but is shot and killed by Hastings when he decides to aid the Elders. The surviving Elders escape, and going back to town to get medical help for Bud, John and Tom barricade themselves in the smithy. Tom manages to kidnap Hasting's weak-willed son Dave (Dennis Hopper), although he is seriously injured in the process. Hastings shoots his own boy in an attempt to prevent him from testifying. In the presence of John Elder and the local judge, a wounded Dave manages to relate the tale of his father's crimes before he dies. John takes up arms and kills Hastings by shooting up a cask of gunpowder inside his own gun store.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cast ==\u000aJohn Wayne as John Elder\u000aDean Martin as Tom Elder\u000aMartha Hyer as Mary Gordon\u000aMichael Anderson Jr. as Bud Elder\u000aEarl Holliman as Matt Elder\u000aJeremy Slate as Ben Latta\u000aJames Gregory as Morgan Hastings\u000aPaul Fix as Sheriff Billy Wilson\u000aGeorge Kennedy as Curley\u000aDennis Hopper as Dave Hastings\u000aSheldon Allman as Harry Evers\u000aJohn Litel as Minister\u000aJohn Doucette as Hyselman\u000aJames Westerfield as Mr. Vennar\u000aRhys Williams as Charlie Striker\u000aJohn Qualen as Charlie Biller\u000aRodolfo Acosta as Bondie Adams\u000aStrother Martin as Jeb Ross\u000aPercy Helton as Mr. Peevey\u000aKarl Swenson as Doc Isdell\u000a\u000a\u000a== Screenplay ==\u000aWilliam H. Wright picked up a copy of Life of the Marlows in a Los Angeles, California, bookstore in around 1953. Thinking that it would make the basis of a good Western, he paid members of the Marlow family $1,000 (about $9146.77 when adjusted for inflation) each for the rights to make it into a screenplay. But when the movie was made 12 years later, the film's plot had been drastically changed.\u000aTalbot Jennings was credited for the script.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Development ==\u000aParamount purchased the story by William Wright and Talbot Jennings in 1955. The story concerned five brothers and centered around a cattle drive from Texas to Colorado. Sam Briskin was assigned as producer. Frank Burt was to write the script, John Sturges was going to direct and Alan Ladd was to star, making a return to Paramount after several years' absence - he still owed Paramount one film left.\u000aNoel Langley signed to write a version of the script, and filming was to start in April 1956. However, in July 1956 it was announced that Ladd had bought himself out of his Paramount commitment by paying $135,000, and he would no longer make the film. (Henry Hathaway put this figure at $250,000.)\u000aFilm rights were picked up by Hal Wallis, who had a deal with Paramount. In 1959 it was announced that Dean Martin would star. John Sturges was still attached as director. Eventually in 1964 John Wayne was signed to star, with Henry Hathaway to direct.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Shooting ==\u000aFilming was due to begin in September 1964, but had to be delayed until January 1965, after Wayne was diagnosed with lung cancer. Following Wayne's surgery to remove a cancerous lung and two ribs, the star insisted on doing his own stunts, and nearly contracted pneumonia after being dragged into a river.\u000aOutdoor locations were filmed in Durango, Mexico, and on the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, Colorado, United States.\u000aTommy Kirk was signed for the film, presumably in the role of Bud Elder, but his arrest for being at a party where marijuana was used led to his being fired from the production.\u000aThe name "Kate Elder" was one of several names used by Mary Katherine Horony Cummings, better known as "Big Nose Kate," a western icon and sometime companion of Doc Holliday.\u000aJohn Wayne and Dean Martin had also starred in Howard Hawks's Rio Bravo six years earlier, one of Martin's earliest dramatic roles after splitting with his partner Jerry Lewis.\u000aFour years later, Henry Hathaway also directed John Wayne in his Academy Award-winning role of Rooster Cogburn in the original screen version of True Grit. In addition to Wayne, actors Strother Martin, Dennis Hopper, and Jeremy Slate were in that film as well.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Song ==\u000aJohnny Cash sang a song in 1965 also called "The Sons of Katie Elder", written by Elmer Bernstein and Ernie Sheldon. The film's background music was also composed by Elmer Bernstein.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Legacy ==\u000aThe 2005 film Four Brothers was loosely based on The Sons of Katie Elder.\u000aThe Malayalam film Big B (2007) is a remake of Four Brothers.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Historical basis ==\u000aThe film was roughly based on the 1888 true story of the five Marlow Brothers (George H., Boone, Alfred, Lewellyn, and Charles) of Graham, Texas, in Young County, and Marlow, Oklahoma.\u000aThe city of Marlow, Oklahoma, is named after the Marlow family, including their parents, Dr. Wilburn Williamson Marlow, Sr., and Martha Jane (née Keaton) Marlow. Dr. Marlow was the town's first physician and a prominent citizen. Marlow had previously been a Chisholm Trail rest spot near Wild Horse Creek. There the Marlows built a dugout home called "Marlow Camp" in 1880. Ten years later, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad came through and built a station on the location, naming it Marlow.\u000aDr. Wilburn and Martha Marlow had four children in addition to the five brothers: Wilburn Williamson "Willie" Marlow, Jr. (died in Leadville, Colorado, in 1879, where he had been taken to convalesce after contracting malaria in Mexico), Charlotte Murphy, Elizabeth "Eliza" Gilmore, and Nancy Jane "Nannie" Murphy. Dr. Marlow died April 12, 1885.\u000aThree of the brothers (Boone, Alfred, and Lewellyn) ended up being killed, although in the film, the brother that had done the real killings (basis for the Dean Martin role) was not with the other four when they were first arrested.\u000aBoone had earlier killed James Holstein (or Holdson or Holston) in 1882, a man allegedly hired to "intimidate settlers," after an inebriated Holdson began shooting at him on the Gilmore farm near Vernon, Texas, just across the Red River from Indian territory (his sister Elizabeth had married into the Gilmore family and the couple had set up a place there). This killing seemed to be justified in self-defense, but would be brought up later by John and William Murphy, deputy marshal Edward W. "Ed" Johnson, and Sam Criswell, who were having a personal feud with Boone, and would be witnesses against the brothers.\u000aBoone, Alfred (aka Alf), Lewellyn (aka Epp, Ep, Ellie), and Charles were arrested near the Anadarko Agency headquarters (what became Anadarko, Oklahoma), for stealing 19 horses in the area around Fort Sill. George went to the homestead in Marlow and took the women by wagon to Graham where he was then also arrested. Martha Jane bailed them out and they went to their place in Young County, a log and clapboard building on the farm of O. G. Denson, fifteen miles southeast of Graham.\u000aPopular sheriff Marion DeKalb Wallace and his deputy Thomas B. "Tom" Collier went out to the Denson farm, December 17, 1888. Before they left Graham they had been drinking and were intoxicated. The Marlows (Charles and his wife, Alfred's wife, Martha, Lewellyn, and Boone Marlow) were sitting down to noon dinner. Boone saw Collier through the window and invited him in for dinner, to which Collier replied, "I'm not hungry." An altercation broke out between Collier and Boone, and without showing their warrant, Collier fired at Boone. As Wallace heard the commotion he came around from the other side of the house and came up behind Collier. Boone, aiming at Collier, shot sheriff Wallace by mistake. As Collier and Charles attended to Wallace, Boone left the area. The other four brothers went into town and turned themselves in.\u000aA mob then tried to avenge the sheriff and attacked the jail, January 17, 1889, but the brothers were able to fight off the mob.\u000aOn January 19, 1889 (after dark), the deputy then decided to move the four brothers to Weatherford, Texas, chained together along with two other prisoners (William D. Burkhart and Louis Clift). But the two wagons and one buggy were ambushed along the way at Dry Creek (about two miles from Graham). The deputies guarding the brothers ran away, in league with the ambush party.\u000aThe brothers managed to get some weapons, get to cover, and hold off the attack, but Alfred and Lewellyn were killed. Also killed were three of the mob that attacked the Marlows: Frank Harmison, Sam Criswell, and Bruce Wheeler. George and Charles were both wounded (Charles severely so) but escaped, using Burkhart as a hostage and being aided by Clift, and went to their mother's house on the Denson farm. (About halfway there, they stopped in Finis at a farm house and asked to stay the night, but were refused. George spotted an ax and borrowed it to separate the men from their shackles. As soon Burkhart was free, he ran off). Also wounded were Johnson, Logan, and Clinton "Clint" Rutherford. The Marlows stayed at their mother's home until lawmen came from outside Young County, and then gave themselves up. Deputy U.S. Marshal W. F. Morton of Dallas finally arrived, took them into custody, and transported them, first toward Weatherford and then, fearing another ambush, to Dallas.\u000a"This is the first time in the annals of history where unarmed prisoners, shackled together, ever repelled a mob. Such cool courage that preferred to fight against such great odds and die in glorious battle." Judge Andrew Phelps McCormick, 1891.\u000aBoone had gone to stay with his girlfriend and her family, the Harbolts, in the vicinity of Marlow, but the girlfriend's brother, William "G.E." Harbolt, put some poison in the food that his sister took to Boone. William Harbolt had obtained the poison from a Dr. Carter. Harbolt, along with bounty hunters Jim "Martin" Beavers and John E. Derrickson (aka Direkson), shot his dead body for the $1,700 reward offered for his capture ($200 by the State of Texas and $1,500 by Young County), dead or alive. An autopsy by Doctor R. N. Price determined that he was already dead when he had been shot, and that he had died of arsenic poisoning. The three men were arrested but released on bail. Harbolt was later shot in the Chickasaw Nation and Beavers and Derrickson each received 15-year sentences.\u000aThe five Marlow brothers had been falsely accused of stealing horses, and after the shootout that left three dead, George and Charles were finally acquitted in a Dallas trial. The two brothers then moved to Colorado and became deputies.\u000aAs deputy marshal Ed Johnson was lying wounded at his home, he gave a newspaper interview to the Graham Leader. In the interview, he said that deputy sheriff Eugene Logan had been one of the guards taking the prisoners to Weatherford, and had been wounded in doing so. In fact, Logan had not been one of the guards but one of the men in the ambush party. The insistence that something be done in the edition of January 24 of the Graham Leader, and this slip up by Johnson, started an investigation into the affair by the U.S. marshal for the Northern District of Texas in Dallas, William Lewis Cabell. In addition, the U.S. attorney sent an investigator to Young County.\u000aCollier, deputy Johnson, David "Dink" Allen, attorney Robert "Bob" Holman, Jack Wilkins, W. R. Benedict, county attorney Phlete A. Martin, deputy tax collector John Levell, constable Marion A. Wallace (the dead sheriff's nephew), Wil Hollis, William Bee Williams, Richard "Dick" Cook, deputy sheriff Eugene Logan, constable Sam Waggoner, Clint Rutherford, and Verna Wilkerson were all charged with conspiring to falsify a case against the Marlow brothers, conspiring to kill the Marlow brothers in an ambush, and murdering Alfred and Lewellyn Marlow while they were in the protective custody of a United States Marshal. However, only Cook, Hollis, Levell, Logan, Rutherford, Waggoner, Wallace, Wilkerson, and Williams, went to trial.\u000aJohn William "Bee" Williams and Thomas B. Collier (typhoid fever) died while in jail in mid-January 1891.\u000aGeorge and Charles were summoned to testify and asked for and received protective custody from U.S. Marshal George A. Knight of Dallas. Additionally, Knight made George a "Special Deputy", while Charles was made an "attached witness". Phlete A. Martin and John Frank Spears (Spears was in jail with the Marlows at the time of the mob attack) both turned state's evidence and testified against the conspirators.\u000aClinton Rutherford was found not guilty on November 22, 1890, and the court removed Rutherford from the indictment, but bound over Eugene Logan and Verna Wilkerson. Logan, Waggoner, and Wallace were found guilty of conspiracy and not guilty of murder on April 17, 1891, and each sentenced to a $5,000 fine and ten years imprisonment. The other defendants (Cook, Levell, Hollis, and Wilkerson) were found not guilty.\u000aThe case involving Eugene Logan, William Williams, Verna Wilkerson, and Clinton Rutherford (United States v. Eugene Logan et al.) was separated from the other defendants, and went all the way to the United States Supreme Court. (See Logan v. United States, 144 U.S. 263 (1892), filed March 16, 1891.)\u000a"A citizen of the United States, in the custody of a United States Marshall under a lawful commitment to answer for an offense against the United States, has the right to be protected by the United States against lawless violence; this right is a right secured to him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and a conspiracy to injure or oppress him in its free exercise or enjoyment is punishable under section 5508 of the Revised Statutes."\u000aThe city of Graham had wanted to keep a federal court in their town, but after this incident the federal government denied that request.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of American films of 1965\u000aJohn Wayne filmography\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aThe Sons of Katie Elder on IMDb\u000aThe Sons of Katie Elder at Rotten Tomatoes\u000aThe Sons of Katie Elder at AllMovie\u000aThe Sons of Katie Elder at the TCM Movie Database\u000aThe Sons of Katie Elder at the American Film Institute Catalog

aVBaby Gramps is a guitar performer, who, though born in Miami, Florida, has been based in the Northwest U.S. for at least the last 40 years. He is famous for his palindromes. Baby Gramps started performing in 1964 and is still playing professionally as of 2016.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Style ==\u000a\u000aBaby Gramps plays a mixture of styles and eras including traditional blues, children's and labor songs, and his own compositions. His busy and unusual guitar style includes flat and finger picking, and "chording" with the back of his hand and his elbow. His singing styles include throat singing. His performance is based in part on improvisation and he often encourages audience participation. Baby Gramps has performed as a street musician, and has toured with Artis the Spoonman, Béla Fleck and the Flecktones and Phish. His rendition of "The Teddy Bears' Picnic" was featured in Martin Bell's Academy Award-nominated documentary film, Streetwise.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Popularity ==\u000aWriter Patrick Ferris said he has "a mass appeal in the sense that any audience between the age of 2 and 102 are captivated by his vaudeville antics, hilarious lyrics and animated guitar playing... His voice is a cross between Popeye the Sailor and a Didgeridoo and the plinkity plink of his VERY worn National steel guitar, sounds like a wind up jack in the box. If you listen closely and know anything about music, you'll realize Gramps is an absolutely incredible guitar player. Being a professional musician for over 40 years can't help but give you some sort of chops, but Gramps is a modern day Robert Johnson; a revolutionary guitarist that, like Thelonious Monk on piano, can play the notes 'between the cracks.'"\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discography ==\u000aSame Ol' Timeously: Vocalisthenics & Stunt Guitar (CD, Grampophone 1001), 2000\u000aHossradish CD (Baby Gramps Trio), 2003\u000aBaptized on Swamp Water CD (Baby Gramps & his Back Swamp Potioners), 2006\u000aRogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys (two tracks, 'Cape Cod Girls' and 'Old Man of the Sea' on compilation CD), Anti-Records, 2006\u000aOutertainment CD (Baby Gramps & Peter Stampfel), Red Newt Records, 2010\u000aVideos:\u000aSomeDemos Originally released on VHS in 1996 Re-released on DVD together with "Sauteed To A Fine Crisp" in 2006.\u000aFilmed on 8/26/93 when Baby Gramps opened for Phish in Portland OR. 1) Richland Woman Blues 2) Back Swamp Potioner 3) Let's all be fairies Running time: 20 min.

The Labour MP Richard Burden was nonetheless returned, albeit with a majority reduced by 5.6%. He was re-elected, with a majority reduced by 14.1%, in 2010. In 2015, Burden was re-elected with a majority of 2,509 votes and a vote share of 41.6%, which made Northfield the most marginal seat in Birmingham, as the margin in nearby Birmingham Edgbaston, traditionally Labour's weakest seat in the city, rose to be 197 votes more than Northfield. Two years later at the 2017 snap election, Burden had increased his majority to 4,667 votes and his vote share to 53.2% on an overall turnout of 44,348 voters; despite this, due to the Labour majority in Edgbaston rising to almost 7,000 votes, Northfield is now Labour's weakest seat in Birmingham by a considerable margin.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Boundaries ==\u000a1950-1955: The County Borough of Birmingham Wards of Northfield, Selly Oak, and Weoley.\u000a1955-1974: The County Borough of Birmingham wards of King's Norton, Northfield, and Weoley.\u000a1974-1983: As above less King's Norton, plus Longbridge\u000a1983-1997: The City of Birmingham wards of Bartley Green, Longbridge, Northfield, and Weoley.\u000a1997-2010: As above less Bartley Green\u000a2010\u2013present: As above plus King's Norton\u000aFollowing the review of parliamentary representation in Birmingham and the West Midlands, the Boundary Commission for England created a modified Northfield seat which gained the ward of Kings Norton (previously in the Selly Oak constituency).\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aSummary of results\u000aThe 2015 result gave the seat the 26th-smallest majority of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.\u000aSince creation in 1950, Labour Party MPs have been elected and served the seat with the exception of the period from 1979 to 1992 while the Conservative Party were in government, with a one-year gap caused by a Labour win in a by-election, in 1982.

aVBirmingham Moor Street is one of three main railway stations in the city centre of Birmingham, England, along with Birmingham New Street and Birmingham Snow Hill.\u000aToday's Moor Street station is a combination of the original station, opened in 1909 by the Great Western Railway as a terminus for local trains, and a newer Moor Street station with through platforms, a short distance from the original, which opened in 1987, replacing the original. The two were combined into one station in 2002, when the original was reopened and restored, and the newer station rebuilt in 1930s style.\u000aMoor Street has become more important in recent years; two of the original terminus platforms were reopened in 2010, and the station is now the terminus of many Chiltern Railways services from London Marylebone, as well as being an important stop for local services on the Snow Hill Lines. It is now the second busiest railway station in Birmingham.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Earlier history (1909-1987) ===\u000aAt the turn of the 20th Century, suburban rail traffic into Birmingham was growing rapidly. The Great Western Railway greatly expanded their facilities in the city at that time to cope with the demands. Snow Hill station, their main station in Birmingham, was extensively rebuilt and expanded. However, the twin tracked Snow Hill tunnel, which ran underneath the city centre into Snow Hill from the south, did not have enough capacity to accommodate all of the traffic, and widening the tunnel was considered impractical. In order to solve the capacity problem therefore, Moor Street station was built at the opposite end of the tunnel to take terminating local trains from the south and relieve traffic.\u000a\u000aIt was a terminus for local trains from Leamington Spa, and local trains from Stratford-upon-Avon via the recently opened North Warwickshire Line. It was opened with temporary buildings in July 1909, the permanent buildings were completed in 1914. The station was located south of the entrance to Snow Hill tunnel, at the end of a short branch (the Moor Street branch) which connected the station to the main line, it originally had a single 700 ft (213 metre) long island platform with two platform faces, a third side platform, 600 ft (183 metres) long was added in 1930. The through tracks to Snow Hill running alongside however were not provided with platforms.\u000aBecause the station was built on a confined site, it was equipped with two electrically operated traversers at the buffer end of the platforms as a space saving measure, in order to allow locomotives to move sideways between tracks, instead of having to reverse through crossovers. The traversers were removed from service in 1967, when all services to the station switched to diesel multiple unit operation.\u000aTrains only used Moor Street during Mondays to Saturdays, on Sundays, Snow Hill station was quiet enough to allow the train to terminate there instead.\u000aIn 1948, upon nationalisation, Moor Street came under the control of the Western Region of British Railways, transferring to the London Midland Region, in 1963.\u000aSnow Hill station was run down during the late 1960s, and on 4 March 1968 the line between the junction with the Moor Street branch and Birmingham Snow Hill, including Snow Hill tunnel closed, leaving Moor Street as an isolated terminus for local trains. Moor Street itself came under threat of closure in 1969, however five local authorities objected and took the case to the High Court, which sided with the local authorities, preventing closure.\u000aFrom 1967 until the mid-1970s, Moor Street was at its lowest ebb; the infrequent local trains used Moor Street during peak hours only, at other times they ran to and from New Street. In the 1970s, local services from the station came under the control of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (WMPTE) under whose auspices service frequencies were improved. From 1975, a regular interval half hourly service was introduced between Moor Street and Dorridge and Shirley.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Goods station ====\u000a\u000aMoor Street was originally provided with a large goods station situated adjacent to the passenger station, which opened in 1914. It was built using the increasingly rare Hennebique technique for re-inforced concrete (q.v.) of which few examples still exist in the UK. This took many goods trains which would otherwise have passed through Snow Hill tunnel. Because it was built in a confined space on a steep gradient, the goods station was built on two levels, with one high level, and two low level sheds. Three wagon lifts were provided to transfer wagons to and from the low level sheds. The low level sheds were equipped with electric traversers to move wagons between the lifts and sidings where they would be loaded and unloaded.\u000aA major source of traffic at the goods station was fresh fruit and vegetables, which would arrive at the station in the mornings, and be taken straight to the nearby market in the Bull Ring. The goods station was finally closed on 6 November 1972, and the main high-level shed was demolished three years later. The site of the former goods station is now partly occupied by the Selfridges Building, and some of the former low-level goods sheds are now used as a car-park.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Relocation ===\u000aIn the mid-1980s funding became available to reopen a station at Birmingham Snow Hill, along with Snow Hill tunnel. As part of the reopening scheme, a new Moor Street station with through platforms was built at the southern portal of the restored tunnel. On completion of this project, the original Moor Street terminus became redundant, and closed down. The final train, on 26 September 1987, was a steam special hauled by a locomotive from Birmingham Railway Museum, Clun Castle.\u000aThe original station, now a Grade II listed building, was not demolished but, by the late 1990s, the former platforms were overgrown and dilapidated, and cracks in the wall were visible from the road side including some caused by the impact of a runaway bus. After a public meeting called by the Tyseley Railway Museum and held at the station in March 1988 the "Moor Street Station Historical Society" was formed to "Save Our Station". Dr Bernard Juby, a medical practitioner from nearby Yardley, became its Chairman and immediately set about making the Station and its warehousing Grade II Listed Buildings. Large teams of volunteers met each week-end to clean and preserve the various buildings. The existing artifacts were carefully renovated and stored and were subsequently re-used when the station reopened to the public.\u000aIn the 1990s the range of services stopping at Moor Street were expanded for the first time since it opened. In 1993, limited stop Network SouthEast services were introduced from London Marylebone to Snow Hill via Banbury and Leamington Spa, stopping at Moor Street, thus making Moor Street a main line station for the first time. This service was taken over by Chiltern Railways following privatisation. In 1995, the completion of the "Jewellery Line" project north of Snow Hill, meant that through services to Worcester via Stourbridge Junction and Kidderminster were introduced.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Restoration ===\u000a\u000aIn the 2000s, the growth in services on the Snow Hill Lines again strained capacity through Snow Hill tunnel, and so Chiltern Railways and the Birmingham Alliance decided to restore the original terminus and reopen it, to allow some services to terminate there rather than Snow Hill. In 2002 the original Moor Street station building platforms were renovated at a cost of £11 million. However, there was a long delay before the old terminal platforms were connected to the network and opened for service, because of delays in carrying out the necessary signalling work by Network Rail. Two of the three former terminal platforms, numbered 3 and 4 were reopened for use on 11 December 2010, platform 5 remains disused.\u000aThe restoration project also unified the original station and the 1980s station into one. The main 1980s station entrance was demolished, and a new passenger access was created to the through platforms using the old station's ticket hall. The footbridge and canopies on the through platforms were also rebuilt to match the style of the original station.\u000a\u000aRefurbished in 1930s style, the station has reproduction lamps, clock, seating, and signage. The renovation won the Railway Heritage Trust award for 2004 and The Birmingham Civic Society's Renaissance Award for 2005. The station became home to the cosmetically restored second GWR 2884 Class 2-8-0 No. 2885, which, until being removed on 4 June 2013, stood in the disused platform five. Further renovations during 2011\u201312 included the installation of GWR-inspired gilt signage on the front and side elevations of the station building.\u000aSince the December 2010 timetable change, two of the three south facing bay platforms at Moor Street station are now connected to the network and in use, enabling some of the Chiltern services to and from London Marylebone to terminate at Moor Street instead of Snow Hill. Local Chiltern stopping services to Leamington Spa will also begin and terminate at the new terminal platforms. Chiltern Railways are engaged in a large-scale redevelopment of their route from London Marylebone to Birmingham with improvements to allow higher speeds.\u000aA fast train service between Moor Street and London Marylebone was introduced on 5 September 2011 using locomotive-hauled coaches, furthering the competition with Virgin Trains' West Coast Main Line services from Birmingham New Street.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Services ==\u000aMoor Street is currently served by West Midlands Railway who run local services on the Snow Hill Lines, and by Chiltern Railways who run longer distance services to London Marylebone via the Chiltern Main Line:\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Chiltern Railways ===\u000aSome of the Chiltern London services terminate at Snow Hill, calling at Moor Street's through platforms, while other services terminate at Moor Street's terminal platforms. Some of the through Chiltern services continue beyond Birmingham to Kidderminster during peak hours. The Chiltern service is:\u000a2 trains per hour (tph) to London Marylebone via Leamington Spa, Banbury, and High Wycombe.\u000aA two-hourly stopping service to Leamington Spa\u000a\u000a\u000a=== West Midlands Railway ===\u000aSix West Midlands Railway trains per hour call at Moor Street in each direction, running as follows:\u000aEastbound:\u000a3 trains per hour to Whitlocks End:\u000aof which one continues to Stratford-upon-Avon\u000a3 trains per hour to Dorridge\u000aof which one continues to Stratford-upon-Avon\u000ain peak hours some London Midland services continue from Dorridge to Leamington Spa.\u000a\u000aWestbound:\u000a6 trains per hour to Stourbridge Junction:\u000aof which four continue to Kidderminster:\u000aof which two continue to Worcester Foregate Street\u000a(services beyond Worcester, to Malvern and Hereford are irregular, generally about one per hour)\u000a\u000aOn summer Sundays, Moor Street is used by steam locomotives running tourist specials between Snow Hill and Stratford upon Avon and trains between Snow Hill and Tyseley run by Vintage Trains.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Links to New Street station ==\u000aMoor Street station is 660 yards (600 metres) away from New Street station; the city's main railway station. There is a signposted route for passengers travelling between New Street and Moor Street stations which involves a short walk through a tunnel under the Bullring shopping centre. Although the railway lines into New Street pass directly underneath Moor Street station, there is no track connection. In 2013 a new direct walkway was opened between the two stations making interchange easier.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Proposed future developments ==\u000aPlans are being pursued to introduce new services into Moor Street by constructing new chords linking the station to the Camp Hill Line, which is currently mostly used by freight trains. The new chords would run into Moor Street's terminus platforms, and would allow a new local passenger service south to Kings Norton and beyond, including new stations at Moseley, Kings Heath and Hazelwell. This would also allow for new local services into Moor Street on the lines from Birmingham to Tamworth and Nuneaton including a new station at Castle Bromwich. The currently disused third bay platform would be reopened, and an additional new fourth bay platform would be opened to accommodate the new services.\u000aIn a West Midlands & Chiltern Routes Study it is proposed that services to the South West (via Worcester) and the East Midlands (Nottingham and Leicester) will be rerouted into Moor Street from New Street after the construction of the Camp Hill Chords.\u000aNetwork Rail have predicted that the number of passengers using Moor Street will grow to 8.9 million per year by 2023 and then to over 12 million by 2043.\u000aThe High Speed 2 terminus in Birmingham is planned to be built on an adjacent site and will likely be linked to Moor Street, though have a separate name (either Fazeley Street or Curzon Street). The station and high-speed line is proposed to be completed by the mid-2020s.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aTransport in Birmingham\u000aTransport for West Midlands\u000aBirmingham Snow Hill railway station\u000aBirmingham New Street railway station\u000aChiltern Main Line\u000aNorth Warwickshire Line\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aThe Birmingham Civic Society\u000aVintage Trains page\u000a\u000aTrain times and station information for Birmingham Moor Street railway station from National Rail\u000aRail Around Birmingham and the West Midlands: Birmingham Moor Street railway station\u000aWarwickshire Railways page\u000aMoor Street station\u000aMoor Street railway station layout

aVActual malice in United States law is a legal requirement imposed upon public officials or public figures when they file suit for libel (defamatory printed communications). Unlike other individuals who are less well-known to the general public, public officials and public figures are held to a higher standard for what they must prove before they may succeed in a defamation lawsuit.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThis term was adopted by the Supreme Court in its landmark 1964 ruling in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, in which the Court held that:\u000a\u000aThe constitutional guarantees require, we think, a Federal rule that prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with 'actual malice'\u2014that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u000a\u000aAlthough defined within the context of a media defendant, the rule requiring proof of actual malice applies to all defendants including individuals. The standard can make it very difficult to prevail in a defamation case, even when allegations made against a public figure are unfair or are proved to be false.\u000aThe term was not newly invented for the case but was a term from existing libel law. In many jurisdictions proof of "actual malice" was required in order for punitive damages to be awarded, or for other increased penalties. For example, Times v. Sullivan examined an existing Alabama statute that required proof of actual malice before an award of punitive damages would be permitted. Since proof of the writer's malicious intentions is hard to ascertain, proof that the writer knowingly published a falsehood was generally accepted as proof of malice, under the assumption that only a malicious person would knowingly publish a falsehood. In Sullivan, the Supreme Court adopted the term and gave it constitutional significance, at the same time defining it in terms of the proof that had previously been usual.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Proof of malice ==\u000aActual malice is different from common law malice, a term that indicates spite or ill will. It may also differ from malice as defined in state libel law, as reflected in the 1983 case of Carol Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc., although states may not define a lower threshold for defamation claims than that required by the First Amendment.\u000aThe existence of actual malice may be shown in many ways, as long as the claim is properly supported by admissible evidence. Malice may be proved through any competent evidence, either direct or circumstantial. All of the relevant circumstances surrounding the transaction may be shown, provided they are not too remote, including threats, other defamatory statements, subsequent statements made by the defendant, any circumstances that indicate the existence of rivalry, ill will, or hostility between the parties, and facts that tend to show a reckless disregard of the plaintiff's rights on the part of the defendant.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aWestmoreland v.

aVThe 2012\u201313 season was the 127th season in the history of Luton Town Football Club. The club competed in the Conference Premier for the fourth consecutive year, finishing in their lowest ever position of seventh place.\u000aManager Paul Buckle left the club on 19 February 2013 after a winless run of games left the club 14 points off the top of the table. Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still was appointed in charge of Luton shortly afterwards, though could secure only a seventh-place finish in the league \u2013 worse than the previous season's lowest ever finish of fifth in the English football league system.\u000aThe club did, however, make history during the season by becoming the first non-League team to defeat a Premier League club in the FA Cup, beating Norwich City 1\u20130 at Carrow Road. The club eventually reached the Fifth Round of the competition, the furthest they had progressed since the 1993\u201394 season.\u000aThis article covers the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Background ==\u000a\u000aAfter a 30-point deduction and consequent relegation in 2008\u201309 ended an 89-year stay in The Football League, Luton Town have attempted three unsuccessful campaigns for promotion out of non-League football, losing in the play-offs each time, most recently in a 2\u20131 defeat by York City at Wembley Stadium in May 2012. During that season, a seven-game winless run towards the end of the campaign left Luton outside the play-off places, resulting in manager Gary Brabin being replaced by Paul Buckle on a two-year contract. Buckle's tenure saw the club win five of their next eight games, qualify for the play-offs and beat Wrexham 3\u20132 on aggregate in the semi-final, before the loss to York in the final.\u000aStating his intention to reduce the size of the squad and "bring players into the club that are not failures", Buckle released a number of players in the close-season, including Ed Asafu-Adjaye, Charlie Henry, Christian Tavernier, Danny Crow, Dan Gleeson, Shane Blackett, and Amari Morgan-Smith, while Curtis Osano rejected a new contract to sign for League Two side AFC Wimbledon. Robbie Willmott and Godfrey Poku also rejected contracts, with Poku signing a deal to join Mansfield Town. Captain George Pilkington, too, elected to join Mansfield. Most notable was the departure of Keith Keane to League One side Preston North End after nine seasons with Luton in which he had made almost 300 appearances.\u000aLuton signed various out-of-contract players themselves, with former Stevenage captain Ronnie Henry, Gillingham players Danny Spiller and Garry Richards (Richards' transfer becoming permanent on 1 July), and Gateshead striker Jon Shaw, who had scored 35 goals the previous season, all joining the club for free. The club also bought Wycombe Wanderers forward Scott Rendell for an undisclosed fee and made striker Andre Gray's loan from Hinckley United permanent, as he joined the club on a two-year contract for a fee of £30,000. Meanwhile, Jake Howells, JJ O'Donnell, Alex Lacey and Lewis Kidd signed contract extensions.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Review ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== July ===\u000aThe transfers arranged for the beginning of the month became official, with Keith Keane, George Pilkington, Godfrey Poku and Robbie Willmott all leaving the club, and defender Garry Richards joining. On 2 July, Luton signed former Torquay United defender Lathaniel Rowe-Turner on a free transfer. A day later, former Luton goalkeeper Carl Emberson re-joined the club as first team development coach, linking back up with Paul Buckle, who he had been a coach with at Bristol Rovers. Midfielder Alex Lawless and youth team graduates Alasan Ann and Newman Carney signed one-year contract extensions on 4 July. This was followed by striker Dan Walker, who had previously rejected two contracts and been placed on the transfer list, signing a one-year deal himself on 5 July. Midfielder John Paul Kissock joined Macclesfield Town on loan for six months on 9 July. Iraqi midfielder Yaser Kasim joined Luton from Championship side Brighton & Hove Albion on a six-month loan on 12 July. The club's first friendly game was against local side Hitchin Town on 16 July, ending in a 1\u20130 victory to Luton. Three trialists played during the match; former Luton goalkeeper Dean Brill, ex-Southend United striker Harry Crawford, and 18-year-old former Leicester City youth midfielder Matt Robinson, who had been training with the club since the end of the 2011\u201312 season. Robinson impressed enough to be offered a two-year contract, which he signed on 18 July. Forward Aaron O'Connor left the club to join Newport County on a free transfer on 25 July. After further pre-season victories over lower league opposition, Luton drew 0\u20130 at home to League Two club Wycombe Wanderers before winning 2\u20130 against a strong Ipswich Town side of the Championship on 28 July. On the final day of July, Luton signed Brill on a two-year contract after he featured in goal for three friendlies. Brill had started his career at Luton, playing for the Hatters 97 times between 2003 and 2009.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== August ===\u000aOn 1 August, Andre Boucaud joined League One side Notts County on loan until January 2013. Manager Paul Buckle had previously stated that "[Boucaud]'s not in our plans." Goalkeeper Lewis Kidd was loaned to Spartan South Midlands Football League side Dunstable Town on 4 August. Ronnie Henry was announced as Luton's captain for the season on 6 August. 18-year-old striker Jake Woolley, who had made his debut as a youth player in the previous season, signed a two-year professional contract on 10 August. Luton started their season once again with high expectations and as the bookmakers' favourite for promotion, but this impression was dealt a reality check within the first 35 minutes of their opening game against Gateshead on 11 August as they conceded two first-half goals, including one from former Luton striker Liam Hatch. Substitute Jon Shaw scored on his debut to halve the deficit, coincidentally against his former club, and a goal from Stuart Fleetwood meant Luton drew 2\u20132. A 2\u20130 away victory over Kidderminster Harriers came three days later, Fleetwood scoring both goals. Alasan Ann joined Southern Football League Premier side Kettering Town on a one-month loan on 16 August. On 17 August, Luton played against Hyde, coming from a goal down scored by former-Hatter Matthew Blinkhorn to win 2\u20131 courtesy of a first goal from midfielder JJ O'Donnell and Fleetwood's fourth of the season. Luton lost 1\u20130 at home to AFC Telford United on 25 August, Paul Buckle's first league defeat as manager in a game that saw Ronnie Henry and Telford defender Dan Preston shown red cards, which was swiftly followed two days later with a 3\u20131 win over Ebbsfleet United. Stuart Fleetwood scored his fifth and sixth goals of the season, with Scott Rendell getting his first goal for the club. Following on from the red cards in the game with Telford, both clubs were charged by the Football Association with failing to control their players. In addition, striker Jon Shaw, who began the incident but was not seen by the referee, was charged by the FA with violent conduct and banned for three matches. With defenders Ronnie Henry and Alex Lacey suspended and injured respectively, Luton signed Gillingham centre-back Connor Essam on a one-month loan on the day of the transfer deadline.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== September ===\u000aLuton began September strongly with a 4\u20131 home victory against Macclesfield Town, the goals coming from Jake Howells, Andre Gray, Scott Rendell and Stuart Fleetwood. A 3\u20132 win over local rivals Cambridge United followed three days later, Gray scoring again and defenders János Kovács and Dean Beckwith also on the scoresheet with goals from set pieces. Injuries to strikers Fleetwood and Rendell, plus Jon Shaw's suspension, led to Northampton Town forward Jake Robinson signing on a one-month loan on 7 September. He played in Luton's first away defeat of the season the next day, a heavy 3\u20130 loss to Alfreton Town which caused Paul Buckle to apologise for the performance to the Luton fans. Youth team graduate Newman Carney's contract was terminated by the club on 12 September, with the defender having failed to consistently appear for training. Luton drew 0\u20130 at home to Wrexham on 15 September, leaving them two points off the top of the table. This gap increased to five points six days later as Luton were heavily beaten 4\u20131 by Grimsby Town. Central defenders Kovács and Beckwith were both criticised in the defeat, the latter scoring an own goal and the former dropped from the first-team for Luton's next game against Tamworth on 25 September. Luton won the game 2\u20131 with goals from substitutes Yaser Kasim and Fleetwood. With the team still conceding goals from set-pieces, Buckle signed Guiseley and England C captain and centre-back Simon Ainge on a month's loan on 27 September. On the same day, left-back Greg Taylor and midfielder Adam Watkins, neither of whom had been playing in the first-team, were sent on one-month loans to Tamworth and Kidderminster Harriers respectively. Ainge partnered fellow loanee Connor Essam in central defence two days later as Luton beat Southport 3\u20131, with Kovács and Beckwith not even in the squad of 16 players. Fleetwood's ninth strike of the season and two goals from Rendell secured three points.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== October ===\u000aConnor Essam's loan from Gillingham was extended for a further month on 3 October. Luton beat Lincoln City 2\u20131 on 6 October with the Hatters' goals coming from Jon Shaw, his first since the opening day, and an own goal from Lincoln goalkeeper Paul Farman. Forward Jake Robinson and defender Simon Ainge both signed extensions to their loans shortly afterwards; Robinson for one month and Ainge for two. Additionally, Ainge's parent club Guiseley reached an agreement to sell him to Luton when the transfer window in January 2013. Luton lost 3\u20132 at home to Braintree Town on 9 October, with Stuart Fleetwood sent off for two bookable offences early in the first-half, both controversial, leaving Luton playing the majority of the game with ten men. Four days later, Luton defeated Nuneaton Town with both goals scored in the last five minutes by midfielder Alex Lawless. On 19 October, Luton signed Macclesfield Town's Guinea-Bissau international midfielder Arnaud Mendy on loan until January, at which point the transfer would become permanent. In exchange, Luton midfielder John Paul Kissock would join Macclesfield permanently. Luton beat local rivals Cambridge United 2\u20130 in the FA Cup to qualify for the First Round with goals from strikers Andre Gray and Shaw. Luton came from behind on 27 October to beat Forest Green Rovers 2\u20131, with Fleetwood equalising for his tenth goal of the season and Scott Rendell netting a last-minute penalty.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== November ===\u000aOn 3 November Luton scored a late equaliser in a 1\u20131 FA Cup First Round draw against Nuneaton Town to earn a replay at Liberty Way. Two days later, Luton signed York City midfielder Jonathan Smith on a two-month loan. Luton lost 1\u20130 to Hereford United on 7 November and slipped to third in the league, four points behind leaders Newport County. The club then lost three days later at home to newly promoted Dartford, which saw them fall out of the play-off places and down to sixth in the table. Scott Rendell scored twice as Luton defeated Nuneaton 2\u20130 in their FA Cup replay on 13 November. They were drawn to play Dorchester Town in the Second Round, who were coincidentally also paired together in the FA Trophy draw. The teams drew 2\u20132 in their Trophy tie, meaning a replay was required in early December. In the league, Luton drew 2\u20132 away to Mansfield Town, with striker Andre Gray scoring both goals for the club.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== December ===\u000aLuton defeated Dorchester Town on 1 December in the FA Cup Second Round, and were drawn to play Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers at Kenilworth Road in the Third Round. The club then played Dorchester again in their FA Trophy replay three days later, winning 3\u20131. The club defeated Alfreton Town 3\u20130 on 8 December to win for the first time in four attempts in the league, but were then comprehensively beaten 5\u20132 by Newport County at Rodney Parade just a few days later. Jonathan Smith was recalled by his parent club York City on 11 December, almost one month before his loan was due to end.\u000aLuton progressed to the Third round of the FA Trophy by defeating Matlock Town 2\u20131 on 15 December. Winger Scott Neilson was signed on a six-month contract from Crawley Town on 24 December, with the transfer going through officially on 1 January 2013. A series of postponements due to inclement weather meant Luton did not play again until 26 December, where they defeated Woking 3\u20131. Despite Jonathan Smith being recalled earlier in the month, Luton signed him from York on an 18-month contract on 29 December for a fee of £50,000.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== January ===\u000aOn New Year's Day, Luton experienced their eighth league loss of the season, being beaten 3\u20131 by Woking in a reverse of the scoreline on Boxing Day. On 5 January, Luton beat Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers, a side 59 positions higher than them in the league system, 1\u20130. The winning goal came 45 seconds after half-time, scored by midfielder Alex Lawless to put the club into the FA Cup Fourth Round for the first time since the 2006\u201307 season. Lawless later won the FA Cup player of the round award. The club beat bottom-of-the-table club Barrow 6\u20131 on 8 January, with Jon Shaw scoring a hat-trick. Four days later, Luton progressed to the quarter-finals of the FA Trophy by scoring two late goals against Skelmersdale United. Luton dropped out of the play-off places with a 0\u20130 draw away to AFC Telford United on 15 January, albeit with games in hand.\u000aIn terms of transfers, Luton sold Andre Boucaud to Notts County and John Paul Kissock to Macclesfield Town for undisclosed fees on 10 January, while the loans of Simon Ainge and Arnaud Mendy were made permanent. Unfavoured defender Dean Beckwith was released from his contract in early January to join Eastleigh in the Conference South. Alex Lacey also joined Eastleigh, but on a one-month loan, while striker Jake Woolley signed on loan for Southern Football League Premier Division side Hitchin Town. Striker Dan Walker joined Braintree Town on a one-month loan on 17 January.\u000aLuton beat Premier League side Norwich City 1\u20130 away at Carrow Road on 26 January in the FA Cup Fourth Round, Scott Rendell's late goal ensuring that the club became the first non-League team in 24 years to defeat a top division side in the competition. This also marked the first time since the 1993\u201394 season that the club had progressed past the Fourth Round of the FA Cup.\u000aThe club signed winger Dave Martin on 29 January following his release from Southend United. Martin signed a contract until June 2014. Later the same day, Luton were knocked out of the FA Trophy by Grimsby Town in a 3\u20130 defeat. Following a long-term injury, winger James Dance joined Nuneaton Town on a one-month loan on 30 January. The next day, Luton signed Fleetwood Town central defender and captain Steve McNulty on an 18-month contract.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== February ===\u000aThe club lost 1\u20130 away to Barrow on 2 February, and also had Lathaniel Rowe-Turner sent off for violent conduct late on. Luton signed experienced defender Wayne Thomas on a free transfer on 4 February. Midfielder Adam Watkins joined Eastleigh on loan until the end of the season on 11 February. The club were left further adrift from promotion following a home draw with Forest Green Rovers and an away defeat by Dartford in early February. The club's FA Cup run came to an end on 16 February at the Fifth Round after losing 3\u20130 to Millwall at Kenilworth Road in front of the largest crowd of the season.\u000aManager Paul Buckle left Luton by mutual consent on 19 February two hours before the game against Macclesfield Town. The club cited "genuine personal reasons" for the split and expressed that they wanted Buckle to remain at the club for the next season to ensure continuity after successive years of changing managers. Assistant manager Alan Neilson was placed in temporary charge of the team, who drew 1\u20131 with a Macclesfield team that played 70 minutes without a recognised goalkeeper. Luton remained winless in six league games after losing 3\u20132 at home to Mansfield four days later, Lindon Meikle scoring the winner in the last minute following a mix-up between defenders Steve McNulty and Rowe-Turner.\u000aJohn Still left his long-standing managerial position at League Two club Dagenham & Redbridge to become the new Luton manager on 26 February. Alan Neilson again took charge of Luton's game that evening against Braintree Town, which they lost 2\u20130 to fall to tenth position in the table and 14 points off of the play-offs. Neilson apologised for the team's poor performance, stating "we're all in a real bad place, the players [and] myself".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== March ===\u000aJohn Still made his first signing on 1 March, loaning in-form striker Alex Wall from Conference South side Maidenhead United following injuries to regular strikers Jon Shaw and Scott Rendell, and illness to Andre Gray. Still's first game as Luton manager on 2 March saw the club win for the first time in eight games, beating Stockport County 1\u20130 with Jake Howells scoring the only goal of the match. This also marked the club's first away victory in the league for over four months. The club signed 19-year-old Millwall defender Jake Goodman on loan until the end of the season on 4 March. It was also announced that Terry Harris, John Still's deputy at Dagenham, was the club's new assistant manager. Goodman started in Luton's 0\u20130 away draw with Nuneaton Town on 5 March. Still signed Nigerian midfielder Solomon Taiwo, who he had worked with at Dagenham & Redbridge, on a free transfer on 7 March. Luton drew 1\u20131 on 9 March at home to Hereford United, Dave Martin scoring his first goal for the club. Meanwhile, winger James Dance rejoined Nuneaton on loan until the end of the season on 11 March. One day later, in a performance described by Still as having "no positives", Luton lost 2\u20131 at home to relegation-threatened Hyde in front of Kenilworth Road's lowest league crowd in over 11 years. The club then drew 0\u20130 with league leaders Wrexham on 16 March. Three days later, Luton won their second game under Still with a 1\u20130 home win over Stockport County, Steve McNulty scoring the winning goal. The same day, coaches Carl Emberson and Stuart Cash, who were hired by previous manager Paul Buckle, left the club with immediate effect. Luton drew 0\u20130 with Tamworth on 23 March, securing their fifth clean sheet in seven matches in the process. The club signed left-back Scott Griffiths on a contract until the end of the season two days later. Griffiths had previously played over 200 games for John Still at former club Dagenham & Redbridge. Defender Greg Taylor, who was dropped from the team following mistakes in the defeat by Hyde earlier in the month, joined Mansfield Town on loan until the end of the season on 28 March. Wayne Thomas also left the club on loan, joining League Two side Rochdale. John Still announced that, along with Taylor, five other out-of-contract players would leave Luton in the summer: central defender János Kovács, wingers Scott Neilson and James Dance, and strikers Alasan Ann and Stuart Fleetwood. In addition, midfielder Arnaud Mendy was placed on the transfer list. Luton drew 2\u20132 with fellow mid-table side Cambridge United on 30 March, Jon Shaw and Solomon Taiwo scoring the goals.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== April ===\u000aApril began with Luton losing 2\u20131 at home to league leaders Kidderminster Harriers. The club then suffered their heaviest defeat in over four years with a 5\u20131 loss to Gateshead in what proved the lowest ever match attendance at a competitive Luton game; the game was played in front of only 382 fans. John Still did not attend the match, leaving assistant Terry Harris in charge while he instead scouted players for the 2013\u201314 season. The result saw Luton slip to 12th position in the table with relegation still a mathematical possibility, though this fear was allayed three days later as the club won 3\u20130 against Lincoln City. The next match saw Luton draw 1\u20131 with Grimsby Town, with the club described as playing "some of their best football of the season" and having 21 shots during the game. Leading scorer Andre Gray added two further goals to his season's total in a 2\u20132 home draw with promotion-chasing Newport County on 16 April. Luton then beat relegated Ebbsfleet United 2\u20130 two days later, Alex Wall scoring his first two goals for the club. Four players, Dean Brill, Simon Ainge, Lathaniel Rowe-Turner and Scott Rendell, were transfer listed following the game. Luton ended the season on 20 April with a 3\u20131 away win over Southport that meant they finished seventh in the league table. Matt Robinson scored his first senior goal and two further goals for Gray took his total for the season to 20.\u000aDefender Scott Griffiths and striker Alex Wall signed one and two-year contracts respectively on 24 April. Steve McNulty, who had been captaining the side while Ronnie Henry was injured, signed a two-year contract extension on 29 April.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== May ===\u000aThe club bought Southport players Shaun Whalley and Andrew Parry for undisclosed fees on 1 May, with the transfers planned to go through on 1 July 2013 when the transfer window opened. Both players signed two-year contracts. Midfielder Solomon Taiwo signed a one-year contract extension on 7 May, and player of the season Alex Lawless followed suit by signing a new two-year contract three days later after having talks with two unnamed League One clubs. The club signed young East Thurrock United goalkeeper Elliot Justham on a free transfer on 13 May. It was announced on 15 May that defender Wayne Thomas, goalkeeper Lewis Kidd and midfielder Adam Watkins had been released. Two days later, goalkeeper Mark Tyler signed a one-year contract extension and the club signed 21-year-old striker Mark Cullen, who had been released by Hull City. Luton signed left-back Danny Fitzsimons and midfielder Jim Stevenson from Conference North side Histon on 20 May, with both transfers coming into effect from 1 July. Fitzsimons had won three end-of-year awards at Histon, while Luton's scouts had informed John Still to "sign [Stevenson] straight away". It was announced on 24 May that striker Dan Walker would not be offered a new contract. He later signed for Hereford United, with the transfer becoming official on 1 July.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== June ===\u000aYoung midfielder Matt Robinson agreed a one-year contract extension on 5 June, with winger Dave Martin signing a similar deal a few days later. The club signed out-of-contract defender Anthony Charles on a one-year agreement on 19 June.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Match results ==\u000aLuton Town results given first.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Legend ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Pre-season friendlies ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Conference Premier ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Table ====\u000aUpdated to games played on 7 May 2013.\u000aSource: Football Conference\u000aRules for classification: 1) points; 2) goal difference; 3) number of goals scored(C) = Champion; (R) = Relegated; (P) = Promoted; (E) = Eliminated; (O) = Play-off winner; (A) = Advances to a further round.\u000aOnly applicable when the season is not finished:(Q) = Qualified to the phase of tournament indicated; (TQ) = Qualified to tournament, but not yet to the particular phase indicated; (RQ) = Qualified to the relegation tournament indicated; (DQ) = Disqualified from tournament.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Results by round ====\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Fixtures and results ====\u000a\u000a\u000a=== FA Cup ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== FA Trophy ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Player statistics ==\u000aCorrect as of 21 April 2013.

aVThe Imperial Service Order was established by King Edward VII in August 1902. It was awarded on retirement to the administration and clerical staff of the Civil Service throughout the British Empire for long and meritorious service. Normally a person must have served for 25 years to become eligible, but this might be shortened to 16 years for those serving in unsanitary locations. There was one class: Companion. Both men and women were eligible, and recipients of this order are entitled to use the post-nominal letters 'ISO'.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe new order was announced in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, on the day scheduled for the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. The coronation was postponed due to the King´s illness, however, and the statutes of the order were published on 8 August 1902, to coincide with the actual coronation on the following day. The first list of recipients was published the following month.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Insignia ==\u000a\u000aThe insignia of the order for men was an eight-pointed silver star, with the top ray obscured by a crown; the golden central medallion bore the cipher of the reigning monarch surrounded by the legend 'For Faithful Service'. This was suspended on a ribbon of crimson with a blue central stripe.\u000aThe insignia of the order for women had the same medallion as for men, surrounded by a silver laurel wreath and topped by a crown. This was suspended on a bow of crimson with a blue central stripe.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Imperial Service Medal ==\u000a\u000aCivil servants who complete 25 years service are eligible for the Imperial Service Medal (ISM) upon retirement. The medal is a silver circular medal bearing the effigy of the reigning monarch on the obverse, and the motif of a man resting after work with the legend 'For Faithful Service' on the reverse. The ribbon or bow pattern is the same as the Imperial Service Order.\u000a\u000a\u000a== 1993 reforms ==\u000aDuring the 1993 reform of the British honours system the British Government decided to make no new appointments to the Imperial Service Order; the Imperial Service Medal, however, continues to be awarded in recognition of certain individuals who make positive contributions. In recent years, only the government of Papua New Guinea continues to nominate candidates for both the Order and the Medal.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aBritish and Commonwealth orders and decorations\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVTag (Japanese: \u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u9b3c\u3054\u3063\u3053, Hepburn: Riaru Onigokko) is a 2015 Japanese suspense action horror film directed by Sion Sono and inspired by title of the novel Riaru Onigokko by Yusuke Yamada. It was released in Japan on July 11, 2015.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000aA quiet high school girl named Mitsuko survives a gust of wind which slices through her school bus, bisecting everyone else on board. She manages to escape the gust of wind, which chases her and kills all the other girls she comes into contact with. Dazed, and surrounded by numerous dead high school girls, she cleans herself off and changes into another schoolgirl's uniform and stumbles onto a different high school campus. She is greeted by girls named Aki, Sur (short for "Surreal") and Taeko. Not knowing who they are, Mitsuko confesses to Aki that she cannot remember if she ever attended this school and believes that she had a nightmare about girls being killed by a gust of wind. Aki reassures her that it was just a nightmare and proposes that they all cut class and go to the woods to cheer her up.\u000aIn the woods, the girls muse about whether destiny is truly predetermined and whether there are multiple realities with multiple versions of themselves. Sur illustrates predetermination with a white feather, stating that it would mean the time it takes for the feather to fall and where it will land are all decided already. Mitsuko wonders if there is nothing she can do to escape destiny, but Sur suggests that fate can be tricked by simply doing something one would never normally do, thus changing the outcome. The girls happily return to school. Aki and Mitsuko's homeroom teacher begins class, but suddenly brandishes a machine gun and opens fire, killing all the girls except Mitsuko. Before she can fire another round, Sur and Taeko burst in, grab Mitsuko, and the three hide. Another homeroom teacher, who has just killed her own entire class, finds and kills Taeko and Sur. Mitsuko and the remaining girls flee the grounds, running for their lives as they are gunned down. One of the girls recognizes Mitsuko and pleads for her to do something and think about why this is happening. The remaining girls are then sliced apart by a gust of wind.\u000aMitsuko continues to run, and then finds herself in increasingly surreal situations where her identity and appearance change: first, as a bride named Keiko on her wedding day, who is forced to marry a grotesque groom with a boar's head while her guests (all girls from the previous school) jeer at her, then later as a student named Izumi in the middle of a marathon, flanked by her friends and well wishers (again, made up of the girls from the school and wedding ceremony). In each scenario, she is supported by a version of her friend Aki, who either readies her for combat or distracts her attackers, made up of the groom and the two homeroom teachers from before. In every scenario, she must flee while the surrounding girls are slaughtered in various ways.\u000aAfter encountering a group of revenant girls who try to kill her after stating that so long as she lives, they all will continue to die, she is once again rescued by Aki. Aki tells her to focus and remember that although she is both Keiko and Izumi in these scenarios, she is ultimately Mitsuko. After returning to her original appearance as Mitsuko, Aki tells her that the two of them and all the girls are in a fictional world being observed by "someone" and that they will continue to hunt Mitsuko down and try to kill her while slaughtering the other girls unless Mitsuko, as the "main character", does something to change it. Each of the scenarios she encountered is a different world, and to reach the final one, Aki tells her that Mitsuko must brutally kill her. Urged on by Aki, Mitsuko reluctantly kills her and a portal opens up before her.\u000aShe finds herself in a lewd, dingy city called "Men's World" filled with only men who pervertedly enjoy a poster advertisement for a "legendary" violent 3D survival horror video game called "Tag", depicting Mitsuko, Keiko, and Izumi as playable characters. She passes out and awakens in a temple where all the girls from the various scenarios are showcased like mannequins. She arrives at a room where a decrepit old man is playing the game on his TV, showing the various trials she went through. Mitsuko is horrified to see full size models of herself, Keiko, Izumi, Aki, Sur, and Taeko behind a glass display case. The man tells her that she is in the future and that 150 years ago, she was a girl he had admired as a fellow student. When she died, he managed to take her DNA and that of all her friends and make clones for his 3D game. A younger version of the old man appears beside a bed and strips down, beckoning her to come to bed with him. The old man tells her that the final stage is the fulfillment of his deepest wish and he tells her to succumb to her destiny. Instead, Mitsuko attacks the younger man, screaming at him to stop playing with girls like toys. She rips one of the pillows, showering the room with feathers. Remembering what Sur said about tricking fate, she then commits suicide by stabbing herself, to the shock of both the old man and his younger self. Finding herself once again in the beginning of each of the three game scenarios, she simultaneously commits suicide on the bus, at the wedding chapel, and during the marathon before any of the violent scenarios can begin. Mitsuko then awakens alone in a field of white snow, gets up, and runs away, realizing that "it's over now."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cast ==\u000aReina Triendl as Mitsuko\u000aMariko Shinoda as Keiko\u000aErina Mano as Izumi\u000aYuki Sakurai (\u685c\u4e95\u30e6\u30ad) as Aki\u000aMaryjun Takahashi\u000aSayaka Isoyama\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reception ==\u000aIn Variety, Richard Kuipers described Tag as "grindhouse meets arthouse", praising the acting and photography.

aVChanging Horses is the fifth album by the Scottish psychedelic folk group, the Incredible String Band (ISB), and was released in November 1969 on Elektra Records (see 1969 in music). The album saw the group continuing their use of unique instruments while integrating a standard musical structure. In addition, the album is seen as a transitional period in which the ISB shifted in musical textures, including early utilization of electric-based instruments.\u000aThis album also marks the point when the band openly gave up the use of drugs and joined the Church of Scientology. "White Bird" expresses the members' changing views in a shift that would affect the band's musical direction in the next decade. The creative differences between Heron and Williamson also continued with the album. Heron wrote two tracks while Williamson penned four on the album, but, in the first occurrence featured on an ISB album, the two had joint credits on the song, "Dust Be Diamonds". The two, despite being bandmates, typically composed whole tracks individually, so as to maintain their own separate musical identity. As they progressed, the two began to have influence on another's compositions, specifically the instrumental arrangements. They also confirmed their partners Licorice McKechnie and Rose Simpson had upheld larger roles in the band. This, along with the album cover, assembled the official quartet.\u000aThe album is dominated by two lengthy tracks, "White Bird", by Mike Heron, and "Creation", by Robin Williamson. The two songs comprise more than half of the 50 minute length of the album; lyrics are given only for the pair of songs. Changing Horses comes after the success the band achieved in 1968 with their albums, The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter and Wee Tam and the Big Huge. The ISB was one of the top folk groups in England, and, despite respectable chart listings, the album was generally received as a disappointment in comparison to the band's earlier work. Still, "Creation" and "White Bird" are deemed to be instrumental, and lyrical highlights of the band's music catalogue as they displayed several of the group's strengths.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Background ==\u000aThe Incredible String Band spent much of 1969 touring in the UK and the United States. Now a four-piece band, with McKechnie and Simpson officially in the fold, the ISB improved in their communication with their audience, an aspect they attempted to improve upon after their conversion to Scientology. The band undertook extensive studies of spirituality and philosophy as a way of self-analyzing themselves, and their religious conversion was a part of the process. Changing Horses reflected upon these developments and their abstinence from the use of drugs, which did not change the group's complexity, but the structure differed from the Wee Tam album. Wee Tam, and earlier efforts, had a basis of producing compositions where the message would vary, depending on the individual's perception of it, while Changing Horses established more coherent tracks with an almost specified meaning. The album, in some sorts, is noted as the band's transitional period from psychedelic folk to British folk rock, and even early progressive rock influences. On the album's tracks, the electric guitar was involved in the proceedings. This trend came full circle for the band in recordings of the following decade. The group, despite all the changes, still held some aspects of the counter-culture such as their way of communal living at their farmhouse in Pembrokeshire. As Heron later confirmed, "the album which marked our conversion, if you will, was Changing Horses".\u000aJoe Boyd, the band's longtime record producer, returned for the album. Boyd was flexible with the group's creative development, and rarely interfered with their process. His approach to the ISB's output was to allow them to decide what material appeared on the final product as Boyd, who also produced other extravagant acts like Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, encouraged unique musical compositions. Williamson later praised Boyd saying, "He used to just sort of get you in there. And if you said to him, 'Well I would like such and such' he would get it for you. But otherwise, just let you get on with it". Boyd, noticing the group's change and potential faults, attempted to intervene, but, in the end, continued allowing the band to develop their new concepts. Another major production member was John Wood, sound engineer at Sound Techniques. The studio initially included only basic recording equipment not yet able to showcase the band's full musical inventiveness. By their third album, the facilities held 16-tracks, allowing the group to overdub and jump tracks to generate their multi-instrumental sound.\u000aRecording took place on an intermittent basis in between gaps in the ISB's summer touring schedule. Much of their recording was completed in Sound Techniques, except for "Big Ted", which was recorded in New York City. Lyrically, the compositions went in the same vein as earlier developments regarding perceptions and interpretations of life, religion, and mythology. That concept was altered slightly by the band's conversion to their new religion as they were consciously aware of creating effective communication. The recordings had an added sense of accessibility that served as a contrast to their more complex takes on themes in the group's previous compositions. Instrumentally, the band still utilized exotic instruments derived from eastern and African influences that were most evident on the album's two longest tracks. Complexity, too, highlighted the instrumentals though the multi-tracking was not as heavily employed or necessary as on past efforts.\u000aWith McKechnie and Simpson sharing larger roles in the band, they too were performing, instrumentally, along with their backing vocals duties. Another surprising development resulting from the album was Simpson's emergence as a prominent member in the sessions after improving upon her capability on the bass guitar. Prior to the recording of Changing Horses, Simpson was not credited as a bass player on a single track. On this album, however, Simpson was featured as playing the bass guitar on every composition that included instruments. McKechnie, for that reason, dealt with several different instruments in order to retain a presence in the studio. Two guest musicians and close associates with the ISB, Ivan Pawle and Walter Gundy, appear on the album, contributing to "Big Ted" and "Creation", respectively. Several non-vinyl compositions were also produced during recording sessions. Two tracks, "Veshengro" and "All Writ Down", later appeared on the Be Glad for the Song Has No Ending soundtrack in 1971, but numerous songs have yet to be released officially.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Release ==\u000aChanging Horses was released on the Elektra label (catalogue number EKS-74057 on stereo, Y8K8 42037 on 8-track) in November 1969. The cover photo by Janet Shankman (Williamson's future wife) featured all four band members, for the first time as a group, perched in a tree, grinning, to express a lighter mood. The album's back cover offered lyrics to "Creation", and individual song credits. Inside there is original artwork by Williamson on the left side, and Heron on the right. Lyrics for "White Bird" are assorted into Heron's artwork. A single, "Big Ted" b/w "All Writ Down", was released to the UK a month prior to the album's release, but failed to chart. The "Big Ted" song featured on the single was an edited version of the album track. Single releases were a relatively rare occurrence for the band who only issued two others up to that point. The album was more financially successful than its predecessor, and on the UK Albums Charts it peaked at number 30 before dropping off the charts in a week. In the US it reached number 166 on the Billboard 200, spending three weeks on the charts. Despite the band's effort to experiment musically, it has been cited that Changing Horses was a missed opportunity after their public media exposure at the Woodstock Festival earlier in the year.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Reissues ===\u000aChanging Horses was reissued to the UK by Hannibal Records on its first compact disc release in 1993. The CD version included a 16-page liner note booklet, along with a complete set of lyrics for all the tracks. In September 2002, a single disc distributed by Collector's Choice Records featured the album along with the band's 1970 album, I Looked Up. Two further re-releases were issued in the US and Japan on September 20, 2006.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Track listing ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Single ==\u000a"Big Ted" b/w "All Writ Down" (Elektra 45074) October 1969, UK\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personnel ==\u000aRobin Williamson - lead vocals ("Big Ted", "Dust Be Diamonds", "Mr. & Mrs.", "Creation"), guitar ("Mr. & Mrs.", "Creation"), washboard ("Big Ted"), piano ("Big Ted"), flute ("White Bird"), sarangi ("White Bird"), Chinese banjo ("White Bird"), percussion ("White Bird", "Dust Be Diamonds", "Mr. & Mrs."), electric guitar ("Dust Be Diamonds"), organ ("Mr. & Mrs."), gimbri ("Creation"), violin ("Creation"), backing vocals ("White Bird")\u000aMike Heron - lead vocals ("White Bird"), electric guitar ("Big Ted", "Mr. & Mrs."), piano ("Big Ted"), guitar ("White Bird", "Dust Be Diamonds"), vibraphone ("Dust Be Diamonds"), percussion ("Mr. & Mrs.", "Creation"), sitar ("Creation"), mandolin ("Creation"), backing vocals ("Big Ted", "Mr. & Mrs.", "Creation")\u000aLicorice McKechnie - guitar ("Big Ted"), organ ("White Bird", "Dust Be Diamonds", "Mr. & Mrs."), kazoo ("Dust Be Diamonds", "Creation"), percussion ("Creation"), backing vocals ("Big Ted", "White Bird", "Mr. & Mrs.", "Creation")\u000aRose Simpson - bass guitar ("Big Ted", "White Bird", "Dust Be Diamonds", "Mr. & Mrs.", "Creation"), percussion ("Creation"), backing vocals ("Big Ted", "White Bird", "Mr. & Mrs.", "Creation")\u000aNote\u000a"Sleepers Awake!" features vocal harmonies by all band members with no instruments.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Additional musicians ===\u000aWalter Gundy - harmonica on "Big Ted"\u000aIvan Pawle - organ, piano on "Creation" (appears courtesy of Dr. Strangely Strange)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Chart positions ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVSarah L. Sheppard "Sally" Young (1905 \u2013 February 27, 1970) was an American bridge player from Philadelphia who won many important tournaments in the 1930s and 1940s. She was the first woman and 17th player to achieve the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) rank of Life Master (ACBL Life Master).\u000aYoung was born in Pennsylvania, one of eight children born to George and Marcella Sheppard (née Stehr). Her paternal grandparents were born in Ireland, and her mother's grandparents were born in England. Young began playing bridge at 15 and was self taught until Charles Goren took her under his tutelage. Young was one of several strong players from the Philadelphia area who contended for "national championships" (ACBL) during the 1930s\u201340s\u2014including her four 1939 Reisinger teammates, below.\u000aWith John R. Crawford, Goren, and Charles J. Solomon, Young won the Chicago Trophy (now Reisinger) teams-of-four championship in 1937, 1938, and 1939. (They played as a fivesome with B. Jay Becker in 1939.) In 1947 she teamed with three other women\u2014Jane Jaeger, Kay Rhodes and Paula Ribner\u2014and they shared the title with two other teams. (The Reisinger does not break ties. It was the first of 6 ties in 85 renditions to 2013.) It remains the only win, albeit shared, for an all-women team\u2014the only win in North America in any major open teams competition.\u000aYoung and Helen Sobel won the annual North American women pairs championship (now Whitehead Women's Pairs) in 1938 and again in 1939. That year she became the first woman to achieve the rank of ACBL Life Master; Sobel became the second in 1941. (They were 17th and 25th overall, of whom the first twelve preceded ACBL.)\u000aFrom 1943 to 1946, Young teamed with Emily Folline, Helen Sobel, and Margaret Wagar to win the women teams (Sternberg Women's Board-a-Match Teams, now a knockout format named for Wagar) four years in a row.\u000aShe married Ralph C.

aVPhyllonorycter penangensis is a moth of the Gracillariidae family. It is known from Penang, Malaysia.\u000aThe wingspan is 6-6.3 mm.\u000aThe larvae feed on Rubus moluccanus. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a rather large, star-like mine occurring upon the upper side of the leaf. It is rather fiat, but its central area is slightly swollen in a circle. It never forms a tentiform type at maturity. The mining part of the leaf is whitish-green in the young stage and brownish in the mature stage. Pupation takes place inside the mine, usually at the swollen part. The cocoon is ellipsoidal, whitish, and covered with grains of frass.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVSion Causeway (also known as Duncan Causeway) is a major causeway in Bombay, India which connects Sion in Bombay with Kurla in Salsette. The construction of the causeway began in 1798 and was completed in 1805 by Jonathan Duncan, Governor of Bombay (1795\u20131811), at a cost of £5,037 (Rs. 50,370). In 1826, its breadth was doubled and improved at a further outlay of £4,000 (Rs. 40,000) A volcanic tract extends from Carnac Bunder to Sion Causeway, and forms the entire of the chain of hills bordering the north-eastenn end of the island from the Sewri Fort to Sion.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bombay and Salsette islands ==\u000a\u000aBombay city was originally an archipelago of seven islands of Bombay, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as Little Colaba). The Treaty of Bassein placed the islands into Portuguese possession in 1534. Charles II of England received possession of the islands in 1661 as the dowry of Catherine of Braganza. Charles II later leased the islands to the British East India Company in 1668. After the completion of the causeway, the villages of Sion in Bombay and Kurla in Salsette were connected. Accessibility considerably increased after construction of this causeway.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Architecture ==\u000aThe Sion causeway is 935 yards long and 24 feet wide, and the roadway is raised to a maximum height of nine feet above the swampy ground. The side walls are of plain stone and lime masonry with earth and stone filling between.\u000aAt the south end of the causeway is a tablet with the following inscription:\u000aThis causeway was begun in May 1798, and was finished in January 1805 during the administration of the Honourable Jonathan Duncan, Esquire. It cost Rs. 50,374. It was doubled in width, and other improvements added, in 1826, under the Government of-the Honourable Mountstuart Elphinstone, at a further cost of Rs. 40,000. The causeway was originally, constructed under the superintendence of Captain William Brooks, of the Engineers; and the additions and the improvements made in 1826 under that of Captain William A. Tate of the same corps\u000a\u000a\u000a== Transport ==\u000aIt is used at all seasons of the year, and, during the dry weather, there is a great traffic. Carts laden with cotton and coal for the Kurla Spinning and Weaving Mills, yarn and cloth from the mills, shell-lime, grass, stones, salt, and other articles, brought into Bombay from different parts of Thane, are carried over the causeway.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Toll ==\u000aA toll on the causeway used to yield a yearly revenue of £2700 (Rs. 27,000). The toll rates were: 1s. (8 as.) for a four-wheeled carriage with one or two horses; 6d. (4 as.) for a palanquin or for a loaded two-wheeled carriage drawn by two bullocks; 3d. (2 as.) for a two-wheeled carriage, loaded or empty, drawn by one bollock; 2s. (Re. 1) for an elephant; ¾d. (6 pies) for a camel, horse or bullock; \u215cd. (3 pies) for a donkey; and \u215bd. (1 pic) a head for swine, sheep, or goats. The custom duties which were levied for transport between Bombay and Salsette were also abolished after the construction of this causeway.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

With a minimum safe distance of only 10m, the GM-94 is well suited to close, room-to-room fighting. Its simple design and operation allows it to operate in dusty and dirty environments and even after being immersed in water.\u000aThe launcher is capable of firing high explosive, frag, thermobaric, smoke and tear gas canisters, rubber slugs and other non-lethal payloads.\u000aIn June 2005, GM-94 with thermobaric VGM-93 ammunition was adopted by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. In October 2007, the Russian armed forces adopted a new launcher designated LPO-97 developed in the KBP Instrument Design Bureau on the basis of the GM-94 with a thermobaric grenade, in 2008 GM-94 adopted for the branches of the Federal Security Service. Though the launcher was intended for use by Russian security forces, the GM-94 has been spotted as far afield as Kazakhstan and Libya.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Users ==\u000a Soviet Union\u000a Russian Federation\u000a Ukraine\u000a Kazakhstan\u000a Libya\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aDP-64\u000aRGM-40 Kastet\u000aRGS-50M\u000aRGSh-30\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare (UDAW) is a proposed inter-governmental agreement to recognise that animals are sentient, to prevent cruelty and reduce suffering, and to promote standards on the welfare of animals such as farm animals, companion animals, animals in scientific research, draught animals, wildlife and animals in recreation.\u000aIt is proposed that a UDAW be adopted by the United Nations. If endorsed by the UN (as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was) the UDAW would be a non-binding set of principles that acknowledges the importance of the sentience of animals and human responsibilities towards them. The principles were designed to encourage and enable national governments to introduce and improve animal protection legislation and initiatives.\u000aIt has been argued that a UDAW is consistent with, and could help secure the achievement of, the UN Millennium Development Goals. and the subsequent sustainable development goals. The declaration as of October 2014 has the support, in principle, of 46 countries and of ministries from 17 further countries. More than 2.5 million people from a wide variety of UN Member States have supported the public campaign.\u000aThis should not be confused with The Declaration of Animal Rights (2011) or the Universal Charter of the Rights of Other Species (2000).\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe UDAW was conceived in 2000 by a group of animal welfare organizations including World Animal Protection, (formerly the World Society for the Protection of Animals) which now acts as its Secretariat. It is supported by a planning group including Compassion in World Farming, Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and the Humane Society of the United States.\u000aIn 2003, the Manila Conference on Animal Welfare was attended by 19 government delegations with the European Council, United States and Saipan as observers. A foundation text with core principles for a UDAW was agreed.\u000aIn 2005, the UDAW inter-governmental steering committee was formed and representatives of the governments of Kenya, India, Costa Rica, Czech Republic and the Republic of the Philippines agreed to champion the initiative. They lead a group of governments whose officials have stated support in the following years, including Cambodia, Fiji, Latvia, Lithuania, New Zealand, Poland, Slovenia, Tanzania, and the UK.\u000aIn May 2007, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) passed a resolution supporting the development of a UDAW in principle, as did the Commonwealth Veterinary Association (CVA) and the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe (FVE). In August 2008, the national veterinary associations of Chile, New Zealand, the UK, the Philippines, Thailand and Colombia have all given public backing for a UDAW.\u000aIn April 2008, Eric Martlew MP put forward an early day motion in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom that \u201ccalls upon the Government to give its full and publicly-stated support for this initiative, including active support within the European Union and the United Nations.\u201d\u000aThe Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations recognised UDAW in 2009, integrating animal welfare into its poverty alleviation, disaster relief and livestock development programmes and stating in a report of an expert meeting that, \u201cThe Draft Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare (World Animal Protection 2007)\u2026 provides a valuable guiding philosophy for efforts to improve the welfare of animals\u201d. And, in the same year, the Council of the European Union discussed the proposal for a Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare and agreed that, \u201canimal welfare is an issue of common concern and importance\u201d It encouraged the EU Commission \u201cto support and initiate further international initiatives to raise awareness and create a greater consensus on animal welfare\u201d. It also invited the Member States and the Commission, within their respective competencies, \u201cto support, in principle, the UDAW initiative in the relevant international fora\u201d.\u000aThere have been several drafts of the declaration, with the most recent proposed in 2014. This draft takes into account feedback from UN Member States, international organisations and non-governmental organisations. It develops the earlier draft arising from the Manila conference on animal welfare (2003) and the Costa Rica draft (2005) which incorporated suggestions made by the Steering Committee.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Historical background ===\u000aThe lack of success in shaping internationally binding charters on animal rights has not been for want of trying. People in modern times have attempted to identify and advance the rights of animals at least since the 18th century. Credit usually goes to Henry Stephens Salt (1851\u20131939) for writing the first book on animal rights, published in 1892 and subsequently. And Salt traces efforts back to John Lawrence (1753\u20131839), one of the earliest modern writers on animal rights and welfare. Lawrence argued in his 1796 book, A Philosophical and Practical Treatise on Horses and the Moral Duties of Man Towards Brute Creation (T N Longman: London), that we have to care for animals and common law should support this principle in practice\u000aThe 20th century saw a number of international declarations supporting animal rights. Perhaps the most prominent venture was the announcement (The Times, 17 October) in 1978 at the United Nation\u2019s Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) headquarters in Paris of the Universal Declaration of Animal Rights. Among the Declaration's pronouncements were that all animals have the same rights to existence, no animal shall be ill-treated or subject to cruelty, animals shall command the protection of law, and dead animals shall be treated with respect. The Declaration, however, waned and faded away before it could reach significant levels of international agreement.\u000aMore recently some of the world's leading animal welfare organisations have started campaigning for the United Nations to adopt a new declaration. This time the declaration is on the welfare of animals: the Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare. Why welfare and not rights? Probably because welfare is a softer option than rights and therefore easier for people to accept. Thus it has a better chance of endorsement and of enduring.\u000aThe animal organisations behind this new declaration envisage that signatory countries to the document will recognise animals as sentient beings. They hope their declaration will make animal welfare an important global issue, pioneer the way for legally binding international agreements on animal welfare and hasten a better deal for animals worldwide. Their declaration would also underscore the importance of animal welfare as part of the moral development of humanity. So far a number of United Nations member states are acting as a steering group to advance the initiative at the UN. See Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare, below, for a draft copy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Overview of the proposed declaration ==\u000aA draft text of the declaration, most recently updated by the OIE in 2014 provides a basis for states and peoples to work to improve their national animal welfare legislation, introduce animal welfare legislation in countries where it does not currently exist, encourage those businesses which use animals to keep welfare at the forefront of their policies, link humanitarian, development and animal welfare agendas nationally and internationally, inspire positive change in public attitudes towards animal welfare.\u000aThe declaration calls for:\u000aRecognition that animals are living, sentient beings and therefore deserve due consideration and respect\u000aRecognition that animal welfare includes animal health and encompasses both the physical and psychological state of the animal and that good practices in animal welfare can have major benefits for humans and the environment\u000aRecognition that humans inhabit this planet with other species and other forms of life and that all forms of life co-exist within an interdependent ecosystem\u000aRecognition of the importance of the ongoing work of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) in setting global standards for animal welfare and that Member States should adopt all necessary measures to give effect to the principles of UDAW, including the implementation of these standards.\u000aAcknowledgment that many states already have a system of legal protection for animals, both domestic and wild and that the continued effectiveness of these systems must be ensured, with the development of better and more comprehensive animal welfare provisions\u000aAwareness that the Five Freedoms (freedom from hunger, thirst and malnutrition; freedom from fear and distress; freedom from physical and thermal discomfort; freedom from pain, injury and disease; and freedom to express normal patterns of behaviour) and the Three Rs (reduction in numbers of animals, refinement of experimental methods and replacement of animals with non-animal techniques) provide valuable guidance for the use of animals\u000aRecognition that the provisions contained in this declaration do not affect the rights of any state.\u000aThe principles of the declaration are:\u000aThe welfare of animals shall be a common objective for all states and all appropriate steps shall be taken by Member States to prevent cruelty to animals and to reduce their suffering.\u000aThe policies, legislation and standards of animal welfare attained by each state shall be promoted, recognized and observed by improved measures, nationally and internationally. Each member state should care for and treat animals in a humane and sustainable manner in accordance with the principles of the Declaration.\u000aAll appropriate steps shall be taken by states to prevent cruelty to animals and to reduce their suffering\u000aAppropriate policies, legislation and standards on the welfare of animals will be further developed and elaborated, such as those governing the use and management of farm animals, companion animals, animals in scientific research, draught animals, wildlife animals, and animals in recreation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Public campaign ==\u000aThe public campaign to gain support for a UDAW, branded \u2018Animals Matter\u2019, was launched in June 2006. It reached one million signatures in December 2007 with the President of Costa Rica, Sr. Oscar Arias, becoming the official one millionth signatory and hosting celebrations in San José, Costa Rica in March 2008. As of 2014, the petition has over 2.5 million signatures and support from people in a variety of UN member states.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aAnimal law\u000aAnimal welfare\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aAppleby, M.C. and Sherwood, L.

aVKirstin Blaise Lobato is a Nevada woman who was exonerated for the July 2001 murder and mutilation of Duran Bailey, a homeless man from St. Louis who was living in Las Vegas at the time of his death. At her first trial in May 2002, she was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to 40 to 100 years in prison. In a 2006 retrial, she was convicted of the lesser charges of voluntary manslaughter and sexual penetration of a dead body and sentenced to 13 to 45 years. Lobato's case gained significant notoriety due to the publication of new evidence, which some believe points to her innocence of the crime.\u000aOn December 29, 2017, Lobato was ordered to be released from the Nevada Department of Corrections. It was reported on Jan 2, 2018, that Lobato will spend another year in prison for an unrelated incident, yet on Jan 3 the same judge who had ordered Lobato's original release, ordered her released on that unrelated matter as well, citing time-served.\u000aLobato was released from the Clark County Detention Center at about 2 pm on January 3, 2018. After being imprisoned for 11 years and three months since her pre-trial bail was revoked following her convictions on October 6, 2006, Lobato told reporters she wanted to go "shopping" and get "coffee."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Accusations ==\u000aBeginning in late May 2001, Kirstin Lobato, then 18, began telling numerous friends in Las Vegas and her hometown of Panaca that a large black man tried to rape her at a Budget Suites Hotel on Boulder Highway in east Las Vegas. Lobato was consistent in telling these people that she fended off the attempted sexual assault by using a pocket knife she carried for self-defense, to try and cut her attacker's penis. From late May to the July 4, 2001 she told at least nine different people about the Budget Suites attack.\u000aOn July 8, 2001, the mutilated corpse of Duran Bailey, a homeless man, was found on the opposite side of Las Vegas. Lobato was charged with the crime more than ten days later, after one of Lobato's friends informed police of her account of the sexual assault that supposedly occurred two months before. During a police interrogation, Lobato acknowledged stabbing a man in the groin, and police believed this constituted a confession to Bailey's murder, while Lobato claimed to be describing her attack.\u000a\u000a\u000a== First trial ==\u000aWhile prosecutors expected Lobato to plead not guilty by reason of self-defense, Lobato denied committing the crime entirely; she even refused a plea deal offering a 3-year prison sentence on the charge of manslaughter. She insisted that she was at home in Panaca, Nevada, nearly 200 miles from Las Vegas, on July 8, 2001, and her family confirmed that. Her attorneys also attempted to discount her supposed confession. However, prosecutors contended that Lobato was a known methamphetamine user and that she killed Bailey during a dispute over sex and drugs. During the May 2002 trial, Lobato testified to her innocence, and her attorneys brought in experts who also stated that Lobato could not have committed the crime based on physical evidence, but Judge Valorie Vega suppressed much of the experts' testimony. In their closing statement, Lobato's attorneys compared her trial to the Salem witch trials. After deliberating through the night, the jury convicted Lobato of first-degree murder. On August 27, 2002, she was sentenced to 40 to 100 years in prison.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Appeals, second trial and ongoing litigation ==\u000aOver two years after her conviction, on September 3, 2004, Lobato's conviction was reversed; the Supreme Court of Nevada argued that her attorneys were unable to cross-examine a prosecution witness, who was a woman whom Lobato was incarcerated with while awaiting trial. Her case was remanded for a new trial. On October 6, 2006, she was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to 13 to 45 years in prison.\u000aLobato's appeal of her conviction was denied by the Supreme Court of Nevada in October 2009.\u000aIn May 2010, Lobato filed a writ of habeas corpus petition that asserted 79 grounds for a new trial. Among those was her claim of actual innocence based on new evidence discovered after her trial proving she was in Panaca, Nevada, during the time when Bailey was killed. Judge Vega denied Lobato's petition in June 2011. Lobato appealed that ruling to the Nevada Supreme Court on August 1, 2011.\u000aIn February 2011 Lobato filed a post-conviction petition for DNA testing of crime scene evidence. The Innocence Project agreed to pay for the testing if Lobato's petition was granted. The petition was opposed by the Clark County District Attorney's Office, and denied by Judge Vega. Lobato appealed that ruling to the Nevada Supreme Court, which on January 12, 2012 dismissed her appeal on the basis Judge Vega's ruling was not appealable under NRS 176.0918.\u000aAfter Lobato's DNA testing petition was denied, an online petition has called for the Nevada courts to test the crime scene evidence in Lobato's case, claiming it can prove she is an innocent person.\u000aA book about the case, entitled Kirstin Blaise Lobato's Unreasonable Conviction by Hans Sherrer was published in May 2008 by the Justice Institute, and a second edition in November 2010. As of March 17, 2015 more than 53,000 copies have been downloaded at no charge from the website, Justice Denied.\u000aRetired FBI agent Steve Moore, noted for his advocacy on behalf of Amanda Knox, has referred to the case documents in the Lobato case as, "...complete and utter bullshit."\u000aRetired FBI agent Moore believes that Duran Bailey might have been castrated and killed by another woman instead, who had claimed one week before that Bailey had raped her.\u000aAfter having been charged with misconduct and publicly reprimanded by the Nevada Commission on Judicial Discipline, Judge Vega, the judge in both of Lobato's trials, did not run for re-election in 2014 and stepped down from the bench in January 2015.\u000aOn September 9, 2014 the Nevada Supreme Court, sitting En banc, heard oral arguments related to Lobato's habeas petition. The case has been "Submitted for Decision.

aVShirley Kwan, Kwan Suk'E, or Kwan Suk Yee (simplified Chinese: \u5173\u6dd1\u6021; traditional Chinese: \u95dc\u6dd1\u6021; pinyin: Gu\u0101n Shúyí, born 15 August 1966) is an influential Cantopop singer from Hong Kong. Kwan first shot to fame in 1989 with the hit, "Happy Are Those In Love" (\u96e3\u5f97\u6709\u60c5\u4eba) and was widely popular throughout the early to mid-90s. She is noted for her distinct, whispery vocal style and known equally for singing mainstream ballads and more alternative songs.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aKwan was born in Hong Kong and moved to Los Angeles at the age of twelve. She studied fashion before venturing into the entertainment industry in 1986, at the age of 20.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Music career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1986-1988: Early years ===\u000aKwan had her first taste of the limelight in 1986 when she became one of twelve finalists in TVB's New Talent Singing Awards, along with Andy Hui and Leon Lai, but lost to both. Two years later, with the encouragement of a friend, she recorded a demo tape for the prestigious "Marine Blue" singing competition in Japan and won. She caught the eyes of record executives at Apollon and signed a contract, releasing two Japanese pop albums in two years. Kwan sang in both Japanese and English for these releases, and notably made her first and only rap vocals in the song "Borderless".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1989-1995: PolyGram period ===\u000aKwan's Marine Blue success in Japan quickly led to her discovery by PolyGram. In March 1989, Kwan released her debut Cantonese album "Winter Love" (\u51ac\u6200), with its R&B-influenced first single, "The Rebel" (\u53db\u9006\u6f22\u5b50).\u000aHer sophomore album, "Happy Are those in Love", would produce her first major hit with its title track, which immediately propelled Kwan into Hong Kong stardom. The song "Happy are Those in Love" was the theme song to a popular day-time drama series on TVB. It reached no. 1 on the TVB charts and was frequently requested in karaoke bars at the time. The album, which sold platinum, enjoyed huge chart success and spawned a further hit single, the up-tempo "Lovers Underneath the Stars" (\u661f\u7a7a\u4e0b\u7684\u6200\u4eba), with Kwan sweeping newcomer awards at all of the major year-end music award shows.\u000aThe following two years saw the release of four albums, in which Kwan started to develop a more individualistic style. After scoring another major pop hit in 1990 with \u611b\u6068\u7e8f\u7dbf, Kwan began incorporating elements from a wider variety of musical genres. Her 1991 album Love is Forever (\u6200\u4e00\u4e16\u7684\u611b) saw her exploring New Age music, with cover versions of songs by Gregorian and Michael Cretu. As a marketing strategy, PolyGram presented its title track, which was a cover version of "Once In A Life Time," back to back with the Gregorian original on the promotional disc that was sent out to radio DJs at the time. Kwan also covered Amina's 1991 winning Eurovision entry, "Le dernier qui a parle", rewritten by veteran lyricist Andrew Lam (\u6797\u654f\u9a44) as "Buddhist Chant" (\u68b5\u97f3), which became a surprising top 10 radio single.\u000aIn November 1993, Kwan released the platinum-selling album, "The Story of Shirley" (\u771f\u5047\u60c5\u8a71), which spawned the minor hit "Fake Love" (\u5047\u7684\u6200\u611b). The album signalled a change in vocal style, with a whispery delivery that featured more prominently than before, and which would become her trademark style.\u000aKwan further established her place as a cantopop diva with the album, "My Way", released in the summer of 1994. This would be the last album containing all original Cantonese material until Shirley's Era in 2009. Singles included the acid-jazz influenced "Death of a Legend" (\u901d\u53bb\u7684\u50b3\u5947) which sampled a riff from the Digable Planets' 1993 single "Rebirth of Slick," and the immensely popular ballad "Cuddling Underneath the Stars" (\u7e7e\u7da3\u661f\u5149\u4e0b), another of Kwan's major career hits, which won numerous song awards at the ceremonies that year. The album also featured two of Andrew Lam's techno and house inflected compositions "Anxiety" (\u7dca\u5f35) and "Out of This World" (\u9a5a\u4e16\u611f\u89ba), as well as another popular ballad "Farewell Love Song" (\u544a\u5225\u6200\u66f2). My Way, the cover of which featured Kwan in a new crew-cut look that has since become iconic, was one of the most celebrated in 1994, enjoying a high-degree of both commercial and critical success.\u000aWith increasing confidence in her musical style, Kwan asked producer Joseph Ip (\u8449\u5ee3\u6b0a) and eight different sound engineers to rearrange ten of her favourite cantopop songs which she handpicked for a covers album. The result was "'EX' All Time Favourites," released in February 1995, which featured covers of classics by Anita Mui, Leslie Cheung and Alan Tam, reworked and reinterpreted with Kwan's alternative musical influences and trademark, ethereal singing style. The lead single, a cover version of Teresa Teng's "Forget Him" rearranged by Donald Ashley, was featured in Wong Kar-wai's 1995 arthouse film Fallen Angels. The album sold three times platinum, and was selected in 2000 as one of the Top 20 Defining Chinese Albums of All Time for the book (\u807d\u898b2000\u5206\u4e4b100) by a jury of musicians which included Anthony Wong, Sandee Chan, Carl Wong and Lin Wei-Che.\u000aIn the summer of 1995, Kwan released her third compilation album, "Journey of Life" (\u4e16\u9014\u4e0a\u3000\u65b0\u66f2\uff0b\u7cbe\u9078), containing two new singles, "He Needs You, She Needs You" (\u4ed6\u9700\u8981\u4f60, \u5979\u9700\u8981\u4f60), a dreampop track which incorporated the traditional Chinese instrument erhu, and the minor hit, "Are There Real Friends in Life" (\u4eba\u751f\u53ef\u6709\u77e5\u5df1), a pop ballad which has since became a fan favourite.\u000aRiding on the success of a string of platinum-selling albums, Kwan held her first large-scale solo concert series, "The One and Only Shirley Kwan In Concert" (\u96e3\u5f97\u6709\u4e00\u500b\u95dc\u6dd1\u6021\u6f14\u5531\u6703), in June 1995 at the Hong Kong Coliseum.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1996-2000: Hiatus ===\u000aAfter seven years at PolyGram, Kwan's contract came to an end in June 1996. A final PolyGram studio album was initially scheduled for release in the summer, containing three American collaborations ("Infectious" [\u50b3\u67d3] and "Elusive Love" [\u611b\u96e3\u5c0b] written by Andy Goldmark; and "Mumbling" [\u81ea\u8a00\u81ea\u8a9e] by Suzanne Fountain) and seven other tracks. However, due to Kwan's departure, PolyGram released the material separately in 1997's compilation "Connection" (\u5fc3\u9748\u76f8\u901a) and 1998's EP "eZone".\u000aKwan spent the second half of the 90s mostly away from the public eye, but managed to strike up some significant collaborations with friends and fellow contemporaries Tats Lau and Anthony Wong Yiu Ming of the former Tat Ming Pair. The first of these included "Blessed Mary" (\u842c\u798f\u99ac\u5229\u4e9e), a duet with Wong satirising Hong Kong's materialism released in late 1995. This was followed by the Tats Lau collaboration "Cuddle 28800BPS" (\u7e7e\u7da328800BPS), a song dealing with cyber love, and a cover version of the gender-ambiguous Tat Ming classic "Forget He is She" (\u5fd8\u8a18\u4ed6\u662f\u5979) at their request, both in 1996. In 1997, Kwan lent her vocals to the theme song of a radio drama produced by Commercial Radio Hong Kong, "Take Me Out Dancing" (\u5e36\u6211\u53bb\u8df3\u821e) which featured a soprano backing vocal mixed with a thumping dance beat. In 1999, she held a "Music Is Live" concert organized by Commercial Radio.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2001-2002: BMG period ===\u000aAfter several years of inactivity, Kwan attempted a short comeback in 2001, signing a contract reportedly worth 8-million dollars with BMG Taiwan in a high-profile press conference. Working with well-known producers such as Anthony Bao (\u5305\u5c0f\u677e), Jamie Hsueh (\u859b\u5fe0\u9298), and Benjamin Lin (\u6797\u660e\u967d), she released one Mandarin album, Freezing Flame (\u51b7\u706b) in November, to critical acclaim. The album spawned two singles, "Freezing Flame" (\u51b7\u706b) and "Who" (\u662f\u8ab0) which featured a mix of string instruments and electronic elements. Although the initial contract was for 4 albums, this came to a halt In 2002, when Kwan had become pregnant and moved to Canada. It was in an interview with Mingpao in 2013, in which she revealed that BMG had not arranged for any recording sessions for more than a year after she gave birth, and this ultimately led to an early termination.\u000aIn 2003, she was requested by Eason Chan to record guest vocals for the track "Lies" (\u8b0a\u8a00) on his album Live for Today.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2005-2006: Music Nation period ===\u000aIn fall 2005, Kwan stepped into the recording studio once again and duet with music veteran Alan Tam in "Rekindle The Flame" (\u820a\u60c5\u5fa9\u71be), a Cantonese remake of the French ballad "J'ai murmure va-t-en". The news of Kwan making a comeback sent excitement through Hong Kong's airwaves, and "Rekindle" took the charts by storm, reaching number 1 on TVB, RTHK and Metro Radio.\u000aTwo months later, Kwan was signed to a contract with Music Nation Group (\u5927\u570b\u6587\u5316) by the famous producer, Frankie Lee Chun. The first single "About Me" (\u95dc\u65bc\u6211) saw Kwan reunited with lyrist Wyman Wong and long-time collaborators Joseph Ip and John Laudon. Supported by extensive airplay, "About Me" steadily climbed to the top of various radio charts, and its limited-release special edition CD sold out within a day.\u000aIn early February 2006, the eponymous EP "Shirley Kwan" was released, introducing the second brand new single, "Evolution" (\u9032\u5316\u8ad6). This coincided with the release of a 3CD-Karaoke plus DVD compilation by Universal Music (formally PolyGram), entitled "All About Shirley," which contained side projects and rare tracks dating back to the very beginning of her career in Japan.\u000a\u000aTo much anticipation, three comeback concerts, "Being Shirley On Stage" (\u95dc\u65bc\u6211 \u95dc\u6dd1\u6021\u6f14\u5531\u6703) were held in late February, at the legendary Hong Kong Coliseum. Performing her biggest hits in reverse chronological order, Kwan garnered positive reviews for the performance, which dominated entertainment headlines for a week. In the final encore, Kwan famously covered Eason Chan's "Today Next Year" (\u660e\u5e74\u4eca\u65e5) to a standing ovation, and a sing-a-long audience of 30, 000.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2007-2009: Star Entertainment period ===\u000aUpon completion of her contract with Music Nation, Kwan released two new songs in February 2007 as an independent artist for songwriter Keith Chan (\u9673\u8f1d\u967d)'s multimedia musical "12 faces of woman" (\u5341\u4e8c\u91d1\u91f5\u773e\u751f\u82b1) at the 2007 Hong Kong Arts Festival. This included the theme song "All Living Flowers" (\u773e\u751f\u82b1), which featured a mix of traditional Chinese and Western string instruments and a duet with Lee Heung Kam, "3000 Years Ago" (\u4e09\u5343\u5e74\u5f8c) which won the CASH Golden Sail Music Award for Best Alternative Song. In March, she released the single "Just Once" (\u53ea\u5f97\u4e00\u6b21), which was the theme song to a primetime TVB sitcom series and reached no. 1 on the TVB singles chart.\u000aIn June 2007, longtime friend and veteran producer Herman Ho (\u4f55\u54f2\u5716) recruited Shirley to his new company "Star Entertainment Ltd." (\u661f\u5a1b\u6a02\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), which is financed by Neway Karaoke Box (Neway\u5361\u62c9OK).\u000a2008 saw the release of two new singles, "Mountain, River" (\u5c71\u6c34) and (\u5929\u898f), followed by a new concert series, "Unexpected Shirley Kwan in Concert," which was held at the Hong Kong Coliseum on 24\u201325 April 2008.\u000aOn 15 June 2009, Kwan released the long-anticipated studio album, Shirley's Era, which contains all singles released in 2007\u20132008 as well as newly recorded material. This marked her first, full-length Cantonese studio album since 1994's All Time Favourites. The album produced the new single, "The Ends of the Earth" (\u5730\u76e1\u982d) which reached no. 1 on the 903 Commercial Radio charts.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2010-present: Independent ===\u000aIn October 2010, Kwan performed a live concert "One Starry Night: An Evening with Shirley Kwan" at the Venetian Arena in Macau, which featured mostly live covers of songs by other artists, such as Alan Tam's "Illusion" (\u5e7b\u5f71), Aaron Kwok's "Why did I let you go?" (\u6211\u70ba\u4f55\u8b93\u4f60\u8d70) and Faye Wong's "I'm Willing" (\u6211\u9858\u610f). She returned to the same stage on 12 November 2011 with long-time friend and collaborator Anthony Wong for the concert, "Anthony Wong x Shirley Kwan: Forget He is She Concert, Macau 2011."\u000aIn 2012, Kwan collaborated with Juno Mak on the single "Clavicle" (\u9396\u9aa8), which offers a mature example of her dream pop vocals and reached no. 1 on the Commercial Radio charts. In late 2012, she released the limited edition single, "Tourbillon" (\u9640\u98db\u8f2a), a cover of an Eason Chan song to polarizing reviews, but which was lauded by both the lyricist Wyman Wong and Anthony Wong for her authorial style.\u000aOn 02 February 2013, she held her 4th concert series at the Hong Kong Coliseum, "Philip Stein Your Favorite Shirley Kwan Suk'E In Concert," for two consecutive evenings. Later that year, she took part in a series of concerts, "Polygram Forever" for the newly revived label and recorded the theme song, "Coincidence" (\u5be6\u5c6c\u5de7\u5408) for the TVB series Always and Ever (\u60c5\u9006\u4e09\u4e16\u7de3).\u000aIn 2014, she recorded a duet with Mag Lam (\u661f\u6597\u7fa4) as the theme song to the TVB series Never Dance Alone (\u5973\u4eba\u4ff1\u6a02\u90e8).\u000aIn 2016, Kwan held a concert celebrating her 25th anniversary in the music industry, "The Best of Shirley Kwan 25 Live," at the Hong Kong Coliseum to rave reviews. Kwan dedicated the performance to her late mother, and broke down during her performance of the Hins Cheung cover, "Stay Young Forever" (\u9752\u6625\u5e38\u8a3b), prompting a memorable audience sing-along.\u000aOn 09 April 2017, she performed as a musical guest at the 36th Hong Kong Film awards amidst controversy of her recent arrest for intimidation and common assault. She performed a medley of theme songs including "Invincible" (\u7121\u6575) and "Let Me Stay by Your Side" (\u8b93\u6211\u7559\u5728\u4f60\u8eab\u908a) backed by Hanjin Tan, Supper Moment and The Interzone Collective, as well as presented the awards for Best Original Film Song and Best Original Score.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Studio albums ===\u000a1989: Winter Love (\u51ac\u6200)\u000a1989: Happy are Those in Love (\u96e3\u5f97\u6709\u60c5\u4eba)\u000a1989: Say Goodbye [Japanese]\u000a1990: True Love (\u771f\u60c5)\u000a1990: Borderless [Japanese / English]\u000a1990: Lost in the Night (\u591c\u8ff7\u5bae)\u000a1991: Golden Summer (\u91d1\u8272\u590f\u5b63)\u000a1991: Love is Forever (\u6200\u4e00\u4e16\u7684\u611b)\u000a1992: Creating an Illusion (\u88fd\u9020\u8ff7\u5922)\u000a1993: The Story of Shirley (\u771f\u5047\u60c5\u8a71)\u000a1994: Happy are Those in Love (\u96e3\u5f97\u6709\u60c5\u4eba) [Mandarin]\u000a1994: My Way\u000a1995: Ex' All Time Favourites\u000a1995: Bewildered (\u4e82\u4e86) [Mandarin]\u000a2001: Freezing Flame (\u51b7\u706b) [Mandarin]\u000a2009: Shirley's Era\u000a\u000a\u000a=== EPs ===\u000a1998: eZone\u000a2006: Shirley Kwan\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Compilations ===\u000a1991: Montage\u000a1993: Montage II\u000a1995: Journey of Life (\u4e16\u9014\u4e0a \u65b0\u66f2+\u7cbe\u9078)\u000a1997: Telepathic Connection (\u5fc3\u9748\u76f8\u901a \u65b0\u66f2+\u7cbe\u9078)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Filmography ==\u000aIn early 1997, Kwan was asked by Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai to star in his film Happy Together. She was flown to Argentina in five days' notice and ended up spending more than two months filming. Starring opposite Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Chang Chen, Kwan played Leung's mysterious and lonely secret admirer and also recorded a cover of Caetano Veloso's "Cucurucucu Paloma" (Song of Dove) for the film's soundtrack. However, her scenes were all deleted from the final version of the film, for which Wong later went on to win Best Director at the Cannes. It took another three years for Kwan's scenes to surface, when they were included in the making-of documentary, Buenos Aires Zero Degrees (\u5e03\u5b9c\u8afe\u65af\u827e\u5229\u65af\u4e4b\u651d\u6c0f\u96f6\u5ea6). The documentary premiered at the 2000 Berlin International Film Festival out of competition, and was also shown at the 2000 Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards in Taiwan.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aKwan is a single mother and gave birth to her son in January 2002 in Canada. Despite rumors involving Eric Tsang as the father, Kwan has never disclosed the true paternity of her child and insists only that they had met in Canada, and is not someone in the entertainment business. Kwan seems to have broken her silence in 2014 when she posted a photo of Zuri Rinpoche 8th on her instagram, with a caption claiming him to be the true father of her child. \u000aIn the past, Kwan has been romantically linked to Michael Chow (1992-96), and Hacken Lee.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Controversies ===\u000aIn September 2012, Kwan posted a suicidal message on facebook. She was incommunicado for roughly thirty-six hours before contacting her younger sister to confirm her safety.\u000aIn October 2016, Kwan was rescued from the waters off Discovery Bay. She was walking along the shore with a female friend, who had reportedly told officers that she was unhappy from work and had walked down to the sea for a swim. \u000aIn May 2017, Kwan was charged with one count of intimidation and one count of common assault for an altercation that took place with a hotel staff earlier in March.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Concerts ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Awards ==\u000a1988\u000aMarine Blue Singing Competition, Japan\u000a\u000a1989\u000aRTHK 12th Top 10 Gold Song Awards - Best Newcomer (Silver)\u000aCASH Golden Sail Music Awards - Best Chinese (Pop) Song: "Happy are Those in Love" (\u96e3\u5f97\u6709\u60c5\u4eba)\u000aJade Solid Gold 2nd Seasonal Awards - "Happy are Those in Love"\u000aJade Solid Gold 4th Seasonal Awards - "Lovers Underneath the Stars" (\u661f\u7a7a\u4e0b\u7684\u6200\u4eba)\u000aJade Solid Gold Best 10 Awards Presentation - Song Award: "Happy are Those in Love"\u000aJade Solid Gold Best 10 Awards Presentation - Most Popular Newcomer\u000aCommercial Radio Hong Kong Ultimate Song Chart Awards - Best Female Newcomer (Gold)\u000a\u000a1990\u000aJade Solid Gold 2nd Seasonal Awards - (\u611b\u6068\u7e8f\u7dbf)\u000aJade Solid Gold Best 10 Awards Presentation - Song Award: (\u611b\u6068\u7e8f\u7dbf)\u000a\u000a1991\u000aJade Solid Gold 1st Seasonal Awards - "Lost in the Night" (\u591c\u8ff7\u5bae)\u000aJade Solid Gold 3rd Seasonal Awards - (\u4e00\u5207\u4e5f\u9858\u610f)\u000a\u000a1992\u000aJade Solid Gold 1st Seasonal Awards - "Love is Forever" (\u6200\u4e00\u4e16\u7684\u611b)\u000aCRHK Ultimate Song Chart Awards - Ultimate Female Singer (Bronze)\u000aMetro Radio Hit Music Awards - Breakthrough Female Singer\u000aMetro Radio Hit Music Awards - Hit Female Singer (Bronze)\u000a\u000a1993\u000aJade Solid Gold 3rd Seasonal Awards - "Summer Party" (\u71b1\u529b\u7bc0\u62cd Wou Bom Ba)\u000aJade Solid Gold 4th Seasonal Awards - "Fake Love" (\u5047\u7684\u6200\u611b)\u000aJade Solid Gold Best 10 Awards Presentation - Best Music Video: "Summer Party" (\u71b1\u529b\u7bc0\u62cd Wou Bom Ba)\u000a\u000a1994\u000a1st Annual Hong Kong Record Design Awards - Best Hairstyle: My Way\u000aRTHK 17th Top 10 Gold Song Awards - Song Award: "Cuddling Under the Stars" (\u7e7e\u7da3\u661f\u5149\u4e0b)\u000aMetro Radio Hit Music Awards - Song Award: "Cuddling Under the Stars"\u000aJade Solid Gold 3rd Seasonal Awards - "Cuddling Under the Stars"\u000aJade Solid Gold Best 10 Awards Presentation - Song Award: "Cuddling Under the Stars"\u000a\u000a1995\u000aJade Solid Gold 1st Seasonal Awards - "Forget Him" (\u5fd8\u8a18\u4ed6)\u000aJade Solid Gold 3rd Seasonal Awards - "Are There Soulmates in Life?"

aVGilmore Township is a civil township of Isabella County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,376 at the 2000 census.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aGilmore Township was organized in 1870.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geography ==\u000aAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 36.1 square miles (93 km2), of which 35.7 square miles (92 km2) is land and 0.3 square miles (0.78 km2) (0.94%) is water.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Demographics ==\u000aAs of the census of 2000, there were 1,376 people, 511 households, and 400 families residing in the township. The population density was 38.5 per square mile (14.9/km²). There were 742 housing units at an average density of 20.8 per square mile (8.0/km²). The racial makeup of the township was 96.37% White, 0.07% African American, 1.45% Native American, 0.15% Asian, 1.16% from other races, and 0.80% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.63% of the population.\u000aThere were 511 households out of which 29.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 68.5% were married couples living together, 6.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 21.7% were non-families. 16.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 6.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.66 and the average family size was 2.91.\u000aIn the township the population was spread out with 24.3% under the age of 18, 6.5% from 18 to 24, 28.1% from 25 to 44, 27.0% from 45 to 64, and 14.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females there were 100.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.2 males.\u000aThe median income for a household in the township was $37,000, and the median income for a family was $39,911. Males had a median income of $30,179 versus $23,194 for females. The per capita income for the township was $16,277. About 6.6% of families and 9.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.4% of those under age 18 and 7.6% of those age 65 or over.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Notes ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Sources ===\u000aRomig, Walter (October 1, 1986) [1973].

aVThis is a list of crossings of the Eel River, a 200-mile (320 km) river flowing from the Coast Range to its mouth on the North Coast of the U.S. state of California. It also includes dry crossings and earthfills (culverts). Crossings are listed proceeding upstream.\u000aThe Eel River begins near Bald Mountain, near Lake Pillsbury, and flows through that lake and flows north to the ocean near Rio Dell, where it spills into a river delta and an estuary. Along its course, it receives the Middle Fork at Dos Rios from the east, the North Fork also from the east, the South Fork at Weott from the southwest, and the Van Duzen River shortly downstream from the northeast. In total, the river drains about 3,684 square miles (9,540 km2).

aVPerjury is the name of an offence under the Criminal Code (which is applicable in the Southern states of Nigeria). The offence of false evidence under the Penal Code (which is applicable in the Northern states of Nigeria) is equivalent.\u000aEvidence is the corner stone of all legal proceedings. It is therefore, of great significance, for its sanctity to be protected. A judge or magistrate before whom the legal contest is fought is intrinsically unconnected with the facts which led to the dispute. His ability to resolve the dispute based on the facts as presented by the disputants depends to a large extent on the quality of evidence adduced by the parties. Assigning probative value on the evidence of the disputants and, their witnesses, equally depend on the forensic skills of the trial court in observing the demeanours of those witnesses. The basis for the proscription of offences relating to perjury or false evidence is underscored by the inherent danger in wrongful conviction or wrongful acquittal where the evidence adduced by the parties, were false.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Offence of perjury under the Criminal Code ==\u000aThe offence of perjury is created by section 117 of the Criminal Code which reads:\u000a\u000aAny person who, in any judicial proceeding, or for the purpose of instituting any judicial proceeding, knowingly gives false testimony touching any matter which is material to any question then depending in that proceeding, or intended to be raised in that proceeding, is guilty of an offence, which is called perjury.\u000aIt is immaterial whether the testimony is given on oath or under any other sanction authorised by law.\u000aThe forms and ceremonies used in administering the oath or in otherwise binding the person giving the testimony to speak the truth are immaterial, if he assent to the forms and ceremonies actually used.\u000aIt is immaterial whether the false testimony is given orally or in writing. It is immaterial whether the court or tribunal is properly constituted, or is held in the proper place, or not, if it actually acts as a court or tribunal in the proceeding in which the testimony is given.\u000aIt is immaterial whether the person who gives the testimony is a competent witness or not, or whether the testimony is admissible in the proceeding or not.\u000aThe offender cannot be arrested without warrant.\u000a\u000a"Judicial proceeding"\u000aSection 113 of the Criminal Code reads:\u000a\u000aIn this chapter, the term "judicial proceeding" includes any proceeding had or taken in or before any court, tribunal, commission of inquiry, or person, in which evidence may or may not be taken on oath.\u000a\u000aCorroboration\u000aSection 119 of the Criminal Code reads:\u000a\u000aA person cannot be convicted of committing perjury, or of counselling or procuring the commission of perjury, upon the uncorroborated testimony of one witness.\u000a\u000aIn R Threlfall, it was held that section 13 of the Perjury Act 1911 imposes a requirement that the assignment of perjury must be proved or corroborated with two witnesses, or by one witness with proof of other material and relevant facts substantially confirming his testimony. In R v Mayhew a letter written by the defendant contradicting his sworn evidence is corroboration. The corroborated fact upon which the assignment is based, must be relative to that part of the matter sworn which is material to the matter before the court at the time the oath was taken.\u000aSentence\u000aSection 118 of the Criminal Code reads:\u000a\u000aAny person who commits perjury is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.\u000aIf the offender commits the offence in order to procure the conviction of another person for an offence punishable with death or with imprisonment for life, he is liable to imprisonment for life.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Classification of perjury under Nigerian law ==\u000aNigerian penal legislation classifies offences affecting evidence e.g. (for example) false evidence, perjury and, fabricating evidence in exactly the same way and, punishment for all the grades of offences appears to be based on the enormity of the evil, which will follow, consequent upon the giving of such false evidence. The offence of perjury is restricted as it was under common law to the case of forensic false evidence. This offence is committed by a witness, lawfully \u2018sworn\u2019 in judicial proceedings, which makes a material statement, which he knows to be false, or without belief in its truth. The word \u2018oath\u2019 according to Turner is not limited to religious oaths, but includes the taking of legal affirmation or declaration. Oath as synonym of sworn is defined by section 36 of the Penal Code thus: \u2018The word \u2018oath\u2019 includes a solemn affirmation substituted by law for an oath, and any declaration required or authorized by law to be made before a Public Servant or to be used for the purpose of proof, whether in a Court of Justice or not.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u000a=== False oaths in non-judicial proceedings ===\u000aIn the classification of perjury, the Criminal Code, punishes every falsehood whether in judicial proceedings, or sworn or not, in exactly the same way. This tends to suggest that the Criminal Code punishes telling lies simpliciter and, lies told outside the confines of a Court of Law, even though, not sworn, are brought within the classification of perjury or false evidence. Under the Penal Code classification, such evidence must have been given under oath or under express provision of law compelling a person to state the truth. But having regard to section 36 of the same Code, such statement may be made in order to proof a particular fact in a Court of Law or not. The Criminal Code in classifying false evidence or the offence of perjury made no distinction between statements made under oath; under the Penal Code, if the statement is made in a judicial proceeding oath is a sine qua non for the statement to assume the character of false evidence or perjury, if its falsehood is proved. Under section 1 (1) of the English Perjury Act 1911, the statement to amount to perjury must have been made under oath. Under these laws it is irrelevant whether or not the witness\u2019s statement is false at all. The witness renders himself liable to punishment by simply making assertions, false or true, which he does not positively believe to be true. In the words of Turner \u2018a man who tells the truth quite unintentionally is morally a liar.\u2019 This proposition was exemplified by the conviction of a Jewish juryman who concurred in a verdict that Christ was born of a virgin, was held to have committed perjury, whilst his Christian colleague were found not to be guilty.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Perjury or false evidence ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Definition ===\u000aSection 156 of the Penal Code defines giving false evidence thusly:\u000a\u000aWhoever, being legally bound by an oath or by any express provision of law to state the truth or being bound by law to make declaration upon any subject, makes any statement, verbally or otherwise, which is false in a material particular and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, is said to give false evidence.\u000a\u000aThe offence is defined under section 329 of the Sokoto State Shariah Penal Code, thus "whoever makes any statement, verbally or otherwise, which is false in a material particular and which he either know or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, is said to give false evidence."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Elements ==\u000aThe following matters may be regarded as the elements of the offence:\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Lawfully bound on oath ===\u000aIt seems that under the Nigerian Penal Code, for a witness to be prosecuted for giving false evidence, his testimony must be required by law to be on oath and, such testimony may be verbal or otherwise. But having regard to section 36 of the same Penal Code as noted earlier, evidence given under an affirmation or solemn declaration is also regarded as evidence given on oath. In interpreting the term \u2018By an oath\u2019 under section 191 of the Indian Penal Code, which has same wording with section 156 of the Penal Code, Thakore and Vakil apparently referring to an Indian court\u2019s decision, argued that an oath or solemn affirmation is not a sine qua non to the offence of perjury or giving false evidence. This reasoning may be correct but it is submitted that such a person must either legally be bound by an oath or by express provision of the law to state the truth or must be bound by law to make declaration. If otherwise, it is doubtful if a court of justice under the Nigerian Penal Code jurisdiction can reasonably find an accused guilty for the offence of giving false evidence for statements not made under those circumstances.\u000aWith regard to the competence of the court before which the oath or affirmation is given the Penal Code is silent on this. However, if the position in the Indian Penal Code is to be used as a guide for section 156 of the Penal Code, it means that if the oath was administered by a court that has no jurisdiction over the case in which the false evidence occurred, the proceeding will be coram non judice.\u000aUnder section 117 of the Criminal Code, it is immaterial that the court, tribunal, commission of inquiry or person before whom the oath was administered is properly constituted, or held in the proper place, provided that the court or tribunal, commission of inquiry or person acted as such in the proceeding in which the testimony is given. This seems to suggest that under the Criminal Code, perjury may be committed though the court had no jurisdiction in the particular case in which the statement was made.\u000aThe position under the Nigerian Penal Code and, that of the Indian Penal Code is consistent with the position under common law, where it used to be a requirement that the oath must have been taken before a competent jurisdiction, that is before same person or persons authorized by English law to take cognizance of the proceeding in or for which the oath is given, and administer the oath. It must be pointed out that under the Penal Code, even if the oath is improperly administered by an incompetent person, the offence is still committed, if the person who made the false statement were bound by an \u2018express provision of the law to state the truth.\u2019\u000aTurner enumerated those instances under common law, when the absence of \u2018competent jurisdiction\u2019 will result to the administration of oath on a witness being declared invalid, hence could not afford grounds for the prosecution of any person for perjury:\u000aThus a false oath taken in a court of requests, in a matter concerning lands, was held not to be indictable, that court having no jurisdiction in such cases. The court must be properly constituted and the evidence must be taken before person or persons constituting the court. And perjury could not be assigned on an oath taken before persons acting merely in a private capacity, or before those who take upon them to administer oaths of a public nature, without legal authority for their so doing, or before those who are legally authorized to administer some kinds of oaths but not those which happen to be taken before them, or even before those who take upon them to administer justice by virtue of an authority colourable, but in truth unwarrantable and merely void\u2026\u000a\u2018Judicial proceeding\u2019 is defined by section 9 of the Penal Code thus: \u2018judicial proceedings include any proceeding in the court which it is lawful to take evidence on oath.\u2019 Section 180 of the Evidence Act dealing with taking of oral evidence, provides that \u2018save as otherwise provided in section 182 and 183 of this Act all oral evidence in any judicial proceedings must be given upon oath or affirmation administered in accordance with the provisions of the Oath Act.\u2019 Section 229 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that \u2018Every witness giving evidence in any inquiry or trial under this Criminal Procedure Code may be called upon to take an oath or make a solemn affirmation that he will speak the truth.\u2019\u000aSub-section 2 of section 229 of the same Code states:\u000a\u000aThe evidence of any person, who by reason of youth or ignorance or otherwise is in the opinion of the court unable to understand the nature of an oath, may be received without the taking of an oath or making of an affirmation if in the opinion of the court he is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of the evidence and understands the duty of speaking the truth.\u000a\u000aSection 230 of the Code prohibits compelling a witness to take oath or make affirmation. The section provides:\u000a\u000aNo witness if he refused to take an oath or make a solemn affirmation shall be compelled to do so or asked his reason for so refusing but the court shall record in such a case the nature of the oath or affirmation proposed, and the fact of the refusal of the witness together with any reason which the witness may voluntarily give his refusal.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, section 231 of the CPC provides \u2018a witness shall take an oath make a solemn affirmation in such a manner as the court considers binding on his conscience.\u2019\u000aWith regard to swearing of Muslims, section 232 provides that:\u000a\u000aNo person of the Moslem faith shall be required to take an oath in any court unless\u000a(a) He has been given an opportunity to complete the ablutions prescribed by the Moslem faith for persons taking oath on the Holy Qu\u2019ran; and\u000a(b) The oath is administered by a person of the Moslem faith; and\u000a(c) The oath is taken upon a copy of the Holy Quran printed in the Arabic language.\u000a\u000aBy virtue of the definition of judicial proceedings under the Penal Code, it is clear that all proceedings in the ordinary courts of law, courts martial and tribunal and, quasi-judicial bodies where the taking of oath is a sine qua non for a witness to testify, are judicial proceedings. Under the Criminal Code, oath is not material, provided the evidence was given before any body authorized to conduct a hearing or an inquiry over a matter. Therefore, statements made before such bodies, if false, can furnish sufficient grounds to prosecute the maker for perjury or for giving false evidence under the Codes. However, a cursory look at section 113 of the Criminal Code, section 180 of the Evidence Act and, section 230 of the CPC reveals a conflict. This is because while the former section permits a witness to testify before a court or tribunal, commission of inquiry or any person on oath or otherwise, section 180 of the Evidence Act makes it mandatory for all oral evidence to be given on oath and, section 230 of the CPC permits a witness to testify if he elects to do so, not on oath or by affirmation. In such a situation, it is important, for the trial judge, the magistrate, the prosecution or defence counsel, to ensure that a statement is extracted from such a witness, which indicates that he agreed to tell the truth in his testimony. If this is not done, the testimony of such a witness may not furnish enough ground to prosecute him/her for perjury or for giving false evidence. Therefore, where a witness who refused to testify on oath or by affirmation, did not undertake to speak the truth, the entire process in such a proceeding may be described as a drama without any intent of it being basis for a criminal prosecution.\u000aThe above notwithstanding the position of the law by virtue of section 1 (2) of the English Perjury Act and, section 9 of the Penal Code, is that while evidence could only he held to have been given in a judicial proceedings, if it was given before a body authorized to receive and examine evidence on oath, such a consideration is immaterial under section 113 of the Criminal Code. In the English case of Shaw where licensing justices held a special preliminary meeting for which there was no statutory authority, they had no power to administer an oath, the proceeding was held not to be judicial one. Equally, where an oath was administered on a witness by a person authorized by law to do so, there can be no perjury, if that person subsequently withdrew. This was decided in Lloyd where a witness was sworn in bankruptcy before a county court registrar, but examined in another room in the absence of the registrar; no perjury was committed in the absence of the registrar who had the competence to receive evidence on oath.\u000aUnder section 117 of the Criminal Code unlike section 156 of the Penal Code and section 1 (1) of the English Perjury Act, the false statement may either be made in an ongoing proceeding or in a case, in which judicial proceeding is either threatened or imminent. Also where a witness in a judicial proceeding, contradicts his earlier statement cannot furnish a ground for the conviction of an accused person. The Nigerian Supreme Court stated so in the case of Joshua v The Queen, where the accused, a Customary Court President, was charged with demanding and with receiving, money to favour a litigant. A witness, who is said to be the go-between when first testifying before a magistrate, denied the corruption; later after a prosecution was begun against him for making a false statement as the police, he testified against the accused. The trial judge treated the witness and the accused as accomplice and, after warning himself of the danger of convicting the accused on such evidence, found their evidence to be true, and convicted the accused. When the trial judge re-examined the witness, in answer to the trial judge, he said there was no difference between his original written statement to the police and his evidence at the trial. The statement was not produced. In allowing the appeal, the Supreme Court held:\u000aThe judge erred in receiving evidence on the contents of the written statement he should have disregarded it in toto the evidence of M.S, who had committed perjury, as unreliable, and then asked himself whether there was enough other evidence for finding the appellant guilty; and as it was uncertain whether the judge would have convicted on the litigant\u2019s evidence alone the conviction would be quashed.\u000aThe requirement that the false statement must have occurred under oath, in a judicial proceeding, which is a sine qua non for the offence of perjury under sections 156 of the Penal Code and 1 (1) of the English Perjury Act 1911, does not have a general application in all cases. For instance, oath may be a first step in the initiation of the proceeding, for example, swearing to an affidavit in support of a motion or any fact contained in a deposition duly sworn. According to Turner, \u2018 In the case of perjury in an affidavit or the like, the offence is committed when the deponent takes oath to the truth of the affidavit, and it is unnecessary to aver or prove that the affidavit was filed or in any way used.\u000aIt is pertinent to emphasis here, that under common law, the only oath required is one 'calling Almighty God to witness that his testimony is true.' Such oath need not be in accordance with the doctrine or tenets of Christianity. It was sufficient if the witness believed in God and, swears in accordance with his religious belief. The purpose of such oaths had the effect of the witness renouncing the mercy and imprecates the vengeance of Heaven if he did not speak the truth. Such oath had the idea of binding the conscience of the witness, and presupposes a religious sanction if the witness told a lie on oath. Such a requirement has been displaced now, in that the solemnity of the occasion when an oath is administered by a witness in a judicial proceeding, no longer implies a religious sanction, but a legal sanction. This can be deduced from section 191 of the Criminal Code:\u000a\u000aAny person who, on any occasion on which a person making a statement touching any matter is required by law to make it on oath, or under some sanction which may by law be substitute for an oath, or is required to verify it by solemn declaration or affirmation makes a statement touching such manner, in any material particular, is to his knowledge false, and verifies it on oath, or under such sanction or by solemn declaration or affirmation; is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.\u000a\u000aThe Evidence Act has also modified the common law rule which required a witness to swear in accordance with his religious belief. Section 182 (1) of the Evidence Act provides:\u000a\u000aAny court may on any occasion if it thinks it just and expedient, receive, the evidence, though not given upon oath, of any person declaring that the taking of any oath whatsoever is, according to his religious belief ought not, in the opinion of the court, to be admitted to give evidence upon oath.\u000a\u000aSection 39 of the Sokoto State Shariah Penal Code include in the definition of an oath, the swearing in the name of Allah or by his attributes and, a solemn affirmation substituted by law for an oath. This means that witnesses in a Shariah Court are given option to affirm instead of swearing in the name of God. It also means that those witnesses in a Shariah Court who may object to swearing on oath in accordance with section 182 (1) of the Evidence Act, are also at liberty to affirm, instead of swearing. However, the common law position on swearing in the name of God, is clearly modified by section 117 of the Criminal Code thus: \u2018The forms and ceremonies used in administering the oath or in otherwise binding the person giving the testimony to speak the truth are immaterial, if the assents to the forms and ceremonies actually used.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Material statement in that proceeding ===\u000aAll the statutes referred to above, require that the statement must be material to the proceeding in question, although the Criminal Code extends the doctrine to cover cases in which proceeding is either threatened or imminent.\u000aThe materiality of the statement need not be intrinsic to the evidence in question. It is sufficient, if it is capable of facilitating the judge's other evidence which had an intrinsic materiality. This has been explained by Turner, thus:\u000a\u2026 so that trivial details, mentioned by a witness in giving his account of a transaction, may become important by their leading the jury to believe that his knowledge of the transaction is complete, and his evidence therefore likely to be accurate on the same ground, all statement made by a witness as to matters that affect his credibility are material, e.g. his denial of having been convicted of crime. And even if the false evidence were legally inadmissible yet this need not prevent its being regarded as \u2018material\u2019 enough to form the subject of an indictment for perjury. There is, for instance, a rule that when a witness answered answers are to be taken as final, so that no other witness can legally be brought to contradict them. Yet if, by a breach of this rule, some second witness be permitted to give this contradiction, and he gave it falsely, he may be indicted for perjury; for, so soon as the contradiction was admitted, it did affect the credit given to the previous witness, and so became \u2018material.\u2019\u000aIt seems that the question is not just failure to tell the truth, that determines the materiality of the statement. Even acts of a witness which obstructed proceeding during cross-examination, may be held to be material. In Millward, where a police officer denied having sought the assistance of his colleague in identifying in the court room a person charged with driving offences, that act was held by the English Court of Appeal as material statement in that it brought to a halt a line of cross-examination, went to the heart of the case, in that the stopping of the cross-examination might very have affected the outcome of the case. However, questions asked during cross-examination, which purpose is to impugn the credibility of a witness as to his previous convictions have been held not to be material. In R v Griepe, accused gave evidence on behalf of the Crown in 1970 on a preliminary objection into a charge of blackmail. The counsel to the alleged blackmailer asked the accused questions as to his credit with regard to his previous convictions between the year 1947 and 1950, which the accused denied but later admitted. The accused was subsequently charged with perjury relating to his evidence at the Magistrate Court in the proceedings for blackmail. The court inter-alia held that the answers given by the accused relating to those convictions not being relevant to those proceedings could not form the basis of a prosecution for perjury.\u000aWhether a statement is material or immaterial seems to be a recondite point. Even as the questions relative to the credibility of a witness, a clear illustration of its operation seems not to be an easy point to determine. Smith argues that questions put to a witness under cross-examination which goes solely to his credit and, he denies it, the general rule is that his answer is final and evidence is not admissible to rebut his denial. Based on this reasoning, the court held in Murray that the accused was not indictable for false statement made when he was permitted to testify in rebuttal of a witness\u2019s denial under cross-examination. In Gibbons the court took a contrary view. In that case, decided by eleven judges (with Martin B. and Cropton J. dissenting), it was held that the accused was guilty, notwithstanding that his statement is inadmissible in law, but logically relevant to the question to be decided, that is the witness\u2019s credibility. The court relied upon Hawkins "\u2026though the evidence signify nothing to the merits of the cause and is immaterial, yet, if it has a direct tendency to material, it is equally criminal in its own nature, and equally tends to abuse the administration of justice, and there does not seem to be any reason why it should not be equally punishable".\u000aIt is submitted that once a person has been lawfully sworn to tell the truth in any judicial proceeding, such a person is under a scared duty to say nothing, but the truth. If he tells a lie on oath, the question as to whether or not such a statement is immaterial to the main issue before the court ought not to arise. This is because the lie was told in a \u2018judicial proceeding,\u2019 where he had sworn to say nothing, but the truth. So whether such deliberate falsehood, will corroborate evidence, as to make it a material statement, for the purpose of prosecuting the maker for perjury, should also not arise. It is in view of this, that Muale, J, in Phillpots, said: \u2018\u2026 it is not material to the judicial proceeding, and it is not necessary that it should have been relevant and material for the issue being tried\u2026\u2019 This proposition differ from the position under Nigerian penal laws and, under the English Perjury Act. Maule, J, proposition in Phillpots is approved by Stephen, who contended that: \u2018it is difficult to imagine a case in which a person would be under any temptation to introduce into his evidence a deliberate lie about a matter absolutely irrelevant to the matter before the court. At common law a person who made a statement which was true, had no defence, it he believed such a statement to be false, or he was just reckless as to the truth or falsity of the statement. This is still the position under section 1 of the English Perjury Act 1911 and, under section 156 of the Penal Code. This position of the law, according to Smith, means that every statement in any judicial proceeding is the actus reus of perjury. This suggests that once such a statement is made, the burden on the prosecution is to prove that the accused made it with mens rea.\u000aBut there are clear situations where the evidence which formed the basis for the assignment of perjury is clearly unconnected to the main issue in dispute. In that case the materiality requirement as a criterion for culpability is then justified. In the case of Omoregie v D.P.P, three assignments were made against the accused (appellant) in a civil case and, the question arose as to whether those assignments were material to main issue in dispute, and whether the appellant made the false statements knowingly. The dispute centered on whether or not the appellant held himself out or was employed as an agent personally responsible for monies on all cement sold out to customers on credit. The first count of the perjury charge was with regard to the money the Plaintiff (a company in Germany) transferred to the appellant in Lagos. The appellant said in his evidence that the alleged money had been transferred before his return to Lagos from Germany. Exhibit \u2018AA\u2019 and \u2018BB\u2019 which were letters written by the appellant corroborated his evidence that he was still awaiting a transfer of the money two weeks after his return to Lagos. In view of the time lapse between the period these letters were written and the period the appellant gave his oral evidence the Supreme Court was of view that the appellant memory might have been playing him false. Apart from the lapse of time which affects memory the court was also of the opinion that even if the evidence on this point was false it may not be a basis for culpability unless it is shown that such evidence was deliberately made with knowledge of its falsehood. And more importantly the court found that even if the evidence was false it was not material to the issue in dispute.\u000aThe second count for the perjury charge was with regard to the evidence of the appellant that he (the appellant) and the respondent agreed not to start business until the formation of a new Company by the appellant. In his evidence the appellant later corrected himself that this was untrue. The court found that the appellant\u2019s difficulties in giving a straightforward evidence about the formation of the new Company was based on the apparent difficulties or untold problems he faced in his business and, the fact that in one occasion cement was shipped to him in his name in Lagos from Germany by the Plaintiff and in another breath cement was shipped to him in the new Company\u2019s name. The court found as a fact that this inconsistency in the shipments of cement accounted to the appellant\u2019s inability to answer the question put to him during cross examination. At any rate the court found that the evidence as to whether or not the parties were not to start business until the new Company was formed was not material to the question whether the appellant held himself out as the agent personally responsible for monies on all cement sold out to customers on credit.\u000aThe third count for the perjury charge was with regard to the conflicting statement of the appellant that he had nothing to do with the first shipments of cement, whereas Exhibit \u2018R\u2019 proved otherwise. Exhibit \u2018R\u2019 is a letter dated 16 October 1956 wherein the appellant was informed of the shipments of the cement. But the court found it puzzling what the appellant meant when he said \u2018having nothing to do with the first shipments of cement.\u2019 The court was therefore of opinion that the appellant should have been questioned on this point in order to clarify exactly what he meant by that statement. This informed the court\u2019s decision that assignment of perjury on the statement that was unclear and, which the appellant was not asked to clarify was wrong. It was in view of the above misconception of the basis for the assignment of perjury that the Supreme Court held discharging the appellant that: On the three matters which the learned Judge complained of and upon which he assigned perjury, it cannot be said that if they are untrue, the appellant knowingly said what he did say knowing them to be untrue, nor can it be said that on the whole evidence that any of them is material to the question at issue in the case before the learned Judge.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Assignment of perjury ====\u000aIn any perjury charge courts are enjoined to specifically set out the assignment of perjury by telling the accused what amount to perjury from his sworn evidence. This is essential and, in particular when a court adopts a summary procedure to commit an accused to prison for perjury. Where the accusation or even the gist of the offence is not clearly discernible from the record a conviction secured in such circumstances is most likely to be set aside on appeal. In the case of Chang Hangkin and Others v Piggot and Another the Privy Council rescinded the committal order against the appellants because the appellants was not given an opportunity to give reasons why the summary measure was being taken against them. This case also decided that it is not essential to set out the assignment of perjury in the summary procedure provided the accused is made aware of the pith of the charge against him.\u000aTherefore once it is shown that an accused was fully aware of the statement he made which formed the basis of the assignment of perjury or false evidence an appeal on this ground will certainly fail. In the Nigerian case of Gesellschaft v Attorney General in re Biney guidelines of what the courts should do in such cases were enunciated as follows: \u2018The proper procedure in such cases is for the Court \u2018to call up the witness and address him to the following effect:\u2019 \u2018It appears to this Court that you have been guilty of perjury in that you have falsely sworn so and so (giving the substance of the allegation of perjury).\u2019 The West African Court of Appeal in the case of R v Otubu stated that failure to follow this procedure does not mean that a conviction will automatically be set aside. That court\u2019s opinion on this as quoted by Sasegbon reads:\u000aThe fact that the witness has been so addressed, and his \u2018answer, if any, should be recorded in the notes of the \u2018presiding Judge.\u2019 We endorse this declaration as to the procedure, which should be followed in such cases. If however there is a failure to follow that procedure it appears from the cases referred to that the conviction will not be quashed provided (a) that the accused was given an opportunity to show cause and (b) that he knew the gist of the accusation made. In the Hong Kong case of Chang Hangkin the conviction was quashed because (b) was not present, whilst in the Gold Coast case In re Nunoo the conviction was upheld because both (a) and (b) were present. In the present case (a) is present but (b) is not and the conviction therefore cannot stand. The appeal is allowed and the order of committal is rescinded and the appellant is discharged.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Oath ===\u000aIn the dim past, taking of oath was dreaded for fear of supernatural sanctions. In that epoch, oath taking was an effective means of discovering the truth. Parties who were unsure of their claims or assertions refrained from taking the oath. That made matters simple and straight forward as it was easy to assume that refusal to take on oath was an admission of the allegation made against the defaulter. In this century, it seems that the efficacy of oath as a means of discovering the truth has been lost to the propensity of witnesses to perjure themselves. How to prevent perjury and, what remedies should be made available for the victims of perjured evidence came under focus in 1970(?) in the Council of Justice Committee. In Part III of the Report, the Justice Committee felt that oath or affirmation is still necessary not only for ensuring high standards of truth but also as a remainder of the solemnity of the occasion, it however, was categorical that oath should be abolished, in that:\u000aMany of those who take a religious oath do so largely as a matter of form (or) because they think they are more likely to be believed if they take the oath, the oath \u2018is only too often regarded as a necessary formality and rattled off with little outward sign of sincerity or understanding of its implications\u2026We therefore think the time has come for the oath in its present form to be abolished and replaced by a form of undertaking which is more meaningful, more generally acceptable and more likely to serve the cause of justice. All witnesses should be required to make same solemn affirmation so that there is no distinction in the respect that is accorded them.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Mens Rea ===\u000aUnder the Criminal Code, mens rea and actus reus as common law concepts are no longer relevant in the interpretation of the provision of the Code. Instead, the expressions \u2018voluntary act\u2019 and \u2018intention\u2019 have replaced them under that Code. This is by virtue of section 24 of the same Code which in defining criminal responsibility did not use these Latin expressions. Therefore, under the Criminal Code where a prohibited act results from the voluntary and intentional act of the perpetrator there is responsibility for the commission of such prohibited act. This means that under the Criminal Code, for a person to be liable for perjury, it must be established that the false statement was made intentionally as against statement made inadvertently or by mistake. This means that the accused must have made the statement which he knows to be false. Under the Penal Code and, the English Perjury Act, an additional element is required, that is, the accused apart from knowing of the falsity of the statement, he does not also believe it to be true. Under the Perjury Act, willfulness is also an essential element. This means that the false statement must have been made deliberately.\u000aUnder both Codes, prove of intention or recklessness, will suffice. In an Indian case of Ratansi Daya, it was held that if the statement is literally true but owing to suppression or certain other facts, a wrong-inference was drawn, the accused cannot be convicted. This means that negligence as to the falsity of the statement will not suffice. According to Hawkins:\u000aIt seemeth that no one ought to be found guilty there of without clear proof, that the false oath alleged against him was taken with some degree of deliberation; for if, upon the whole circumstances of the case it shall appear probable, that it was owing rather to the weakness than perverseness of the party, as where it was occasioned by surprise, or inadvertency, or a mistake of the true state of the question; it cannot be hard to make it amount to voluntary and corrupt perjury\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Corroboration ===\u000aCorroboration which is a time honoured precaution which the common law imposed in prosecutions is not a requirement under the Penal Code.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Conclusion ==\u000aIt is submitted that the offence of perjury arises as a result of a breach of an oath, affirmation or declaration duly sworn in a judicial proceedings, or as observed, by the breach of a witness who declined from being sworn on oath, or being affirmed, of his undertaking to speak the truth. The fact that statutorily, a witness is allowed to testify in a judicial proceeding, if he elects not to be sworn or be affirmed, supports the position under the Criminal Code which extends the application of the law to every falsehood, whether or not made on oath. Under that Code therefore, the solemnity of the occasion is immaterial, as the Code treats telling of lies in the course of judicial proceedings and, outside judicial proceedings, as a criminal offence. The position of the law under that Code suggests that the underlining objective for the proscription of the offence of perjury requires a re-examination. This is because perjury means that a person has proved false to the oath he has taken. It is on this basis that the charge that the person violated the solemnity of his oath is based or assigned, which is termed the assignment of perjury. There may be several assignments which may exist in one oath duly sworn, but it is only one perjury in that proceeding that can be committed.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVHugh Clopton (c. 1440 \u2013 15 September 1496) was a Lord Mayor of London, a member of the Worshipful Company of Mercers and a benefactor of his home town of Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Origins ==\u000aHugh Clopton was born in about 1440 at Clopton House near Stratford-upon-Avon, where the Clopton family had lived since the reign of King Henry III (1216\u20131272). He was a younger son of John Clopton by his wife, a certain Agnes whose surname is unknown. In 1450 his father received license to erect an oratory at the manor house. In 1474 Thomas Clopton, Hugh's elder brother, obtained permission from Pope Sixtus IV to add a chapel to the house for the celebration of divine service.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aAs a younger son excluded from his patrimony by primogeniture, he was expected to make his own fortune and left Clopton for the City of London at an early age, where he was apprenticed in 1457 to the mercer John Roo, and was admitted to the Worshipful Company of Mercers in 1464. He served as Warden of the Company three times, in 1479, 1484 and 1488. On 15 October 1485 he was chosen as Alderman for Dowgate ward. In 1486 he was elected Sheriff of London during Sir Henry Colet's term as mayor, and was himself chosen Lord Mayor of London in 1491. By 1495 he was living in Bread Street. Although some biographers have stated that he was knighted, this does not appear to have been the case as he described himself in his will merely as "citizen, mercer and alderman".\u000aHis vast fortune enabled him to become possessed of his ancestral estates at Clopton, the inheritance of his elder brother, and it is certain that the neighbouring town of Stratford-upon-Avon was his favourite place of residence. In about 1483 he erected there (in Chapel Street) "a pretty house of brick and timber", which was later purchased in 1597 and renovated by the playwright William Shakespeare, and under the name of New Place served as his residence until his death in 1616.\u000aClopton rebuilt the nave of the Chapel of the Stratford Guild of the Holy Trinity, situated opposite his new house in Chapel Street, and he adorned the building with a tower, steeple, glass windows and paintings for the ceiling. He also built the Clopton Bridge, a remarkably fine stone bridge of fourteen arches over the River Avon, having removed at his own expense an old wooden bridge on the site. He also founded the Clopton chantry chapel in the Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon, still notable features of modern Stratford.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Death and burial ==\u000aHe died on 15 September 1497, holding the manor of Clopton as a tenant-in-chief of King Henry VII "as of the manor of the Castle of Beaudesert" by 1/8 of a knight's fee, and left as his heir William Clopton (died 1521), the son of his nephew John, then aged 15. In 1504 William had livery of his great-uncle Hugh's manors of Clopton and Little Wilmcote, and his lands in Stratford and Bridgetown.\u000aBy his will, dated a week before his death, he provided for the completion of the Stratford improvements, and left a hundred marks to twenty-four maidens of the town and £200 for rebuilding the cross aisle of the parish church. He also instituted exhibitions of £4 a year each for five years for three poor scholars at each university of Oxford and Cambridge, and gave £10 to the common box of the Mercers Company, and other sums to the Venturers fellowship resident in Zeland, Brabant, and Flanders, and to "the fellowship of the Staple of Calais".\u000aClopton desired to be buried in the parish church of Stratford, if he died in that town, where he spent much time in his later years. But he died in his London house, in the parish of St Margaret Lothbury, and he finally bequeathed his body to the church of that parish.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Succession ==\u000aClopton never married and left no children. The Clopton estates ultimately passed to Joyce Clopton, of the sixth generation in descent from Thomas Clopton, Sir Hugh's elder brother. She married George Carew, 1st Earl of Totnes, who thus inherited from his wife the manor of Clopton, and was buried in Stratford Church, where survives his magnificent monument containing the effigies of himself and his wife.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aFetherston, John, ed.

He is founder and director of the architecture and design firm, Andreas Vogler Studio.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aAndreas Vogler was raised in Basel, Switzerland. After several semesters of studies in Art History and Literature, Vogler worked as an interior designer with Alinea AG in Basel. In 1988\u20131994 he studied architecture at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule) in Zurich spending one exchange semester at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence (RISD) in the United States and graduated with a diploma project for an energy-independent, pre-fabricated Weather Station on the Weissfluhjoch/Arosa.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aIn 1995 he worked for Ingenhoven Architekten Christoph Ingenhoven in Düsseldorf, and from 1995 to 1996 for Richard Horden Associates, now Horden Cherry Lee Architects in London. Later he became teaching and research assistant at the institute of Professor Richard Horden at the Technical University of Munich until 2002. There he was teaching microarchitecture and initiated and led several design studios for aerospace architecture, focusing on habitability on board the International Space Station, and on studies for future habitats on Mars together with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA. The students involved were able to test their prototypes in parabolic test flights at NASA Johnson Space Center. During the time at the Technical University of Munich Vogler published several papers about space architecture and submitted several prize-winning architectural competitions. In 2003\u20132005 he worked as Guest Professor at The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of Architecture in Copenhagen researching on prefabricated housing. In 2004 he taught at The University of Hong Kong. In 2005- 2006 he was part of the Concept House research group at the Delft University of Technology.\u000aVogler has spoken at numerous international conferences on the topics of aerospace architecture and technology transfer to architecture and sustainability in architecture. He organized international conference sessions and led workshops on a variety of related themes. In 2008 he and Vittori taught an undergraduate course in Industrial Design at the University of Rome La Sapienza and the University Iuav of Venice. He is a member of the Bavarian Chamber of Architects (ByAK- Bayerische Architektenkammer), the Deutscher Werkbund, and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Architecture and Vision ==\u000aIn 2002 Vogler started to collaborate with the Italian architect, Arturo Vittori, with whom he founded in 2003 Architecture and Vision, an international and multidisciplinary studio working in architecture and design, engaged in the development of innovative solutions and technology transfer between diverse fields for aerospace and terrestrial applications. In 2006, a prototype of the extreme environment tent, DesertSeal (2004), became part of the permanent collection of The Museum of Modern Art in New York, after being featured in SAFE: Design Takes on Risk (2005), curated by Paola Antonelli. In the same year, the Museum of Science and Industry Chicago selected Vogler and Vittori as "Modern-day Leonardo's" for its Leonardo da Vinci: Man, Inventor, Genius exhibition. In 2007, a model of the inflatable habitat MoonBaseTwo (2007), developed to allow long-term exploration on the Moon, was acquired for the collection of the Museum of Science and Industry Chicago in Chicago while MarsCruiserOne (2007), the design for a pressurized laboratory rover for human Mars exploration, was shown at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, as part of the exhibition "Airs de Paris" (2007).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Andreas Vogler Studio ==\u000aIn January 2014, Vogler independently formed the Andreas Vogler Studio, an international and multidisciplinary firm working in architecture, transportation, and design located in Munich, Germany. Andreas Vogler Studio with the German Aerospace Center DLR, participated in the GB Railway's "Tomorrow's Train Design Today" transportation competition, and was named a finalist on April 8, 2015.

aVCharlton James Blackwell Monypenny (4 November 1867 \u2013 11 March 1947) was an English-born businessman, and the 27th Laird of the Scottish estate of Pitmilly. As a youth he was a sportsman of some renown who played rugby union for several teams including Cambridge University and the Barbarians. He was president of Cambridge University Athletics Club, for a period was the World Record holder for the 150-yard dash and was one of the fastest men in the world over 100 metres.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal history ==\u000aMonypenny was born in Hampstead, London in 1867 to James Robert Blackwell Monypenny, 26th Laird of Pitmilly and Mary Elizabeth Lane. He was educated at Fettes College before matriculating to Jesus College, Cambridge in October 1889. Monypenny threw himself into sporting life at Cambridge and received three sporting 'Blues' for athletics between 1890 and 1892 in the 100 and 440 yards, taking the 440 yards title and setting a Varsity record in the 1892 meet. While at Cambridge he achieved two running records, the World Record for the 150-yard dash (14.8 secs) and the Cambridge quarter of a mile track record (49.5 secs) which stood until 1931. In 1891 Monypenny was recognised as the seconded fastest man in the world behind American Luther Cary, recording a time of 10.8 seconds in the 100-metre sprint on 22 July. The next year, although recording an identical time of 10.8 seconds, he was judged the joint fastest men in the world that year, along with American athlete Cecil Lee.\u000a\u000aAs well as athletics, Monypenny also joined the Cambridge University rugby team. Although never achieving a 'Blue' for facing Oxford in the Varsity Match, he retained his connection with the sport after leaving university, joining Bath In the 1891\u201392 season Monypenny accepted an invitation to play for newly formed touring team the Barbarians and he also turned out for Scottish exiles team London Scottish. His younger brother, Douglas, also played for London Scottish and was capped three times for the Scotland national rugby union team.\u000aMonypenny married Emila Sybil Wetenhall, daughter of Cecil Algernon Salisbury Wetenhall from Northampton. They had a daughter, Phoebe who became the heiress of Monypenny of Pitmilly.\u000aSometime after leaving Cambridge Monypenny became involved with a brewing firm in Macclesfield, before immigrating to British Guiana in 1902 as a cotton and tobacco grower. While in South America he remarried and had another four children from this second marriage. He remained in British Guiana until 1912 when he moved to Barbados. Monypenny remained in the Caribbean until 1922 when he returned to Britain living in Finchampstead. He remained there until 1930 when he moved to Caversham Heights in Reading; remaining there until his death in 1947.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVDuroville is the nickname for the former Desert Mobile Home Park located in Thermal, California. It is infamous for its poor living conditions, substantial poverty, predatory packs of wild dogs and rampant waste. Duroville garnered a great deal of attention, and which resulted in some aid to its residents. Conditions in Duroville were reported in the Los Angeles Times and New York Times. It is one of several hundred trailer parks, both licit and illicit, catering to the same demographic of migrant farm workers in the region.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Location and condition ==\u000aThe trailer park sits on the Torres Martinez Indian Reservation, and is nicknamed for property owner Harvey Duro, Sr., a member of the tribal council. Duro set the park up after several other sub-standard trailer parks in the area were closed by authorities in Riverside County, and residents had no place to live. Duro was unable to obtain Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) approval for a lease for the site of Duroville, and received no financial or other assistance from the BIA in licensing or setting up the facility. The BIA channeled its efforts into an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, asking that the trailer park be closed.\u000aThe trailer park, established in 1999, was adjacent to a smouldering dump, which is closed and has been subject to recurrent fires. About 4,000 migrant Mexican farm workers live in several hundred dilapidated mobile homes on 40 acres (16 ha). The condition of the park, with its unsafe trailers, dangerous electrical wiring, faulty septic systems and predatory packs of wild dogs, has been the subject of national attention in recent years. An estimated 65% of residents, about 2,000 people, are Purépecha, an indigenous people from the Mexican state of Michoacán, many from the town of Ocumicho.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Litigation ==\u000aLitigation brought by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to have the park closed and its residents relocated was unsuccessful. In a decision rendered on May 1, 2009 U.S. District Judge Stephen G. Larson ruled for benefit of the tenants, claiming that relocating them "would create one of the largest forced migrations in the history of this state." He went on to compare the resulting migration to Japanese-American relocations to Manzanar after the United States' entry into World War II. The court recognized the deficiencies at the park, removed Duro from its management and appointed a receiver. The federal district court retains jurisdiction and continues to review the matter.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Redevelopment ==\u000aThe district court judge, now retired, continues his interest in the community sometimes visiting the community. The court-appointed receiver, speaking in 2010, reported considerable progress in mitigating conditions, for example, 400 dogs were neutered or spayed and 145 adopted. Efforts by the community with outside assistance have greatly improved conditions, however, raw sewage still drains directly from a system of plastic pipes into an open lagoon. Riverside County plans to use federal and state redevelopment funds to facilitate better mobile home facilities nearby, collapsed in 2012 due to loss of funds resulting from the 2008\u201312 California budget crisis. California redevelopment agencies, which sometimes used funds for unnecessary projects but also for badly needed housing, had been shut down. Plans for relocation are further complicated by the illegal status of some of the workers and reluctance by the Purépecha people to break up their community.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aSlideshow "A Delay for Duroville\u2019s Replacement"

aVA kakekotoba (\u639b\u8a5e) or pivot word is a rhetorical device used in the Japanese poetic form waka. This trope uses the phonetic reading of a grouping of kanji (Chinese characters) to suggest several interpretations: first on the literal level (e.g. \u677e, matsu, meaning "pine tree"), then on subsidiary homophonic levels (e.g. \u5f85\u3064, matsu, meaning "to wait"). Thus it is that many waka have pine trees waiting around for something. The presentation of multiple meanings inherent in a single word allows the poet a fuller range of artistic expression with an economical syllable-count. Such brevity is highly valued in Japanese aesthetics, where maximal meaning and reference are sought in a minimal number of syllables. Kakekotoba are generally written in the Japanese phonetic syllabary, hiragana, so that the ambiguous senses of the word are more immediately apparent.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aPivot words are first found in the earliest extant manuscripts where poetic verse is preserved in written form. The earliest examples are from the Nara period. The provenance of the technique is unclear, however it is likely it was already in common use in the period before writing was introduced, as part of the oracular poetic tradition. It is a technique devised to enrich the way of conveying a poem in a limited space. The general pattern is as follows:\u000aUsing the context of the sentence before the kakekotoba and after it to create a new meaning.\u000aThe kakekotoba is translated to two different meanings by itself.\u3000Because it can be translated with different meanings, kakekotoba translations can sometimes be meaningless by themselves, and need a context to bring out their meaning, which was not considered a problem in the Heian period.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Examples ==\u000aKokin Wakash\u016b 571 Love 2\u000aThis poem from the Kokin Wakash\u016b makes a pun that is translated explicitly in the English version. Kara, herecan mean "empty shell" or "corpse" (since the implied narrator's soul has left his body). Spelling this out in translation is the only way to express the pun to an English reader, but doing so destroys the subtlety that makes the original so poignant \u000aKokin Wakash\u016b 639 (From a poetry contest/utaawase)\u000aAlthough the mix-up of tears and rain is a bit trite in Japanese poetry, Toshiyuki creates a new beauty from old fragments through the unusual verb "kokitarete" (drenched) and the kakekotoba on "furisohochi" (meaning both "to fall" and "to soak through"). The kakekotoba is just one way through which poets are able to make unique and beautiful works of art despite working with a rather limited set of acceptable forms, styles, and references \u000aChikuba Kyoginshu 227-228 Miscellaneous\u000aThough from a much later period (15th century), this poem utilizes a multi-layered play on the literary term utamakura ("poem-pillow"). An utamakura is a place-name that is described with set words and associated constantly with the same scenery, season, time of day, etc...; poets often kept notes of their favorite tropes of this sort. Two of the Six Poetic Immortals of the Kokin Wakash\u016b era were the Priest Henjou and Ono no Komachi, who were reputed to be romantically involved despite their competition. The literary term utamakura is here being used for one of its literal constitutive words, "pillow," to imply that Henjou and Komachi were sleeping together. The poem is also referencing similar scenes in the Gosenshu and Yamato Monogatari. Kakekotoba, as this poem shows, are often humorous displays of the writer's wit.\u000aIn English a similar technique is sometimes employed in both poetic and prose language. One contemporary example is: "They say conversation rule the nation, I can tell, but I could never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real." -Kendrick Lamar (Poetic Justice)\u000aThis example only works when the line is heard, not read (because the spelling of the two words are distinct): "right a wrong" and "write a wrong." Conversely, this line would have to be rendered explicitly if it was translated into another language where the two words are not homophones.\u000aAnother contemporary example: "...they like 'go Forres[t], run Forres[t], run Forres[t], go Forres[t]', yeah I mean you already wrote for us... what's one more quote for us?" -Drake (0 to 100)\u000aIn this example, the pivot word is based on the vernacular pronunciation of the words "Forrest" and "for us" where Forrest (alluding to the name Forrest Gump) is pronounced with the final /t/ dropped and the /r/ in both words / phrases elides so that the preceding vowel is elongated, thus "forrest" > foos and "for us" > foos with only slight differentiation in stress, which is basically neutralized in the song. This example is highly complex in that it would require five phrases to be rendered twice each; e.g. "go Forrest" and "go for us" etc., and the final line, which reveals the play on words, "what's one more quote for us?" and "what's one more quote Forrest?"\u000aIt is important to note that both these and the majority of Japanese kakekotoba are highly dependent on vocal recitation, not writing.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notation ==\u000aThe term can also be written as (\u61f8\u8a5e), but the (\u639b\u8a5e) form is more common.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aparonomasia\u000agarden path sentence\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aZhivkova, Stella.

aVJohannes Anton Marquart or possibly Marquardt (born 27 September 1909 in Erolzheim in Germany) was a German actuarial and insurance mathematician. During World War II, Marquart was employed into the Germany Army Inspectorate 7/VI, in 1940, which would later become the General der Nachrichtenaufklärung. He would eventually become head of Referat Ia of Group IV of the organization in November 1944 engaged in research into German Army hand cryptographic systems. Prior to that period Marquart had been chief cryptanalysis in KONA 5.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aMarquart was educated in the Oberrealschule in Erolzheim. He then attended the University of Tübingen, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, University of Vienna and the Goethe University Frankfurt. From Frankfurt University in 1932, he received his degree (German: diplomierter Mathematiker) in mathematics. He was employed as Acturial Mathematician (German: Versicherungsmathematik) until 1940, when he was employed into the Signal Corps of the Wehrmacht and Waffen SS (German: Nachrichtentruppe des Heeres). In 1940 Marquart was posted to OKH/In 7/VI as an employee (German: Angestellter) and for the first year carried out research on German hand ciphers. From 1940 to 1941, Marquart assisted Hans Pietsch, who was director of the mathematical cryptography department at In 7/VI, on hand ciphers, while working as a civilian.\u000aIn 1942, he was drafted to In 7/VI with the rank of Sonderführer, equivalent to the military rank of Major, and was put in charge of a series of courses in elementary cryptanalysis, which work he continued until 1944. He was then promoted to Government technical expert (German: Regierungsbaurat) and was given command over Referat Ia for special research. Marquart's speciality at OKH had been research on the possibility of solution of hand ciphers, and after that with the hand cyphers of foreign countries which were passed to Section Ia from the various (German: Laender) sections of Referat IV.\u000aAfter the war, Marquart worked in the German insurance firm, Allianz Lebensversicherung in Stuttgart, as a field insurance agent for the territory around Mittelbiberach, that at the time was part of the French Zone.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cryptanalytic experience ==\u000aAs head of special research section for hand cyphers, Marquart's work was of a varied nature. Hans Pietsch was his commanding officer.\u000aMarquart worked on the following hand cyphers.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Josip Broz Tito System ===\u000aThis cypher consisted of the alphabet substituted into figures in such a way that the commonest letters were allotted one figure equivalents while the rarer letters were expressed as figure digraphs. The resulting figures were then recyphered (recencrypted) by a periodic additive, the length of which varied from time to time. At first, the period was very short (5,7 or 9); later it rose to 35 or 45 and at the end, Marquart thought that it was used on a one-time basis, since no further successes could be achieved.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 System ===\u000aThis hand cypher was the Double Transposition cipher, using the same key for both cages, the keys being derived from a novel. Marquarts section achieved a fair measure of success with this system, owing to errors in encipherment, stereotyped signatures and also the fact that the cages were often filled up to rectangles with rare letters. Under such circumstances, it was often possible to recover the key from a single message. In some cases, by working out the basic text from which the keys had been derived, they were able to recognize and obtain the novel and hence to read all message traffic currently. All cryptanalytic work on the double transposition systems was carried out entirely by hand by Marquart, and no attempt was made to develop any statistical machine methods for solution.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== British Army Double Transposition ===\u000aThis code used two different keys, which were taken from a large group.

All the counts which they made, however, failed to reveal any non-random characteristics in the design of the tables, and while they thought the Blocknots must have been generated by machine, they were never able to draw any concrete deductions as a result of their research.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Polish Lublin System ===\u000aLastly, Marquart worked on a system used by the military forces of the Lublin Government just before the end of the war.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVBrown's Crossing is a diminutive rural request stop on the northern section of the Manx Electric Railway on the Isle of Man\u000aThe halt caters almost exclusively for local traffic. Due to the nature of the tramway's construction, the cars can stop and drop off almost anywhere and will do so within reason. For this reason a great number of localised stopping places have built up since the line was completed, many at the intersection of farmer's crossings like this one. The crossings/halts usually take the name of the farmer or the farm as is the case here, but these unofficial halts never appear in timetable materials or have nameboards fitted to show their names. Many do however now carry bus stop-type signs attached to traction poles, and these were fitted in line with then-management policy in 1999.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Also ==\u000aManx Electric Railway Stations\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aMike Goodwyn (1993).

aVRobert J. "Bob" Derleth (June 9, 1922 \u2013 December 16, 2012) was an American football lineman. He played college football for the University of Michigan Wolverines football teams in 1942, 1943, 1945 and 1946 \u2014 missing the 1944 season due to military service. He also played professional football for the Detroit Lions in 1947.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aDerleth was born in Marquette, Michigan in 1922. After graduating from Bishop Baraga High School in 1941, Derleth enrolled at the University of Michigan. He joined the Michigan Wolverines football team coached by Fritz Crisler in 1942. He started several games for the Wolverines at the tackle position in 1943. Derleth was also the captain of the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team in 1943.\u000aAfter the 1943 season, Derleth was inducted into the U.S. Navy and assigned to aviation training cadet at the Iowa Pre-Flight School in Iowa City, Iowa. He also played football on the Navy's Iowa Seahawks team. The 1944 Iowa Seahawks included star players such as Les Horvath, and defeated the Iowa Hawkeyes in 1944 by a score of 30 to 6. Derleth also took up track while in the Navy as reflected in a June 1945 wire report: "Bob Derleth and Bobby Mickelson took up track for the first time this season. Proof that Derleth, a former Michigan football tackle, catches on quickly is illustrated by his 133 feet 7-inch cast of the discus which brought him the all-time Seahawk mark in the event."\u000aWhile Derleth was serving in the Navy, the Detroit Lions selected him as a late pick in the 29th round of the 1944 NFL Draft. Upon being placed on inactive status by the Navy in October 1945, Derleth elected to return to the University of Michigan rather than play professional football. The Associated Press reported that Derleth's return to the team had "sparked" the Wolverines. The article continued:\u000a\u000a"Derleth reported for practice yesterday after being placed on inactive dutv by the Navy. The Marquette, Mich., lineman immediately was issued a uniform and put in considerable time at the right guard spot during scrimmage. The former aviation cadet said he was in 'pretty good' physical shape and was an inch taller and about 14 pounds heavier than the last time he played for Michigan. In 1942 he was six-two and weighed 203."\u000a\u000aIn mid-October 1945, Derleth returned to Michigan after being placed on inactive duty by the Navy. He saw action in the November 1945 "Homecoming" game against Minnesota. During the 1946 season, Derleth returned to the starting lineup at the tackle position. Derleth suffered a concussion in the 1946 game against Illinois and did not play the following week.\u000aAfter his 1946 season at Michigan, Derleth was drafted in by the Chicago Rockets in the 1947 AAFC draft as the 25th overall pick. In May 1947, Derleth signed instead with the Detroit Lions, who still held the NFL rights to his services. At the time Derleth signed with the Lions, he weighed 230 pounds. The 1947 Detroit Lions team included six former Michigan football players, including Derleth's Wolverine teammates Bob Westfall, Merv Pregulman, Bob Wiese, and Elmer Madar. Derleth appeared in only one game for the Lions in 1947. He was later recognized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame on the honor roll of more than 1,000 NFL personnel to serve in the military during World War II.\u000aDerleth later became the president of Motor Wheel Corporation, a position he held from 1967 to 1979. He died in December 2012 at a hospice in Lansing, Michigan, at age 90.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Haliburton Forest & Wild Life Reserve Ltd. (Haliburton Forest) is a privately owned forest, comprising 300 square kilometres (120 sq mi) in Haliburton County, Ontario, Canada. It is about 270 kilometres (170 mi) northeast of Toronto, and just south of and abutting Algonquin Provincial Park.\u000a\u000aHaliburton Forest is a "multi-use forest", with attractions such as the Haliburton Forest Wolf Centre, a canopy walk as well as the world's only freshwater tour submarine. Haliburton Forest operates recreation, tourism and education programs year-round. Its forestry operations were the first to be certified by the international Forest Stewardship Council in Canada. Haliburton Forest supports ecosystem based research projects, primarily conducted by the University of Toronto's Faculty of Forestry.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe northern townships of Peterborough County in the British North-American Province of Upper Canada were first surveyed during the winters of 1862/63. In 1885, 10 of these townships (basically the present municipality of Dysart et al, Ontario) were sold to the London-based Canadian Land and Emigration Company under the leadership of Thomas Chandler Haliburton.\u000aThe company planned on subdividing its holdings into 100-acre (0.40 km2) lots and selling them to British emigrants as farmland. Those plans crumbled as soon as it became obvious that the lands in question, with the exception of small parcels, were unsuitable for agriculture. The company went into receivership and was renamed the "Canadian Land and Immigration Company", with headquarters in Toronto.\u000aFrom 1870 to 1910, large lumber companies acquired cutting rights and cleared most of the white pine stands.\u000aBy the 1930s, up to 80,000 acres (320 km2) remained in the hands of the Algonquin Corporation who continued harvesting timber until they were acquired by Hay and Co., a veneer milling company based in Woodstock, Ontario, in 1946. Between 1946 and 1971, more than 150,000,000 board feet (350,000 m3) of lumber had been sawn and several million more board feet of veneer left northern Haliburton for the mother mill in Woodstock. Most of this timber was cut on the land that today makes up Haliburton Forest.\u000aBy 1960, two forest inventories suggested that the harvestable volume of timber was rapidly declining on Hay and Co. lands, which had been taken over in the meantime by Weldwood of Canada. The decline through harvesting methods and volumes during the past was deemed detrimental to future production and the land was put up for sale.\u000aIn 1962, German Baron von Fuerstenberg acquired the Weldwood property and renamed his holding Haliburton Forest and Wild Life Reserve Ltd. Previously, the lakeshores of Redstone and Kennisis Lakes had been sold off to a development company. The timber rights remained with the Weldwood mill until 1967 before being turned over to the new company. A few years later, in 1970, the sawmill at Kennisis Lake closed down.\u000aThe traditional activities on which Haliburton Forest has always depended and which have prevented development from destroying the wilderness are still underway. Logging is conducted on an extensive scale and in a way that improves the quality of the forest, a major reversal of past practices. Rather than taking the best wood, the company's foresters take out the low quality and mature trees. The result is a high quality, healthy forest for the future.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Fishing ==\u000aSeveral of the lakes within the park are home to native brook trout and lake trout. Four lakes (Stocking Lake, Dutton, No Name Lake, Wildcat Lake) are known to be naturally reproducing Brook Trout lakes \u2013 a rarity.\u000aThere are also several bass fisheries within the forest. Among them Kelly and Johnson Lake are easily accessible, while Gadwall and especially Powderhorn pose a challenge to access.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Wolf Centre ==\u000a\u000aThe Wolf Centre opened in July 1996 to the general public and is home to a pack of five timber wolves (Canis lupus). Within the 61,000-square-metre (656,600 sq ft) enclosure (one of the largest in the world), they roam freely Fed on a random schedule (approximately once a week), they can often be found hanging out near the viewing area. As this is close to both the highest point in the enclosure and the water source, they are often nearby.\u000aThree months prior to the opening, Patricia Wyman, a new employee at the facility, lost her life due to five wolves attacking her. After this incident, her body was found wearing nothing and it featured multiple mauling wounds.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Conservation and forestry ==\u000aThe privately owned Haliburton Forest claims to strike a balance between short-term requirements of a successful, operational business and long-term needs of sustainable resource use and conservation. Over the past four decades, its 70,000 acres (280 km2) have been transformed from a depleted forestry holding to a multi-use operation which contributes economically and environmentally to the surrounding rural community.\u000aHaliburton Forest was the first forest in Canada certified as a "sustainable forest" under the stringent guidelines of the international Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The certifying agency at that time was Boston, MA based Smartwood/Rainforest Alliance.\u000a\u000a\u000a== EcoLog Homes ==\u000a\u000aEcoLog Homes is a builder and supplier of log home kits. The logs they harvest come from the 70,000 acres (280 km2) privately owned Haliburton Forest & Wildlife Reserve Ltd. Mature hemlock come due for harvesting every season, some measuring up to thirty inches in diameter. Each tree is felled and skidded by horse before being transported to the nearby Haliburton Forest Mill. Each board is squared for timbers or sawn into boards for planking.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Canopy Tour -- A Walk in the Clouds ==\u000a\u000aThis experience includes: a guided van tour through the private lands of Haliburton Forest and Wildlife Reserve Ltd., passing through forests and along lakes and streams; a 0.5 km walk along the scenic Pelaw River; a short, guided voyageur-canoe ride across a wilderness lake to the final destination\u2014Canopy Boardwalk.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Snowmobiling ==\u000a\u000aWith 80,000 acres (320 km2) of forest wilderness, 50 lakes, and numerous ponds and creeks, Haliburton Forest is the only wholly privately owned snowmobiling operation in the world. The core of the 300-kilometre (190 mi) trail system is double tracked and up to 20 feet (6 m) wide. Scenic single tracked trails access some of the remote areas within the property. Half a dozen shelter cabins equipped with stoves and firewood line the trail system.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Dogsledding ==\u000a\u000aIntroductory, half and full-day dogsledding tours are available at Haliburton Forest along groomed winter trails with over 130 Siberian Huskies. Professional guides provide introduction to the basics of dogsledding.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Mountain biking ==\u000aBikers have a choice of access roads, forest trails, or a route that covers some of the toughest terrain in the Province. The cycling season runs from Victoria Day to the weekend after Thanksgiving.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Astronomy ==\u000aDue to its location three hours north of the lights of the Golden Horseshoe, Haliburton Forest is part of the Algonquin Dome, offering light-free viewing of the skies. This location allows astronomers to observe stars, galaxies and deep sky objects not normally observed in light polluted locations.\u000a\u000a\u000a== The observatory ==\u000aSituated on a small rise near the entrance point into the forest, the observatory offers an unobstructed view of the night skies. Once the roof rolls off, it reveals its identity as a home for telescopes and other astronomy equipment. The ground floor is set up for presentations.\u000aThere are two 10\u2033 and one 12\u2033 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes. They are self-tracking and equipped with computerised functions accessing a 64,000 object database.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sawmill tours ==\u000a\u000aThe new Haliburton Forest sawmill opened to the public in 2010.

His signature, \u03cc \u039b\u03c5\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2, ho Lydos, the Lydian, inscribed on two vases, is informative regarding the cultural background of the artist. Either he immigrated to Athens from the Lydian empire of King Kroisos, or he was born in Athens as the son of Lydian parents. In any case, he learned his trade in Athens.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Style ==\u000aIt is difficult to definitely recognise his work, since he was the centre and main artist of a highly productive Attic pottery workshop. For that reason, many vases are simply described as in the style of Lydos. Several other individual artists within his circle can be identified, including the Painter of Vatican 309 and Painter of Louvre F 6. These works are quite homogeneous in style, but differ considerably in terms of quality.\u000aThe style of Lydos strongly resembles that of older artists, such as the painters of Siana cups, of which he himself painted many. He was the last Attic painter to decorate large vases entirely with polychrome animal friezes in the Corinthian style. His human figures resemble the works of Klitias, and later painters, whose humans appear \u201cwrapped\u201d in cloth. Sometimes they have dotted garments, such as preferred by the Amasis Painter. His figures exude a dignity nearly akin to those by Exekias. The Lydos Group did not only paint large vases, but also known for miniature work. For example, they painted little-master cups and eye-cups. Ascribed to Lydos himself is a band cup potted by Nikosthenes.\u000aHis early works show a tendency to use colour, which decreased throughout his career. Similarly, at an early stage he paid much attention to certain details, such as the hairy backs of cat-like animals, whereas later he concentrated more on gesture. His animal figures appear somewhat stiff, but are usually highly decorative. Lydos painted vases by a variety of potters, including Nikosthenes, Kolchos, Epitimos and Amasis.\u000aHis workshop\u2019s style can be described as out-of-date but was used well into the 520s BC. It is not clear why that is the case; perhaps the material was aimed at older or poorer customers. The last artist to resemble Lydos in style was the Ready Painter.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Themes ==\u000aLydos frequently painted mythological scenes and newly introduced several specific motifs of that genre to Attic vase painting. The quality of his paintings varies. He often painted so-called \u201cpenguin women\u201d, wearing a cloak held together by the chest, probably by a kind of sash, and terminating in a tail-like feature at the back. His men often ere a himation, painted in diagonal stripes, so that they appear as if bandaged. An oinochoe, the vessel itself made by the potter Kolchos (Berlin, Antikensammlung F 1732) depicts mannerist figures. Athena (supporting Herakles, who is fighting Kyknos) is rendered as a silhouette figure in the style of the Amasis Painter, while the figures of Ares and Zeus (who joins the fighting) represent an attempt to utilise the new three-dimensional drawing style, developed around 540 BC. Lydos\u2019s palmettes, placed on neck and handles of the vessel are stylistically transitional: they can be seen as a late form of the earlier black-figure style, but also as the beginning of the decorative styles that were to flourish in red-figure vase painting. His best works also include several plates decorated with flying or running figures. One of his plates is decorated with a gorgoneion covering the entire surface.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Works ==\u000aWorks ascribed to Lydos can be found on all types of vase shape then produced in the Athenian potters\u2019 quarter, including a series of grave pinakes.\u000aOne of his two signed vases is a dinos, preserved only in fragments and found on the Athenian Acropolis. In style it resembles the works of the Painter of Acropolis 606 and Nearchos. The main frieze depicts a very carefully designed Gigantomachy. Subsidiary friezes show a procession a hunt and various animals. Especially striking aspects of the work are a number of details and the colouring. Lydos painted a wasp as a shield emblazonment and dangerous-looking knives in the procession scene. These martial aspects are balanced by the high-quality animal friezes.\u000aAnother well-known work by him is a column krater, now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York City. It is nearly as large as the François Vase, but is decorated only with a single frieze, so that the figures reach a height of nearly 25 cm. The painter focused not so much on the depicted narrative (return of Hephaistos), but on the gestures of the figures Dionysos and Hephaistos, and even more so of the accompanying satyrs and maenads. He omitted circumstantial detail, as used e.g. by Klitias, and failed to present the satyrs genitals as the Amasis Painter would have. Instead, his satyrs are depicted as \u201cgentlemen\u201d.\u000aSome particular works are as follows.\u000aMalibu, J.

aVPublished in 1983, In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose is a collection composed of 36 separate pieces written by Alice Walker. The essays, articles, reviews, statements, and speeches were written between 1966 and 1982. Many are based on her understanding of "womanist" theory. Walker defines "womanist" at the beginning of the collection as "A black feminist or feminist of color. From the black folk expression of mother to female children and also a woman who loves other women, sexually and/or nonsexually. Appreciates and prefers women's culture. Committed to survival and wholeness of entire people, male and female".\u000aIn addition to writing about womanhood and creativity, Walker addresses subjects such as nuclear weapons, anti-Semitism, and the Civil Rights Movement. In a 1984 review of the collection, Lynn Munro noted that: "Reading these essays not only gives one a clearer sense of Alice Walker but also countless insights into the men and women who have touched her life." As Munro put it, Walker "captures the voices of unsung heroines" with whom she has crossed paths.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Part 1 ==\u000aEssays in In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens Part I:\u000a"Saving the Life That Is Your Own: The Importance of Models in the Artist's Life"\u000a"The Black Writer and the Southern Experience"\u000a"But Yet and Still the Cotton Gin Kept on Working\u2026"\u000a"A Talk: Convocation 1972"\u000a"Beyond the Peacock: The Reconstruction of Flannery O'Connor"\u000a"The Divided Life of Jean Toomer"\u000a"A Writer Because of, Not in Spite of, Her Children"\u000a"Gifts of Power: The Writings of Rebecca Jackson"\u000a"Zora Neale Hurston: A Cautionary Tale and a Partisan View"\u000a"Looking for Zora"\u000a"Bash the Whites"\u000aWithin these essays, She speaks about her search for early black writers such as Rebecca Jackson. She speaks of unsung heroines whom she has come into contact with who wish to tell their stories; for example Mrs. Winson Hudson. Hudson, the director of a Headstart center, wished to tell her story so that people would know "the agitation she caused in her community\u2026was not for herself or for any one group but for everybody in the county". However, of all the writers she introduces, Zora Neale Hurston becomes a focal part in this section of essays.\u000aAs Walker begins to research the practice of voodoo by rural Southern blacks in the thirties, she becomes aware of Hurston's works. Other than white anthropologists with racist views, Walker finds no one other than Hurston studied voodoo extensively. Hurston's book Mules and Men, a collection of folklore, sparks Walker's interest immediately because it provides all the stories that Southern blacks "had forgotten or of which they had grown ashamed\u2026and showed how marvelous, and, indeed, priceless, they are". In her essay, "Looking for Zora," Walker speaks about her trip to Hurston's hometown of Eatonville, FL to discover the life of her ancestral teacher. Despite Hurston's notoriety, when she passed in 1959, she was buried in an "unmarked grave in a segregated cemetery". When Walker arrives in Florida, she purchases a tombstone that reads: "Zora Neale Hurston 'A Genius of the South' Novelist, Folklorist, Anthropologist 1901-1960". The line "a genius of the South" comes from a poem by Jean Toomer, whom Walker applauds for his "sensitivity to women and his ultimate condescension toward them". Walker's exploration for the black writers of the past connects to her search for the kind of books that are underrepresented in American literature. She confirms this based on her referral to a comment by Toni Morrison: When Toni Morrison said she writes the kind of books she wants to read, she was acknowledging the fact that in a society in which 'accepted literature' is so often sexist and racist and otherwise irrelevant or offensive to so many lives, she must do the work of two. She said she must be her own model as well as the artist attending, creating, learning from, realizing the model, which is to say, herself. Walker's search for 'models' is an attempt to "capture the voices" of writers who are often overlooked and/or forgotten such as Zora Neal Hurston.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Part II ==\u000aIn Part II of In Search of Our Mother's Gardens Alice Walker focuses on the Civil Rights Movement and the important leaders who made contributions to it. Through these essays, she also exemplifies how important the Civil Rights Movements' aims were for African Americans. Part Two includes the following essays:\u000a"The Civil Rights Movement: What Good Was it?"\u000a"The Unglamorous but Worthwhile Duties of the Black Revolutionary Artist, or of the Black Writer Who Simply Works and Writes"\u000a"My Father's Country is Poor"\u000a"Making the Moves and the Movies We Want"\u000a"Good Morning, Revolution:Uncollected Writings of Social Protest"\u000a"Choice: A tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr."\u000a"Coretta King: Revisted"\u000a"Choosing to Stay at Home: Ten Years after the March on Washington"\u000a"Lulls"\u000a"Recording the Season"\u000a"The Almost Year"\u000aIn many of these essays Walker describes her involvement in the Civil Rights Movement and explores the positives and negatives of the Civil Rights Movement's purpose. At the time of Civil Rights, Walker comprehends that she needs to make a change. She commences to take action by visiting several homes and handing out registration ballots so the privileged and underprivileged could vote. She met a Jewish law student named Mel Leventhal, who gave her inspiration to write "The Civil Rights Movement: What Good Was it?." Many people believed that Civil Rights Movement was dead. Alice Walker points out that if it is dead, she will explain why she believes that it is not. For many African Americans, the Civil Rights Movement gave them a sense of hope and freedom. She shows that whites would see the Civil Rights Movement as being dead because they did not have to go through the struggles and sacrifices that African-Americans had to encounter. They did not have to show interest because this movement was intended to help African-Americans to be equal and get the same rights as white people. White people already had the rights that the law granted and African Americans were still fighting for it. Besides that she points out that other ethnicities were unable to understand the significance behind the Civil Rights Movement and its importance for African Americans.\u000aOf the Civil Rights Movement, Walker says, "It gave us history and men far greater than presidents. It gave us heroes. Selfless men of courage and strength, for our little boys and girls to follow. It gave us hope for tomorrow. It called us to life. Because we live, it can never die". "Choice: A Tribute to Dr. Luther King Jr." emphasizes how much passion and respect Walker has for Dr. King. In this particular essay, she speaks from a restaurant that refused to serve African Americans in 1972. Walker is able to learn from Dr. King's experience because as an African American, she had to endure those same struggles. Walker's mother taught her and her siblings to embrace their culture but at the same time to move up north to escape the harsh realities of the South. Walker and her mother were present for Dr. King's infamous speech. Ultimately, this changes Walker's perspective on racism and the effects of the Civil Rights Movement within the African-American community. Dr. King's example greatly inspires Walker's viewpoint of how she sees the South.\u000aThe backlash of racial tension between blacks and whites were extreme. Dr. King was seen as a savior for the African-American community. Walker recalls, "He gave us continuity of place, without which community is ephemeral. He gave us home". Due to her great admiration for Dr. King, she returns to the South to empower African-American communities.\u000aIn "The Almost Year", Alice Walker explains how the author Florence Randall explains how she wants blacks and whites to embrace one another. She clarifies that "she seeks to find a way in which black abused and poor and white privileged and rich can meet and exchange some warmth of themselves. Walker's perspective is that if both blacks and whites can stop the racial equality that blacks and whites will not be divided. In this house, a black girl feels somewhat threatened being an all-white household. Due to these circumstances, Walker provides a sense of division between the black girl and the family that is providing a home for her to feel free. The black girl cannot embrace the warmth from the Mallory's family because she feels that all white people are to hurt black people. Walker explains how the Civil Rights Movement intended to bring both blacks and whites together. Walker wants to show how a black girl should not have to feel unequal when they are around white people.\u000aMoreover, in "Coretta King: Revisited," Alice Walker describes an interview with Coretta Scott King. Walker presents her as more than a mother and wife; she is similar to her husband, and is making a conscientious effort to fight for equality and civil liberties for African Americans. Walker sees strength in Coretta Scott King, a woman who just lost her husband due to the acts of violence from others. Walker finds it difficult to understand how a woman who just lost a loved one to the brutality, could continue in the battle for Civil Rights. Walker praises the fact that Coretta Scott King did not just sit back but took actions to help with different campaigns. Walker converses with her on about "black people in power and the whites who work with them" and Ms. King says, "I don't believe that black people are going to misuse power in the way it has been misused. I think they've learned from their experiences. And we've seen instances where black and white work together effectively".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Part III ==\u000aPart Three of In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens includes the following essays:\u000a"In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens"\u000a"From an Interview"\u000a"A Letter to the Editor of Ms."\u000a"Breaking Chains and Encouraging Life"\u000a"If the Present Looks Like the Past, What Does the Future Look Like?"\u000a"Looking to the Side, and Back"\u000a"To The Black Scholar"\u000a"Brothers and Sisters"\u000aPart three addresses black women coping with self-worth and self-respect. It offers encouragement to future generations of Black men and women. Walker begins part III with a poem by Marilou Awiakta, "Motheroot." In this section of the collection Walker is on a mental journey seeking ways to uplift the Black race. Along this exploration she uses literature of other Black poets and writers to gain a deeper insight on Black women in their era, which assisted Walker in understanding society in her era.\u000aIn the opening of "In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens", Walker quotes from Jean Toomer's Cane, taking note that in early literature by black men, black women were seen has hopeless and characterized as mere sex objects. "I asked her to hope, and build up an inner life against the coming of that day\u2026I sang, with a strange quiver in my voice, a promise song." Walker says black women did not have the opportunity to pursue their dreams because they were given the main responsibility of raising children, obeying their husbands, and maintaining the household: "Or was she required to bake biscuits for a lazy backwater tramp, when she cried out in her soul to paint watercolors of sunsets, or the rain falling on the green and peaceful pasturelands? Or was her body broken and forced to bear children." Walker personalizes these women by referring to them as "our mothers and grandmothers". Toomer felt that black women were unhappy and felt unloved. Both Walker and Toomer felt that black women were not allowed to dream, yet alone pursue them. "They were Creators, who lived lives of spiritual waste, because they were so rich in spirituality, which is the basis of art, that the strain of enduring their unused and unwanted talent drove them insane". Walker proceeds in saying how oppression has caused many talented black women to go unnoticed or unheard of. Walker cites Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Roberta Flack, and Aretha Franklin to note talent lost among the black race and culture.\u000aAdditionally, Walker refers to Virginia Woolf's, A Room of One's Own and writer Phillis Wheatley; Walker compares both artists conveying that all of Woolf's fears were Wheatley's reality; due to restraints all of Woolf's goals were unachievable for Wheatley. Woolf writes, "any woman born with a great gift in the sixteenth century would certainly have gone crazed, shot herself, or ended her days in some lonely cottage outside the village, half witch, half wizard, feared and mocked at. For it needs little skill and psychology to be sure that a highly gifted girl who had tried to use her gift for poetry would have been so thwarted and hindered by contrary instincts, that she must have lost her health and sanity to a certainty." Wheatley experienced everything Woolf dreaded, although Wheatley was granted limited freedom of expression and education by her owners. Walker focuses on the phrase, "contrary instincts" used by Woolf, believing that this what Wheatley felt since she was taught that her origin was an untamed and inadequate culture and race. In Wheatley's poetry she describes a "goddess", which Walker perceives as her owner, whom Wheatley appreciates although she was enslaved by this person. Walker pays tribute to Wheatley when she writes, "But at last Phillis, we understand. No more snickering when your stiff, struggling, ambivalent lines are forced on us. We know now that you were not an idiot or a traitor".\u000aAccording to Walker, society viewed Black women as, "the mule of the world", this caused black women to become emotionless and hopeless. Further, in the essay Walker gives a personal account of her own mother, "And yet, it is to my mother-and all our mothers who were not famous-that I went in search of the secret if what has fed that muzzled and often mutilated, but vibrant, creative spirit that the black woman has inherited, and that pops out in wild and unlikely places to this day". Walker describes her mother's simple, but appreciated talent of gardening. For Walker, her mother's ability to continue gardening despite her poor living conditions portrays her mother's strong persona and ability to strive even in hardship. "She spent the summers canning vegetables and fruits. She spent the winter evenings making quilts enough to cover all our beds. There was a never a moment for her to sit down, undisturbed, to unravel her own private thoughts; never a time free from interruption-by work or the noisy inquiries of children. The theme and idea of legacy reoccurs towards the end of the essay. Walker describes, the legacy of her mother, "Her face, as she prepares the Art that is her gift is a legacy of respect she leaves to me, for all that illuminates and cherishes life". Walker reveals how she has found and understood herself, while researching her heritage.\u000a"From An Interview" gives readers a deeper insight on Walker's personal struggle with self-worth. Walker extensively reveals her inner conflicts and the imperative events in her life that has made her the person she is. Walker refers to herself as a "solitary" person from as early as her childhood. Walker was discloses that she was teased as a child due to her disfigurement, which made her feel worthless and later on as a college student she began to seriously contemplate suicide. Walker says, "That year I made myself acquainted with every philosopher's position on suicide, because by that time it did not seem frightening or even odd, but only inevitable". Walker also began to lose her faith in a higher being because she felt as though her thoughts of suicide disappointed God, therefore weakening her relationship with him. Walker explains that with the help of friends and poetry she unraveled herself from this path of self-destruction. According to Walker her main release of energy is through poetry. Walker then explains her passion for poetry, "Since that time, it seems to me that all of my poems-and I write groups of poems rather than singles-are written when I have successfully pulled myself out of a completely numbing despair, and stand again in the sunlight. Writing poems is my way of celebrating with the world that I have not committed suicide the night before". Walker expresses that with her experiences she has developed a passion to help Black women who lack the self-esteem as she once did.\u000a"If the Present Looks Like the Past, What Does the Future Look Like?" addresses the divide within the black community. In the opening of the essay Walker bluntly begins with the division among lighter and darker skinned black women. Walker speaks about how lighter women unintentionally and unknowingly offend dark skinned women when she says, "What black women would be interested in, I think, is a consciously heightened awareness on the part of light black women that they are capable, often quite unconsciously, of inflicting pain upon them; and that unless the question of Colorism\u2013 in my definition, prejudicial or preferential treatment of same-race people based solely on their color\u2013 is addressed in our communities and definitely in our black "sisterhoods" we cannot, as a people, progress. For colorism, like colonialism, sexism, and racism, impedes us". Walker encourages the two groups to be sensitive towards one another, or else progression of Black people will be haunted. Walker urges Black people to pave the way for future generations to eliminate the distress experienced by her and many others. Walker expresses this thought when she says, "\u2026I believe in listening-to a person, the sea, the wind, the trees, but especially to young black women whose rocky road I am still traveling".\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aAlice Walker\u000aWomanism\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sources ==\u000aMunro, C.

aVMier (Spanish   ), also known as El Paso del Cántaro, is a city in Mier Municipality in Tamaulipas, located in northern Mexico near the Rio Grande, just south of Falcon Dam. It is 90 miles (140 km) northeast of Monterrey on Mexican Federal Highway 2. (26°28'N 99°10'W)\u000aIn 1990, the population was recorded at 6,190. By the 2010 census, it had dropped to 4,762 inhabitants. It has an agricultural economy centered on cotton, sugar cane, corn, and livestock.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe town was founded on March 6, 1753. The land was originally owned by Felix de Almandoz. Land later passed on to General Prudencio Basterra who married Felix's sister Ana Maria. 19 Families from Camargo formed the new settlement.\u000aThe town is called Mier because the governor of Nuevo León from 1710 to 1714, Francisco Mier y Torre, used to spend the night there on his way to Texas. It began to be called Estancia de Mier and then simply Mier. This is where the steamboats used to stop when they came up the Río Bravo.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Conflicts with the Republic of Texas ===\u000a\u000aOn his return to power, General Santa Anna sent a force of seven hundred men, mostly mounted Mexican troops under the command of General Ráfael Vásquez, to occupy San Antonio in early March 1842.\u000aThe \u201cwar hawks\u201d in the Texas Congress forced President Sam Houston to act. The President ordered General Alexander Somervell to command the assembling volunteers at San Antonio. Men of all kinds came pouring into town, some shoeless, most horseless, some seeking adventure, and others of the criminal sort, wishing only to sack Mexican towns and villages. As Houston had hoped, Somervell acted indecisively. Soon, considerable looting of Tejano stores in San Antonio, coupled with out-and-out insubordination, broke up the volunteers before they could march on Mexico and start a major war.\u000aRelations between Texas and Mexico worsened, especially after the Mexican general Adrián Woll and fourteen hundred troops again captured San Antonio in September. Houston once again summoned Somervell to organize and lead the volunteers but hoped that the Texas general would remain north of the Nueces River. But as the army grew to 750 men, even Somervell realized that he would have to act. His volunteers had taken on an identity of their own; had he refused to march, the troops would have left him.\u000aThe army was slowly breaking up as a result of the disorder and looting, after Laredo was captured. The 500 who remained followed Somervell south to Guerrero, where pillaging occurred. Here a mutiny erupted in which 189 men followed William S. Fisher, Ewen Cameron, and Thomas Green into the Mexican town of Mier.\u000aOn December 23, 1842, Fisher and most of the men crossed the Rio Grande and entered the Ciudad Mier, where they met no resistance. They demanded supplies from the town, which the town's alcalde promised to deliver. The troops withdrew and waited. In the meantime, a large detachment of Mexican troops arrived in the town. On December 25, the two sides engaged in a bloody battle that lasted almost 24 hours. The Texans sustained thirty casualties and ran out of food, water, and ammunition. More than 200 Texans surrendered to Mexican forces, unaware that they had mauled the Mexican troops to an almost unbelievable degree, inflicting an astounding 800 casualties.\u000aAs far as the Mexicans were concerned, the Texans were privateers on an unauthorized raid and entitled to no consideration as military prisoners of war. They were sentenced to death and then taken on a forced march to Mexico City. Fisher was separated from the group, but the men selected a leader from among themselves, a Scottish-born captain named Ewen Cameron. Along the way, Cameron led most of the prisoners in an escape attempt. The Texans tried to make a run back for the border, but they hadn't bargained on the harsh and dry conditions in the mountains. All but three were recaptured and returned to the town of Salado, Tamaulipas.\u000aWhen he heard about the break-out, Antonio López de Santa Anna ordered that the recaptured prisoners, some 176 men, be put to death immediately. The Governor of Coahuila, Francisco Mexía, refused to carry out the order and pleaded with foreign ministers in Mexico City to persuade the president to change his mind. (Santa Anna was out of office from 26 October 1842 to 4 March 1843, with Nicolás Bravo serving in the Presidential capacity.)\u000aWhat happened next became known as the "Black Bean Episode." Santa Anna promised the foreign ministers that he would show mercy, and then modified his decree to order the decimation of the Mier prisoners; in other words, the execution of every tenth man. At El Rancho Salado, which was presumably in the state of Coahuila, on March 25, 1843 \u2013 three months after the Battle of Mier \u2013 the prisoners were forced to draw a bean from a jar (while blindfolded) containing 159 white beans and 17 black beans. At dusk that day, those unlucky enough to draw a black bean were shot to death, in two groups.\u000aCameron had drawn a white bean, which should have saved his life. However, he had earned the hostility of Mexican Colonel Antonio Canales Rosillo, for his role in the embarrassing defeat in his battle (July 1842 at Fort Lipantitlán, near Corpus Christi, Texas), and for leading the escape attempt. Canales intervened with Santa Anna, and he agreed. Cameron was shot by a firing squad at Perote Prison on April 26, 1843.\u000aThe remaining prisoners were put to work on a road gang. In September 1843, most of them were confined at the notorious Perote Prison in the state of Veracruz, while a few were separated from the group and scattered into other prisons around Mexico. Over the next few months, some managed to escape, while others died of wounds, disease, and starvation. Diplomats from the United States and Great Britain worked for the release of the Mier prisoners. They were eventually paroled in piecemeal fashion, with the last prisoner going home in September 1844.\u000aIn 1847, during the Mexican-American War, the remains of the men executed in the Black Bean Episode were retrieved from Mexico and interred near La Grange, Texas, (with those who died in the Dawson Massacre), at which site has been established a monument.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Fidel Castro in Mier ===\u000aOne historic event from Mier occurred in 1956 involving Fidel Castro. At that time Ciudad Mier had near 4,000 inhabitants. Its isolation and close proximity with the U.S. border led to it becoming a mecca for smugglers.\u000aFidel Castro had learned of the fashion in which any merchandise could be crossed illegally by the Rio Grande into Mier. At that time Castro was preparing for a revolution in Cuba and was meeting with leaders in Mexico City. Castro needed weapons and went to Mier to obtain them. Mier town historian Antonio Guerra said only the best smugglers received the assignment.\u000aThe operation was assigned to Juan 'El Chapiado' González, from Mier, and Santiago 'El Chago' Guerra, from Agualeguas (Nuevo León). These men acquired the weapons in the United States then passed them over the Rio Grande in boats. When they disembarked the weapons were then unloaded at the Los Guajes Ranch, owned by Jesus 'El Gavilan' Ramírez.\u000aFamily and acquaintances of these men relate that after hiding the weapons, the group was directed to travel to the Cantina de la Loma del Peligro bar, many miles down the highway leading from Mier to Ciudad Guerrero. There they met the buyer of the merchandise. In the bar it was agreed that the weapons would continue south, leaving Mier to Aldamas. From there they would travel to Veracruz where they would be loaded into a yacht named Granma.\u000aCastro later confirmed that the weapons leading to the Cuban revolution indeed passed through Mier with the help of Mexican smugglers.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Abandonment ==\u000aCiudad Mier was largely abandoned in 2010 due to the bloody turf war between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas after the death of Antonio Cárdenas Guillén, the drug boss of the Gulf organization. The fight between the drug cartels resulted in the death or kidnapping of all the police forces in the municipality of Ciudad Mier.\u000aApproximately 95% of the population left Ciudad Mier and went to Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas, as a result of the violence generated by the drug cartels in the Mexican Drug War. Consequently, the president of Mexico, Felipe Calderón, ordered the creation of a military headquarters in the area, and now more than 600 military elements patrol the streets of Mier.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Municipal presidents of the city ==\u000aNicolás Farías (1930\u20131933)\u000aSevero Barrera (1934\u20131936)\u000aJesús García Gutiérrez (1937\u20131940)\u000aFlorentino Ramírez Canales (1941\u20131942)\u000aAgustín Hinojosa Hinojosa (1943\u20131945)\u000aValentín Barrera (1946\u20131948)\u000aMarcial Garza Sarabia (1949\u20131951)\u000aJulio Ramírez-Mateo García (1952\u20131954)\u000aGerónimo Ramírez (1955\u20131957)\u000aMarco Hinojosa Villela (1958\u20131960)\u000aÁlvaro Barrera Garza (1961\u20131962)\u000aLeonte Garza y Garza (1963\u20131965)\u000aMauro Smith Bazán (1966\u20131968)\u000aÁlvaro Barrera Garza (1969\u20131971)\u000aRoel Ramírez Ayala (1972\u20131974)\u000aFrancisco Rodríguez Cavázos (1975\u20131977)\u000aVladimir Treviño Rodríguez (1978\u20131980)\u000aRoberto González Guajardo (1981\u20131983)\u000aIgnacio Peña Alemán (1984\u20131986)\u000aÁlvaro Barrera Ramírez (1987\u20131989)\u000aJesús Humberto Hinojosa Vivanco (1990\u20131992)\u000aEnrique Maldonado Quintanilla (1993\u20131995)\u000aJesús Ángel Guerra Mancías (1996\u20131998)\u000aJesús Humberto Hinojosa Vivanco.

aVErnest Alfred "Ernie" Izzard (25 February 1905 \u2013 December 1970) was a British boxer who was British lightweight champion between 1924 and 1925 and went on to fight for European and British Empire titles.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aBorn in Herne Hill, Izzard was nicknamed "The Herne Hill Hairpin" and began his professional career in 1920. Initially a featherweight, he was a contender for the British title at that weight and beat Jack Alexander in a title eliminator in February 1924. He moved up to lightweight and, after beating Tommy McInnes and Alf Mancini, fought Jack Kirk in November 1924 for the vacant British title, winning on points over twenty rounds. He successfully defended the title in April 1925 against Teddy Baker, and two months later faced Harry Mason with Izzard's British and Mason's European lightweight titles at stake; Izzard retired at the start of the ninth round, giving Mason both titles. He had three further fights that year - wins over Belgian champion Henri Dupont and Rene Kelly and a loss by fourth-round knockout to Ernie Rice.\u000aIzzard appeared in newspaper advertisements endorsing Virol (a bone-marrow preparation) in the mid 1920s, stating that having been born with a weight of only 3lbs and 2oz, taking the product had turned him into a championship boxer.\u000aIn 1928 he travelled to Australia for a series of fights starting with a draw with Charlie Purdy in January, a win over Irishman Bob Miller in April, and a win over Purdy in May. In June he challenged Tommy Fairhall for the British Empire lightweight title at the Sydney Stadium, losing on points over fifteen rounds.\u000aIzzard continued to fight regularly until the end of 1930. He had one drawn fight in 1931, four fights in 1932, then was out of the ring for three years before returning for two fights in 1935 before retiring. In a career in which he had at least 126 fights, he won 95, 31 by knockout.\u000aIn 1932 he was appointed to the position of boxing coach for the Oxford University Boxing Club.\u000aErnie Izzard died in December 1970, aged 65.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aCareer record at boxrec.com\u000aCareer record at boxinghistory.org.uk

aVMeco (real name Domenico Monardo; born November 29, 1939) is an American record producer and musician, as well as the name of his band or production team. Meco is best known for his 1977 space disco version of the Star Wars theme from his album Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk; both the single and album were certified platinum in the U.S.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aMeco Monardo was born in Johnsonburg, Pennsylvania, to parents of Italian descent. Building model ships, science fiction and movies were some of his boyhood preoccupations. His father played the valve trombone in a small Italian band, and through him Meco got his first musical education. Meco wanted to play the drums, but his father convinced him that the trombone was the right instrument, and at nine that was the instrument with which he was to stay. However, for Meco, the slide trombone was his choice, troublesome as it was for the small-statured boy to extend the slide fully at first. He joined the high school band while still attending elementary school. At 17, he won a scholarship to the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, which provided him with a solid classical and jazz music education. There, together with his two friends Chuck Mangione and Ron Carter, he started the Eastman School of Music jazz band. When he enrolled at West Point, he also played in the Cadet Band.\u000aOut of the army Meco moved to New York City and joined Kai Winding in his four-trombone band, and then from 1965 to 1974 he went on as a studio musician. Originally not inclined toward pop music, Meco's heart changed when he heard Petula Clark's "Downtown." He began doing arrangements, for example the horn section on Tommy James' "Crystal Blue Persuasion" and the Neil Diamond series of Coke commercials. As a session musician he played the trombone with acts like Tommy James, Diana Ross, and David Barretto. Although Meco focused on producing in the late 1970s, he contracted the horns and performed on Diana Ross' 1980 album Diana as a favor to producer (and neighbor) Nile Rodgers. His solo on the single "I'm Coming Out" is notable because of the rarity of trombone features on post-big-band era pop records.\u000aAround 1973, Meco, Tony Bongiovi, and a third person formed the production company Disco Corporation of America, and, from 1974 to 1976, Meco worked as a record producer. The team of Meco, Bongiovi, Jay Ellis, and Harold Wheeler produced the 1974 Gloria Gaynor hit "Never Can Say Goodbye." Carol Douglas' "Doctor's Orders" was among the other productions of that period.\u000aAccording to Meco:\u000a\u000a"When disco was new, it was fresh and exciting because it was different. But pretty soon it became too cookie-cutter and wore itself out."\u000a\u000aMeco temporarily left the music industry in 1985. After three years of "doing nothing but playing golf" he started to work as a commodity broker in Florida.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Star Wars theme ==\u000aOn Wednesday May 25, 1977, Meco watched the 20th Century-Fox soon-to-be blockbuster hit Star Wars on its opening day. By Thursday night, he had seen the film four more times, and attended several more screenings over the weekend.\u000aHe then got the idea to make a disco version of the score by John Williams and contacted Neil Bogart at Casablanca Records to pitch the project. Only after both the picture itself as well as the original score had become huge hits did Bogart agree to help Meco realize his idea. Contact was established with Millennium Records, then a Casablanca subsidiary, and this became Meco's first record company. Here Meco rejoined with Tony Bongiovi as well as Harold Wheeler who had also been part of the team behind "Never Can Say Goodbye" in 1974. Lance Quinn was also part of the Meco team, and the different roles played by the four musicians is described by Meco himself in a 1999 interview with his fan Web site:\u000aIn a matter of just three weeks they arranged and recorded Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk. Although the album was nominated for "Best Instrumental Pop performer" in 1977, the award ultimately went to John Williams for the original soundtrack album.\u000a\u000a\u000a== The band Meco ==\u000aFor a period of four months there was even a show band assembled to perform to Meco's disco music in public venues. However, the band was not involved in the making of the music. This initiative was organized by Norby Walters, a booking agent for discos. The band members (pictured in this article) toured the U.S. and Canada as a high energy show band called Lemon Tree. Norby Walters booked and also managed the band before the Star Wars project. Band personnel was Carmine Giovinazzo, Stan Glogicheski, Tommy Rocco, Tony Abruzzo, and Tony "Butch" Gerace.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other soundtracks become "Meco-ized" ==\u000aIn the fall of 1977, Meco's second album was released. It was another rearranged science-fiction movie soundtrack, Encounters of Every Kind, based on John Williams music of the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, from which three singles were released: "Topsy," "Meco's Theme," and "Theme from \u2018Close Encounters.\u2019"\u000aMeco's third album came in early 1978, and this time it was the music from The Wizard of Oz, which got transformed into a disco album by the same name, as Meco described: "It is my best work, bar none." From this album came the hit single "Themes from The Wizard of Oz: \u2018Over the Rainbow'/\u2018We're off to See the Wizard.'"\u000aIn the fall of 1978, Millennium merged with RCA. Since he had developed a deep-bonded working relationship with Neil Bogart and other staff at Casablanca Records (Millennium and Casablanca having cooperated closely), Meco decided to move to Casablanca.\u000aCasablanca released the fourth Meco album, Superman & Other Galactic Heroes, featuring two hit singles, "Superman Theme" and "Love Theme From Superman." This was yet another Meco makeover of an original John Williams score.\u000aIn 1979, the fifth album, Moondancer, was released, and with it the hit singles "Moondancer," "Grazing in the Grass," and "Devil's Delight."\u000aIn 1980, Meco's sixth album, Music From "Star Trek" & Music from "The Black Hole," was released, featuring the song "Theme From 'Star Trek.'" The movie Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) featured an original soundtrack composed by Jerry Goldsmith. Meco also created Meco Plays Music from The Empire Strikes Back, which was a 10" EP containing a mash-up of various themes from the John Williams score to The Empire Strikes Back.\u000aThe last album that Meco made for Casablanca, his seventh, which came out in 1981, was Impressions of An American Werewolf in London, based on the soundtrack from the 1981 movie An American Werewolf in London. After this Meco's tenure with Casablanca was over, and he signed with RCA Records.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Albums ===\u000aStar Wars and Other Galactic Funk (1977)\u000aEncounters of Every Kind (1977)\u000aMeco Plays The Wizard of Oz (1978)\u000aSuperman & Other Galactic Heroes (1978)\u000aMoondancer (1979)\u000aMeco Plays Music from The Empire Strikes Back (10" EP \u2013 1980)\u000aChristmas in the Stars: Star Wars Christmas Album (1980)\u000aMusic From Star Trek and Music From The Black Hole (1980)\u000aAcross The Galaxy (1980)\u000aImpressions of An American Werewolf in London (1981)\u000aPop Goes The Movies (1982)\u000aSwingtime's Greatest Hits (1982)\u000aEwok Celebration (1983)\u000aHooked on Instrumentals (1983)\u000aThe Best of Meco (1997)\u000aThe Complete Star Wars Collection (2000)\u000aStar Wars Party (2005) (This release is only sold on the Internet, a retail release with identical musical content was released as Music Inspired by "Star Wars")\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Singles ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Charted singles ====\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Additional singles ====\u000a"Topsy"\u000a"Meco's Theme"\u000a"Superman Theme"\u000a"Love Theme From Superman"\u000a"Moondancer"\u000a"Grazing in the Grass"\u000a"Devil's Delight"\u000a"Theme From Star Trek" (1980)\u000a"The Raiders March and Cairo Nights" (1981)\u000a"Anything Goes / Music Makers" (1984)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000aWhitburn, Joel.

aVWilliam Carl Garner (June 1, 1915 \u2013 July 6, 2014) was an American engineer. He served as resident engineer of Greers Ferry Lake since its construction in 1959, and in that capacity, he organized a citizen cleanup of the area which expanded to the Carl Garner Federal Lands Cleanup Day. The attention the program has received has also made people more aware of the problem of litter and preservation of the environment during the entire year.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aGarner was born in Moorefield, Arkansas, the son of Burton John Garner and Minnie Pearl Morgan. He was the first born out of six raised on a farm near Sulphur Rock, Arkansas. Carl attended Sulphur Rock High School and was salutatorian of his class when he graduated. Because of his basketball record he received a basketball scholarship from Arkansas College (now Lyon College), which he attended and graduated from in 1938 with a degree in economics. His first wife was Ruth Elizabeth Wade, daughter of Ernest Wade and Lizzie Estella Leggett. They were married September 18, 1940 and had a son. His second wife, Ima Jean "Jean" Reedy, also worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. They were married in 1972.\u000aGarner's 43-year career with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Little Rock Division, began in 1938 at Pocahontas, Arkansas. He worked in the survey, mapping, estimating, construction and operational branches in Missouri and Arkansas. Chief construction projects he worked on were Bull Shoals, Table Rock and Greers Ferry. In 1962 he became resident engineer in charge of operations and maintenance of the Greers Ferry Project, a position he held until his death.\u000aGarner received numerous awards in recognition of his work. Some of there are: 1963-Social Service Award for preparation of President John F. Kennedy's dedication of the Greers Ferry Project and the guided tour following the dedication; 1967-President's Citation, National Water Safety Congress for outstanding efforts in water safety; 1977-Corps of Engineers Meritorious Service Award and Bronze Medal; special appreciation awards from governors David Pryor and Bill Clinton, and Congressman Bill Alexander; 1979-Award of Excellence from Chief of Engineers as No. 1 Resident Engineer out of 440 Corps of Engineers lakes.\u000aGarner is best known for his development of the Greers Ferry Lake recreational facilities. In 1969 he led the Greers Ferry Lake and Little Red River Tourism Association's first-annual lake shore cleanup program, which has been nationally acclaimed, receiving the Keep America Beautiful Award twice and placing five times. In 1983 Carl Garner was named Arkansas Tourism Person of the Year. In 1984 the Keep America Beautiful first National Public Lands Cleanup Day launched, using the Greers Ferry Lake and Little Red River Tourism Association's annual cleanup as its model. In 1983 the William Carl Garner Visitor Center opened near the dam, telling the story of the Little Red River and the dam development.\u000aHe was a fellow in the American Society of Civil Engineers, member of the U.S. Committee on Large Dams and National Trails Council, Vice-President and member of the National Water Safety Congress. Other than professional organizations he was a member of the Board of Associates of Arkansas College; Advisory Board of Foothills Vocational Tech School; Official Board of First United Methodist Church of Heber Springs; and the building committee and service on the Board of Governors for Cleburne County Hospital.\u000aDuring Carl Garner's more than 57 years of service to the Corps of Engineers in Arkansas, he headed preparations for the dedication of Greers Ferry Dam by President John F. Kennedy and introduced many families to the outdoors.\u000aThe William Carl Garner Visitor Center was named after him and is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Visitor Center for Greers Ferry Lake. The center is located on Highway 25 North just west of Greers Ferry Dam near Heber Springs, Arkansas.\u000aHe died July 6, 2014 in White County Medical Center in Searcy, White County, Arkansas. He was buried July 2014 in Cleburne County Memorial Gardens in Heber Springs, Cleburne County, Arkansas.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aCarl Garner Obituary\u000aCarl Garner Tribute\u000aCarl Garner and Greers Ferry Lake\u000aWilliam Carl Garner Findagrave\u000aA Southern Mosaic by Mary P.

aVThe Mond process, sometimes known as the carbonyl process, is a technique created by Ludwig Mond in 1890, to extract and purify nickel. The process was used commercially before the end of the 19th century. This process converts nickel oxides into pure nickel.\u000aThis process involves the fact that carbon monoxide combines with nickel readily and reversibly to give nickel carbonyl. No other element forms a carbonyl compound under the mild conditions used in the process.\u000aThis process has three steps:\u000a1. Nickel oxide reacts with Syngas at 200 °C to give nickel, together with impurities including iron and cobalt.\u000aNiO(s) + H2(g) \u2192 Ni(s) + H2O(g)\u000a2. The impure nickel reacts with carbon monoxide at 50\u201360 °C to form the gas nickel carbonyl, leaving the impurities as solids.\u000aNi(s) + 4 CO(g) \u2192 Ni(CO)4(g)\u000a3. The mixture of nickel carbonyl and Syngas is heated to 220\u2013250 °C, resulting in decomposition back to nickel and carbon monoxide:\u000aNi(CO)4(g) \u2192 Ni(s) + 4 CO(g)\u000aSteps 2 and 3 illustrate a chemical transport reaction, exploiting the properties that (1) carbon monoxide and nickel readily combine to give a volatile complex and (2) this complex degrades back to nickel and carbon monoxide at higher temperatures. The decomposition may be engineered to produce powder, but more commonly an existing substrate is coated with nickel. For example, nickel pellets are made by dropping small, hot pellets through the carbonyl gas; this deposits a layer of nickel onto the pellets.\u000aThis process has also been used for plating nickel onto other metals, where a complex shape or sharp corners have made precise results difficult to achieve by electroplating. Although the results are good, the toxicity makes it impractical as an industrial process. Such parts are now plated by electroless nickel plating instead.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000acarbonyl metallurgy\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000a"Nickel: The Essentials".

aVPassenger rail franchising in Great Britain is the system of contracting out the operation of the passenger services on the railways of Great Britain to private companies through a system of franchising.\u000aThe system was created in the 1990s as part of the privatisation of British Rail, the former state owned railway operator, and involves franchises being awarded by the government to train operating companies (TOCs) through a process of competitive tendering. Franchises usually last for a minimum of seven years and cover a defined geographic area or service type; by design, franchises are not awarded on an exclusive basis, and day-to-day competition with other franchises and open access operators is possible, albeit occurring on a limited number of services. Over the years, the system has evolved, most notably reducing the initial total of 25 franchises down to 17 through a series of mergers, but it still continues to be the main form of passenger rail service provision in terms of route miles. A limited number of urban services are privately run, but are awarded by the local authority.\u000aThe system only covers the railways of Great Britain (and the Isle of Wight); the railways in Northern Ireland are owned and operated by the state-owned company NI Railways.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Process ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Tendering, monitoring and termination ===\u000aRailway franchises are decided by the UK Government's Department for Transport (DfT), who design the boundaries and terms of service, and award contracts to the train operating companies.\u000aPrior to formally tendering a specific franchise, the DfT publishes a Prior Information Notice (PIN) outlining the basic details, and opens a consultation with relevant transport authorities, devolved administrations and the Transport Focus watchdog. At the end of this process, a formal Invitation To Tender (ITT) setting out the detailed terms of the proposed franchise agreement is sent to the three to five prospective bidders who have been identified as pre-qualified. ITT's may include a range of variations for consideration by the prospective bidder, who may also submit variations themselves. The franchise is awarded to the bid which is deemed most viable, and which offers the best value and reliability. If relevant, bidders' past performance is also considered.\u000aPerformance is monitored throughout the contract period.\u000aIn contrast to earlier bail-outs, following the 2004 changes in approach to cost/revenue risk, unless there are exceptional circumstances, the DfT's policy toward failing franchises is to not rescue them with further financial assistance. Instead, DfT will hold them to the agreement and terminate the franchise early, and then run the franchise directly as an operator of last resort (OOLR), pending a re-tendering. Agreements also contain a cross-default clause, which allows other franchises also held by the company or an affiliate to be terminated.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Financing ===\u000aRail franchise holders in Great Britain accept commercial risk, although there are clauses in newer franchises which offer some compensation for lower-than-expected revenue (and also claw back some excess profits, should these occur).\u000aThe main costs incurred by franchisees are track access charges (paid to Network Rail); other significant costs come from staffing, leasing stations (from NR) and rolling stock (from ROSCOs). Franchisees also pay for light maintenance of stock, with heavy work being done as part of the ROSCO lease. The main revenue stream is from fares, or the franchise subsidy in cases where there is a shortfall. In addition, franchisees are allowed to directly sub-let commercial units in leased stations.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Franchises and concessions ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Current franchises ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Concessions ===\u000aA small number of urban railway systems are not franchised but are contracted out as a concession instead. Concession holders are paid a fee to run the service, which is usually tightly specified by the awarding authority. They do not take commercial risk, although there are usually penalties and rewards specified in the contract for large variations in performance.\u000aExamples\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Open-access operators ===\u000aIn addition to franchises and concessions, an Open access operator is a train operating company that is not subject to franchising, but instead purchasing individual slots on the mainline from a railway infrastructure company. These include Eurostar, Grand Central, Heathrow Connect, Heathrow Express and Hull Trains.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Former franchises ===\u000aPrior to privatisation, the passenger services of British rail were organised into three units:\u000aInterCity for long distance express services\u000aNetwork SouthEast (NSE) for the commuter services from South East England into the various London termini\u000aRegional Railways (RR) for services in all other areas\u000aThey then underwent further reorganisation in preparation for franchising, being split up into 25 train operating units (TOUs) or that were gradually incorporated as separate, shadow businesses operating as 'shadow franchises' that negotiated contracts individually with regulators, Railtrack (the infrastructure and major station owner) and ROSCOs (the rolling stock leasing companies) before being sold off in 1996 and 1997.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Genesis to sale ===\u000aThe franchising system was created by the Railways Act 1993 as part of the privatisation of British Rail by the Government of John Major, and the first franchises came into effect in 1996. Prior to this, the railway system had been owned and operated by the government-owned corporation British Rail (BR), which has since been wound up.\u000aPrime Minister John Major envisaged splitting up the railways and returning ownership to an equivalent of the Big Four railway companies that had existed before the creation of British Rail. The Treasury advocated an alternative plan put forward by the Adam Smith Institute which separated railway infrastructure from train service operation and contracted out passenger services to seven-year franchises. This scheme formed the basis of the system which was implemented, which saw the creation of 25 shadow franchises, to be sold off in a process managed by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising, which specified service levels and public subsidies that were to be paid to operators. The legislation allowed BR to bid for franchises, if the DPRF agreed, but in practice he never did.\u000aUnder the original 1993 legislation, the Franchise Director set out the minimum service levels of a franchise in a Passenger Service Requirement (PSR), being the current BR timetable in the case of the first sell-offs, and put this out to competitive tender. Winning bidders were decided on a pure cost basis \u2013 those who offered to pay the highest premium, or receive lowest subsidy, would run the franchise. Once signed, franchise agreements could only be terminated under certain conditions, namely not meeting the PSR, although fines were available as an intermediate step.\u000aThe Treasury had initially envisaged franchises to be around 3 years long, to promote sustained competition, however as it became clear that potential buyers were not interested in such short terms, it was announced in 1995 that franchises would be around 5 to 7 years long, or longer if major investment was required. The first franchise agreements to be signed were for the South West and Great Western franchises, on 19 and 20 December 1995 respectively. The first passenger train service operated by a privatised franchise was the South West Trains 05;10 Twickenham to Waterloo on 4 February 1996, although this came after the first privately run service, which ironically was a rail replacement bus service covering the early morning Fishguard to Cardiff journey in South Wales, due to engineering works.\u000aAs the program progressed, all franchises had been awarded and commenced by 1 April 1997, the last being ScotRail. OPRAF was initially criticised for taking too long, but answered that most of the delays were outside of their control, and were indeed caused by the government itself. The first four franchise competitions only attracted four bidders each, well below government expectations, although competition increased as the program went on and investors gained more surety over the way the system was to operate as a whole. Ultimately, although there were 25 franchises, the eventual buyers came from only 13 different companies. Many were bus companies, with the hoped-for interest from airlines and shipping groups failing to be converted into solid bids. In addition, despite several bids, due to difficulties in raising finance, only three bids from management buyout groups had been successful.\u000aNational Express was the winner of the most franchises, with five (Gatwick Express, Midland Mainline, North London, Central Trains and ScotRail). Prism Rail came next, with four (LTS, Wales & West, Valley Lines and WAGN). Connex, Virgin Rail Group and MTL all captured two each, with the franchises they won being closely related (South Central and South Eastern for Connex, CrossCountry and West Coast for Virgin, and Mersey Electrics and North East for MTL). Stagecoach also won two, although the second was the tiny Island Line, which would eventually be merged with their main win, South West Trains. Great Western Holdings also won two, on opposite sides of the country \u2013 Great Western and North Western; FirstGroup, who had won a single franchise in Great Eastern, were a minority partner in GWH. Their March 1998 buyout of the other GWH partners increased their total to three.\u000aIn the end, most of the franchises were awarded for lengths from 7 to 7 and a half years. Only seven franchises were longer \u2013 two for 10 years (Great Western and Midland Mainline), and five for 15 years (LTS, Gatwick Express, South Eastern, Cross Country and West Coast). Only one was shorter, the 5 year award for Island Line.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1997\u20132010 ===\u000a\u000aThe Labour government elected in 1997 chose not to reverse the privatisation process, although they set out a number of reform proposals, including the setting up of a new Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), whose functions would absorb the responsibilities of the Franchising Director, as well as some duties previously performed by the Rail Regulator and the Department of Transport's Railways Directorate. Since this would take time as it involved legislation, in the meantime the SRA was established in 'shadow' form, in June 1999. Part of their brief was to ensure the railways operated as "a coherent network, not merely a collection of different franchises". Their goals were closely aligned with the government's wider objectives, set out in July 2000 as the ten-year plan, Transport 2010.\u000aIn 2000 the shadow SRA announced plans to use the re-franchising of the 18 shorter term (7-year) franchises expiring by 2004 to make various changes aimed at improving service grouping and lengthening franchises, with the aim of making them more robust and better able to invest in services. It aimed to have these proposals agreed by Autumn 2001, and published a timetable for the letting of 9 franchises in three tranches. These long-term plans were disrupted in 2001/2 by the impact of the Hatfield rail crash, which led to the nationalisation of Railtrack, the owner of the railway infrastructure, to create Network Rail. On 1 February 2001, the position of Franchising Director was abolished by the Transport Act 2000 and the passenger rail franchising functions were formally transferred to the SRA.\u000aThe SRA began to doubt its new long-term strategy as it failed to negotiate a 20-year franchise for the East Coast due to uncertainty over Railtack's ability to finance planned upgrades, and abandoned bidding negotiations in July 2001 after 21 months. Instead it elected for a short 2-year extension, hoping the situation would be clearer by then. Short-term extensions were also to be considered for other 7-year franchise renegotiations facing similar issues, which had not yet reached a finalised agreement.\u000aBy the end of 2002, the SRA had also changed its policy on Franchising Agreements to introduce various other performance criteria in addition to keeping to the PSR, aimed at raising the overall quality of passenger journeys. Franchise lengths would be kept to between five and eight years, but extensions would be permitted if Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were met. It also changed the approach to risks in costs and revenues, and introduced incentive payments for performance and long term investment. The changes took effect after the awards for the Transpennine and Wales & Borders franchises, which were already too advanced. The tendering process was also simplified, giving more details up front in order to speed up the process and make bid assessment more robust. Through the use of tactical short-term extensions, the SRA planned to achieve the changes in franchise redesign and smooth out the timetable for re-franchising, aiming for two or three awards per year.\u000aIn February 2002, the Chiltern franchise became the first to be awarded for a 20-year duration, the winning bidder being Chiltern Railways, the incumbent franchisee since privatisation.\u000aIn August 2003, FirstGroup purchased GB Railways, the first time since privatisation that a TOC had been bought by another TOC.\u000aThe Railways Act 2005 abolished the SRA and transferred the responsibility for franchises in England and Wales directly to the government through the Secretary of State for Transport, with the Welsh Government being given a direct role over services in Wales. Responsibility for the ScotRail franchise was passed to the Scottish Government. The 2005 Act also gave local and devolved administrations the ability to alter fares up or down, provided they funded the extra cost, or used the savings on other transport modes. In a move designed to make them accountable for their decisions in this new role, English passenger transport executives were no longer direct parties to franchise agreements, instead gaining a role in long-term planning and a statutory right to consultation over franchises in their areas. In London, the Act required the DfT to consult Transport for London on any franchise with services to, from or within London. In July 2007, these powers were extended, with measures designed to protect those outside London, with the DfT as the arbiter of disputes.\u000aIn October 2007, the European Union set the maximum length of a rail franchise at 22.5 years: 15 years initially, with a 50% extension in certain circumstances.\u000aBy 2007 the Labour government was happy with how the franchise system was leading to improvements in customer satisfaction and better trains, crediting TOC's use of their freedoms under the system to deliver passenger growth. The 2008 recession sparked fears over franchisees' ability to survive, although the government allayed these fears in 2009.\u000aPassenger Rail Franchising has been examined by the National Audit Office and a report was published on 15 October 2008.\u000aIn response to continuing criticism, changes in how franchises were agreed and monitored continued; by 2010 agreements contained penalties for failure to increase reliability, and the number of KPIs had been reduced.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2010\u2013present ===\u000a\u000aThe coalition government elected in May 2010 paused re-franchising pending a review, which was published in January 2011. As a result, they reformed the system further to increase operators' flexibility, with greater incentives for cost reduction by operators, and franchise terms dealt with on a case-by-case approach. They extended the standard franchise term to between 15 and 22.5 years (with shorter terms where expedient), ending the Cap and Collar approach to risk which provided for risk-sharing with government regarding future demand, and introducing profit sharing and review points. The new system, to be applied first with the InterCity West Coast bid, also took a less prescriptive approach to service specification and introduced measures to tackle crowding and changes to the way quality measurement was approached. Because of the increased future risks carried by operators, the government required a large financial surety to discourage early contract default.\u000aIn 2012 the franchising system essentially collapsed in the wake of the West Coast controversy (see below). As a result of the crisis, the government commissioned two inquiries, the Laidlaw inquiry to look into the cause of the West Coast failure, and the Brown review to investigate the wider franchise system. The Laidlaw report was published in December 2012, and found the DfT to be primarily responsible for the West Coast failure, having made several errors in its financial modelling. All three outstanding franchise competitions \u2013 Great Western, Essex Thameside and Thameslink \u2013 were paused pending the outcome of the Brown review. It was published in January 2013, and concluded there were no fundamental flaws in the system, but made 11 recommendations on how it could be improved. One recommendation was to spread out the re-franchising schedule to avoid bunching, which the government acted upon in committing to holding no more than four competitions per year, and staggering the East and West coast awards. Another of Brown's recommendations was the breaking up of the standard franchise period into two terms: an initial term of between 7 and 10 years, followed by an automatic extension of a further 3 to 5 years, should performance criteria have been met (but also possibly being granted if they weren't, to dissuade abuse by under-performing TOCs). It also recommended further transfer of powers to local and devolved administrations.\u000aThe West Coast controversy led to the introduction of the Direct Award concept, whereby the government can award a franchise that is up for renewal directly to the incumbent rather than through a tendering process, but only if the operator's proposed terms match the government's projected expectations of future performance based on its past record. If a reasonable contract cannot be drawn up through negotiation, the franchise is then re-let as normal. In the following few years, most franchises were renewed as Direct Awards, in part to achieve the smoothing-out of the schedule recommended by Brown.\u000aFollowing the pause for the Brown report, the system resumed in 2013; the DfT published a revised timetable in March 2013, with the first tender being concluded in May, the Direct Award for the Essex Thameside franchise.\u000aIn 2014, the DfT was re-organised, with responsibility for rail franchising becoming part of the new Office of Rail Passenger Services's remit under an externally recruited chief, the ORPS itself being part of a new Rail Executive within the DfT.\u000aIn January 2015, as part of its statutory duty to promote competition, the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) launched a policy review to determine if there were opportunities to improve the current system outside the established areas of competition, namely the bidding process and the open access operators. In July 2015 it identified four possible areas for reform: an increased role for open access operators, having two successful bidders for each franchise, having more overlapping franchises and having multiple operators with licences on each route. The regulator (by then renamed the Office of Rail & Road) evaluated the CMA's options, leading to a final report in March 2016.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Competition inquiries ==\u000aWhenever there is a possibility through the franchising process for multiple franchises to come into the common ownership of a larger transport group, these can lead to referrals to the competition authorities for investigation (currently the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA)), if it is deemed there is a concern that market dominance might result in a monopoly. This can also be triggered when there is an overlap between train and bus services in a particular area or corridor (most bus and coach services in Great Britain having been privatised in the 1980s).\u000aMany investigations are cancelled without conclusion, simply because the concerning situation does not arise (i.e. a different company wins the bid). Investigations are also often closed with no action, after it is found there is little concern (such as in cases where the operator has little-to-no ability to create a monopoly situation in practice, even though they may control large areas of services). Where a concern is found to be significant, it is often resolved through the operators agreeing to certain undertakings designed to prevent the monopoly situation occurring, although in some cases investigations will conclude there is no alternative but to block the proposed contract.\u000aInvestigations which resulted in undertakings are as follows:\u000aStagecoach / East Coast (2015)\u000aArriva / Wales & Borders (2004)\u000aFirst / ScotRail (2004)\u000aNational Express' acquisition of Prism Rail (2000)\u000aNational Express / Midland Main Line (1996)\u000aIn February 2017 the Transport Select Committee concluded that the rail franchising model was "no longer fit for purpose" and was failing passengers, and recommended that the Transport Secretary Chris Grayling should instigate an independent review.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Controversies ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Public/private ownership ===\u000aAccording to the Railways Act 1993, the public sector cannot bid for rail franchises in Great Britain, although some rail franchises in the past have been taken on temporarily by a state-owned operation following an unsuccessful private franchise.\u000aSome critics of the franchising system have suggested that state-owned organisations, such as the Government-owned holding company set up to take temporary ownership of franchises, Directly Operated Railways, should be allowed to tender for rail franchises on a permanent basis. They highlight the fact that many of the current rail franchise holders are actually joint ventures involving subsidiary companies of the state-owned railways of other countries, such as SNCF of France or the German Deutsche Bahn.\u000aSome commentators have criticised the re-franchising deals by comparing the performance of the private-sector franchisees unfavourably with the public-sector operators. Advocates of the franchising system contrast public-sector operations with commercial operators, citing their ability to invest private capital into the franchises, financial returns to the Treasury and customer incentives such as free on-board wi-fi and loyalty card schemes.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== West Coast upgrade delay (2012) ===\u000aIn the wider context of the controversy over Railtrack's failure to upgrade the West Coast Main Line, this led to criticism of the SRA for failing to ensure the Cross Country and West Coast franchises transitioned from subsidised to premium paying franchises. This had been anticipated in the initial 15 year franchise agreements (1997 to 2012), but depended on Railtrack delivering the upgrade on time. Instead, the delays meant the contracts had to be renegotiated early as management contracts, and continued to be subsidised for several years until they could be re-let, which was seen as a cost to the public purse, adding millions to the billions run up in over-spend on the upgrade itself. The initial management contracts came into effect on 22 July 2002, and would see the West Coast franchise supported by the SRA until March 2003, and if agreement on a new franchise terms was not reached by then, it would continue as a management contract, in return for a fee of 2% of revenue. Similarly, Cross Country would be supported until March 2004, and then by a 1% fee if not renegotiated, but with the option of the SRA putting it out to tender. Unhappy with Virgin's proposal for terms of the remainder of the original 15 year Cross Country franchise, the SRA terminated negotiations on 6 August 2004. The temporary arrangements continued until the franchise was re-let in a revised form, announced in October 2005. Although Virgin was shortlisted as a bidder for this revised franchise, it lost out to Arriva, who took over as the new franchisee from 11 November 2007.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== West Coast re-tendering (2012) ===\u000a\u000aIn 2012 the franchising system ran into some difficulty; the Department for Transport awarded the InterCity West Coast franchise to FirstGroup, but in October the Secretary of State for Transport reversed this decision after significant technical flaws had been revealed in the way the franchise process was conducted. Since then, Virgin Trains has been given a temporary management contract to run the franchise until a fresh competition can be run.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Failed InterCity East Coast franchise (2006) ===\u000a\u000aIn December 2006, the Great North Eastern Railway TOC operating the InterCity East Coast franchise was stripped of its contract six years before it would have expired, due to financial difficulties at its parent company Sea Containers. It was eventually re-tendered to the National Express East Coast TOC in August 2007, GNER having been allowed to operate it in the interim on a management contract basis. NXEC then in turn also got into difficulties due to the recession and was forced to relinquish the franchise after the government refused to renegotiate its terms. In November 2009 the franchise was handed over to a newly created and publicly owned East Coast TOC, before eventually being re-tendered to a new TOC, Virgin Trains East Coast, in March 2015.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Bidding process (2003) ===\u000aThe 2003 purchase of GB Railways by FirstGroup was seen by some as an attempt by First to bypass the franchising system \u2013 GB were the holders of the Anglia Railways franchise, which was undergoing re-tendered at the time \u2013 First had already been rejected for the shortlist of three bidders, which included the incumbent. Responding to media criticism that he had been "outmaneuvered" by First, the head of the SRA argued that he could not decide who would become a preferred bidder based on what might happen in future regarding mergers and acquisitions. The purchase went through, but GB was unsuccessful in winning the Anglia franchise, as well as two others it was also bidding for (Northern and Wales & Borders).\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Failed Network SouthCentral franchise (2003) ===\u000aIn October 2000, after passenger complaints, the SRA announced that Connex would be losing its contract to run the Network SouthCentral franchise on its expiry in 2003, which it had been operating through its Connex South Central TOC. Having announced the new operator (from 2003) would be Southern, a Govia subsidiary, the South Central TOC was sold to Govia in 2001 as a way of terminating their involvement early and cutting their losses. In November 2003, Connex was stripped of its only other UK rail operation, the Connex South Eastern TOC running the South Eastern franchise, eight years before it would have expired, due to poor financial management. It was replaced by a new, publicly owned TOC, South Eastern Trains; with the franchise eventually returned to the private sector through re-tendering, which saw it pass to the Southeastern TOC April 2006 as part of the newly created Integrated Kent franchise.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aTrain operating company (that included a detailed timeline of changes to rail franchises since 1994)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aRail franchising \u2013 Department for Transport\u000aRail passenger franchising up to October 2012 \u2013 Department for Transport, February 2013

aVThe Bristol Scout F was a British single-seat biplane fighter built in 1916 to use newer and more powerful engines. It was initially powered by the Sunbeam Arab, but the third prototype was used as a testbed for the Cosmos Mercury, marking the start of Roy Fedden's association with the Bristol Aeroplane Company. The Armistice ended hopes of production.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Development ==\u000aBy the end of 1916 there was a shortage of suitably powerful engines for single-seat fighters needed for air superiority. One of the few available was the Hispano-Suiza, but this was reserved for the SE5a and was unreliable. Frank Barnwell of the Bristol Aeroplane Company designed a single-seat biplane, called the Scout E, around a proposed 200 hp (149 kW) ten-cylinder water-cooled radial engine designed by Harry Ricardo and Frank Halford, but this failed to materialise and another powerplant was sought. The Company gained an Air Ministry contract for six aircraft and promised some 200 hp Hispano-Suizas, but by June 1917 these had been replaced by 200 hp Sunbeam Arabs. With the Arab engine the design was redesignated the Scout F.\u000aThe Scout F was a single-bay biplane with staggered unequal-span wings with straight edges and rounded tips. Ailerons were carried only on the upper planes and there were smooth cutouts in both to improve the view from the open cockpit, placed just behind the trailing edge. The tail was conventional, with unbalanced control surfaces. The Scout F had a fuselage-mounted single-axle main undercarriage forward of the lower wing, plus a tailskid. The water-cooled V-8 Arab engine allowed a smooth and quite short installation, ending in a two-blade propeller and conical spinner. There was a small bulge on top of the cowling for the coolant header tank and the radiator was placed in a tunnel fairing between the undercarriage legs, with a pair of shutters for coolant temperature control.\u000aPersistent vibrations dogged the Arab and a decision was made to use it only in the first two Scout Fs, the first of which first flew in March 1918. It was fast, achieving 138 mph (222 km/h) at sea level, and could climb to 10,000 ft (3,050 m) in 9.5 min. The second was flown by experienced pilots at the Central Flying School, amongst them Oliver Stuart who judged it a better aerobatic airplane than the SE5a.\u000a\u000aAt this point Barnwell was approached by Roy Fedden of the Cosmos Engineering company based in the Bristol suburb of Fishponds. Fedden wanted to find a suitable airframe to test the 315 hp (235 kW) Cosmos Mercury radial engine which he was developing, and it was decided to fit the third machine with this engine. It was installed inside a low-drag cowling with exposed cylinder heads, making the aircraft 10 in (40 mm) shorter than the Arab-powered machines. The weight went up by 60 lb (27 kg). In this form it was known as the Scout F.1 and it was first flown on 6 September 1918. The greater power produced a slightly higher top speed and a much better rate of climb.\u000a\u000aThe third Scout F was the last to fly, although a fourth aircraft was built as a spare airframe. The Armistice brought an end to the Mercury contract, the cancellation of the two outstanding Scout Fs, and the abandonment of hopes of its production.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Specifications (Mercury) ==\u000aData from Barnes 1970, p. 133\u000aGeneral characteristics\u000aCrew: one\u000aLength: 20 ft 0 in (6.10 m)\u000aWingspan: 29 ft 7 in (9.02 m)\u000aHeight: 8 ft 4 in (2.54 m)\u000aWing area: 260 ft2 (24.15 m2)\u000aEmpty weight: 1,440 lb (653 kg)\u000aGross weight: 2,260 lb (1,025 kg)\u000aPowerplant: 1 × Cosmos Mercury 14-cylinder air-cooled radial, 315 hp (235 kW)\u000aPerformance\u000aMaximum speed: at sea level 145 mph (233 km/h)\u000aRate of climb: to 10,000 ft (3,050 m) 1,850 ft/min ( m/s)\u000aArmament\u000a2×0.303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Notes ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Bibliography ===

aVIn campanology (bell ringing), a peal is the special name given to a specific type of performance of change ringing which meets certain exacting conditions for duration, complexity and quality.\u000aThe definition of a peal has changed considerably over the years and its standardisation was one of the motivating factors in the formation of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers in 1891. Currently, for a performance to be recognised as a peal by the Central Council it must consist of sufficient numerical sequences, or "changes" (at least 5040 changes on up to seven working bells or 5000 changes on higher numbers), meet a number of other criteria (collectively referred to as the decisions), and be published in The Ringing World.\u000aOn typical tower bells a peal takes around three hours to ring; the time depends on several factors including the number of changes and the weight of the bells, which affects the speed of ringing.\u000aIn addition to ordinary peals, ringers often ring quarter-peals, which are a quarter of the length of a full peal, making them easier to ring as most quarter-peals take around 45 minutes to complete.\u000aA set of English-style full-circle bells is sometimes erroneously called a peal of bells, but ringers use the term a ring of bells.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Historic meaning ==\u000a\u000aOriginally a peal referred to a sequence of changes of any length, now often referred to as a touch. A touch being more than a plain course, but not a quarter or full peal. However, the original meaning is still in use today in call-change ringing. The most famous and frequently rung call-change peal, associated with the Devon Association of ringers, is named 60 on 3rds.\u000aFollowing the invention of the ringing method known as Grandsire Doubles, the term peal or "full peal" was applied to the ringing of sequences including each possible permutation of the set of bells exactly once. On five bells (Doubles), there are 120 permutations taking about four minutes to ring on tower bells. This is arrived at by the calculation 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120 unique permutations. These figures rapidly increase as more bells are added.\u000aThe term "extent" is now preferred to peal in this context, excepting performances on seven bells where the terms peal and extent are now synonymous.\u000aThe extent on eight bells comprises 40,320 changes, and would be referred to today as a long length peal. Despite this, it has been successfully rung as a continuous performance both on tower and on hand bells, 17 hours in duration on tower bells.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Relationship of extents and peals ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Modern peal standards ==\u000aMethod Ringing peals today consist of a minimum length of between 5000 and 5280 changes, or permutations, depending on the method, and the number of bells.\u000aThe first method ringing peal in this modern sense took place at St Peter Mancroft Church in Norwich, in 1715, and was in the method "Grandsire Bob Triples", which is equivalent to the modern Plain Bob Triples. This is the earliest known record of a "full peal" which was "true" \u2013 that is, did not have any repeated changes \u2013 and was over 5,000 changes.\u000aThere is a long list of rules which been developed since 1890. To be classified as a peal, a performance must be in accordances with rules and decisions of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, allowing them to be recorded in that organisation\u2019s peal records. They must also be published in The Ringing World. The Central Council has two committees which are arbiters of the standards that peals must achieve:\u000aMethods committee\u000aPeal records committee\u000aSome key conditions required for all peals are:\u000aA peal shall start and end with rounds and shall be rung without interval.\u000aNo row shall be struck more than once before the next change is made.\u000aEvery bell must sound at every row throughout the peal.\u000aEach bell must be rung continuously by the same person or persons.\u000aFor handbells the bells shall be retained in hand.\u000aFor tower bells the bells shall be audible outside the building in which they are contained.\u000aNo assistance of any kind shall be given to any ringer by any person not ringing in the peal.\u000aThe use of physical aids to memory in conducting and ringing is not permitted.\u000aNo error in calling shall be corrected later than during the change at which the call or change of method or non-method block would properly take effect.\u000aAny shift or error in ringing shall be corrected immediately.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Challenges in ringing a peal ===\u000aPeals on tower bells can take anywhere from two and a half to over four hours to ring, depending on the weight of the bells. Handbell peals are shorter for equivalent changes. They are both a physical and mental challenge, as concentration has to be maintained for a long period of time, and each individual ringer has to ring their bell without a break.\u000aComposition of peals is a specialized and highly complicated area of change ringing, as it involves composing a peal according to the rules. The "Conductor" of the peal has to:\u000aControl and ring their own bell in the correct sequence\u000aCorrect other ringers if they go wrong\u000aCall the "bobs" and "singles" which are the "composition" \u2013 the equivalent of a musical score \u2013 that ensures the correct changes are rung in the correct sequence.\u000aA peal can fail at any point if there is a mix-up of bells which cannot be put right; this can happen only minutes from the end.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Popularity of 10-bell methods ==\u000aAccording to the best available knowledge in 2017, 6,929 peals of Grandsire Caters (on 10 bells) were rung in the 300 years after 11 January 1711. Grandsire Caters was the leading 10-bell method in each decade from 1711 to 1890, but Stedman Caters has proved more popular recently and on 9 July 2010 its cumulative peal total from 1711 pulled ahead of the running Grandsire total.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Long-length peals ==\u000aAnother area of peal ringing is that of long length peals. These involve ringing for far longer than an ordinary peal, up to 17 hours. The difficulties of ringing ordinary peals are magnified in these performances, as are the difficulties of composing them. One challenge to ringers is to ring 'the extent', which on eight bells is 40320 changes. The last time this was rung on tower bells, it took 18 hours.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Raising and lowering in peal ==\u000a"Raising in peal" does not refer to ringing a peal, but is the process where a band of ringers increases the swing of tower bells from mouth down to mouth upwards while keeping them ringing in rounds. The opposite process is "lowering in peal", where the swing of the bells is gradually reduced until they are at rest mouth downwards, again keeping the bells ringing in rounds throughout.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Quarter peal ==\u000aQuarter peals are also commonly rung, and are popular for service ringing, where a full peal would be time-consuming. These generally meet most of the rules for a peal, but need be only a quarter the length (i.e. at least 1260 or 1250 changes, depending on the number of bells).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Records of peals ==\u000aMany notable peals are also recorded on peal boards attached to the walls of the ringing rooms in the towers where they took place, and in the peal books of local change-ringing associations.\u000aThe Felstead database is an on-line searchable resource for all peal records.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aCentral Council decisions \u2014 scroll down the page to see the council's definition of a peal\u000aBellBoard - an online live listing of all contemporary peals and quarter peals

aVC. W. Smith (born 1940) is a novelist, short-story and essay writer who serves as a Dedman Family Distinguished Professor in the Department of English at Southern Methodist University.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000a\u000aC. W. Smith (full name Charles William Smith) was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, and grew up in Hobbs, New Mexico. He received a B.A. in English from the University of North Texas in 1964 and an M.A. in English from Northern Illinois University in 1967. After teaching at Southwest Missouri State University, he moved to Mexico for a year to work on his first novel, Thin Men of Haddam. Published by Viking/Grossman in 1973, the book won the Jesse H. Jones Award from the Texas Institute of Letters for the Best Novel by a Texan or about Texas and was recognized by the Southwestern Library Association for making a \u201cdistinguished contribution to an understanding of a vital social issue in the American Southwest.\u201d .\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aSmith has said that his goal since beginning his first novel has been \u201cto document in a dramatic fashion the cultural conflicts of the American Southwest as well as the universal, existential dilemmas that arise from being human regardless of place and time.\u201d  In pursuit of that goal, his second novel, set in West Texas among oil field workers and small-town citizens, sought to portray the lives of young people trapped in circumstances too small for their aspirations. That novel, Country Music (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1975), was optioned by Playboy Productions. The novel was reviewed widely with largely, though not universally, positive notices: "Smith's portrait of a troubled young man searching for himself he knows not where...is alive, funny, sad, and as real as it can be."  "The characters are convincing. The pace is unusually fast for a psychological novel. Smith is a writer of growing importance."  "C.W. Smith\u2019s technique has the impact of that of Claude Simon, the Provencal farmer-novelist who creates arresting amalgams of past, present, reverie and locale. Can\u2019t do much better than that. The New Yorker, on the other hand, posted that \u201cThis novel is easy to enjoy on a cartoon level, but only on that level\u2026\u201d\u000aLargely on the strength of the two novels, Smith was awarded a Dobie-Paisano Fellowship at the University of Texas, where he spent a year working on short stories. He was then hired to adapt the novel to the screen and spend time in Los Angeles working with producers on a script while his family resettled in Indianapolis. When the family returned to Texas, Smith became a reporter and film critic for The Dallas Times-Herald and subsequently began teaching at Southern Methodist University. His third novel, The Vestal Virgin Room (Atheneum, 1983), focused on a pair of married itinerant musicians, Mid-Westerners, whose efforts to secure fame in Las Vegas results in a strain in a marriage already under stress due to the loss of their only child. The novel has been optioned by three different producers with three different scripts, one by playwright Jonathan Tolins (\u201cThe Twilight of the Golds\u201d), and the latest by producer Ed Bates with a screenplay by playwright and screenwriter David Dean Bottrell (\u201cDearly Departed\u201d).\u000aSmith then embarked upon a long historical novel based loosely upon the life of an Osage who was called in the press in the 1920s and 1930s \u201cthe world\u2019s richest Indian.\u201d Buffalo Nickel was published in 1989 by Simon & Schuster after nearly a decade of writing and revision. "The destruction of native American cultures might be considered by some readers to be a literary dry hole. But this novel, about a Kiowa man who inadvertently becomes an Oklahoma oil millionaire, is a rich gusher of a novel - and consequently disproves any such notions\u2026.This is a big novel, in all senses - the characters and the incidents of their lives made memorably real."  "Critic Bruce Allen, writing in USA Today, said that \u201cBuffalo Nickel is a delightful rarity: an old-fashioned \u2018good read\u2019 which tells the life story of a likable and interesting character who truly grows and changes....The novel is a roomy, agreeably slow-paced picaresque whose serious themes (the abrading of Indian culture, the gradual disappearance of space and wilderness) emerge with haunting clarity from a prose that continuously suggests and dramatizes, never once breaking into sermon. Buffalo Nickel may well be the year's best novel.."\u000aDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Smith wrote non-fiction as well as novels and short stories. He was, briefly, the ethics columnist for Esquire and the film critic for Texas Monthly. As a freelance journalist and essayist, his work appeared in magazines and periodicals both scholarly and commercial. A cover article entitled \u201cUncle Dad\u201d published by Esquire  became a full-length memoir about his efforts to remain a part of his children\u2019s lives after a divorce. The book, commissioned and published by Putnam, was also released under the author\u2019s original title in a subsequent paperback edition by Berkley. His nonfiction work has been recognized through various awards: Special Merit Award for Feature Writing from the Penney-Missouri Foundation; the Stanley Walker Award for Journalism from the Texas Institute of Letters, and the award for Best Nonfiction Book by a Texan in 1987 from the Southwestern Booksellers Association.\u000aIn 1994, Texas Christian University Press began its long association with Smith\u2019s works through the publication of his short-story collection, Letters From the Horse Latitudes. Most of the stories in the collection were previously published, and his short fiction has appeared in Mademoiselle, Vision, Southwest Review, Sunstone Review, Carolina Quarterly, New Mexico Humanities Review, Quartet, Cimarron Review, American Literary Review, American Short Fiction, The Missouri Review, and descant. Writing about the collection in The New York Times, Benjamin Cheever said, \u201dSet in Mexico and the American Southwest, Mr. Smith's stories have a rugged informality. Their sense of intimacy is so great that the reader feels he has uncovered a cache of personal letters or is overhearing a late-night conversation between friends. And yet, like the stories of O. Henry, each is cleverly contrived to capture some essence of life and also to make a point. Today most O. Henry stories read like antiques, dependent for their effects on credulous readers and illuminated with false optimism. But the world that Mr. Smith dramatizes is both contemporary and convincing." .\u201d His stories have received the Frank O'Connor Memorial Short Story Award from Quartet; the John H. McGinnis Short Story Award from Southwest Review, as well as a Pushcart Prize nomination. An excerpt from his story \u201cThe Plantation Club\u201d was included in, \u201cSeeing Jazz: Artists and Writers on Jazz,\u201d published by Chronicle Books in the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (1997). His short story, \u201cThe Bundelays,\u201d was performed by Judith Ivey as part of the Dallas Museum of Arts\u2019 \u201cArts and Letters Live Series,\u201d as well as at sister programs in Denver and Houston.\u000aSmith\u2019s next novel, Hunter\u2019s Trap (TCU Press, 1996), was designed to be an oblique sequel to the earlier Buffalo Nickel and the second part of a projected trilogy treating the theme of Native American assimilation into Anglo-European culture after the defeat of the Plains tribes by the U.S. military in the last quarter of the 19th century. \u201cSomewhat reminiscent of the stories of Jim Harrison\u2026Smith's novel offers an evocative exploration of the values and character of a time, a place, and a man. It's also a novel that would grace the lists of fine trade publishers, but refreshingly, it comes to us from a university press. Here's hoping that many readers come to know this skillfully wrought tale and that its success encourages TCU Press to bring us more such books." (Booklist) "It's an eye for an eye - obsessive hatred, relentless pursuit and coldblooded revenge for irrevocable loss - in this hypnotic sequel to Smith's highly-praised western, Buffalo Nickel....The plot...moves inexorably to a stunning irony on the final page." ." "Beautifully bitter Depression-era revenge melodrama in which good guys lose, good women die, and virtue's reward is unreasonable tragedy." \u000aSmith returned to more contemporary settings in his subsequent novel, Understanding Women (TCU Press, 1998), a coming-of-age story that takes place in the late 1950s when its sixteen-year-old protagonist and narrator leaves his home in Dallas to spend a summer working for his uncle in the oil fields. The novel won the Jesse H. Jones Award from the Texas Institute of Letters from the Best Novel of 1998 by a Texan or about Texas  and also received an award from the Border Regional Library Association as an \u201cOutstanding Book About the Southwest,\u201d and the book garnered a starred review in Booklist.\u000aGabriel's Eye (Winedale Publishing, 2001) utilizes Smith\u2019s intimate knowledge of contemporary Dallas to focus upon the affair between a female teacher and her student at a local performing arts high school. While the book did secure mild praise from a reviewer in Publisher\u2019s Weekly, it went largely unnoticed in the press, although the Austin Chronicle gave it a full-length, somewhat mixed review. .\u000aSmith once again embarked upon unearthing historical records to produce a lengthy tome based on the riots of 1943 in Beaumont, Texas, when war-time social and living conditions produced racial tension that flared into violent civil disorder when an African-American was falsely accused of raping the wife of an overseas sailor. The book, Purple Hearts (TCU Press, 2008) took seven years to write and went through thirteen drafts to reach its final form. Again, as was the case with his previous novel, the work went unnoticed, though scholar and critic Clay Reynolds has written fully of it. (See below.) The novel was a 2009 finalist for Best Novel award given by the Writers\u2019 League of Texas. HIs short story "Caustic" (Southwest Review, Summer 2010) was given The Kay Catarulla Award for "best short story of 2010" by The Texas Institute of Letters.\u000aSmith\u2019s most recent novel, Steplings, was published in September 2011 by TCU Press. The novel is a coming-of-age story for a young man from a Dallas blue-collar suburb who allows his eleven-year-old stepsister to run away with him, setting off an Amber Alert that divides their newly married parents. Early reviews ran from mixed to very positive: \u201cSlow, a little weak in the plot department, but rich in psychological insight and lit by occasional flashes of humor\u201d; the two characters \u201cmake page-turning strides toward responsibility and maturity as they learn what an awesome task it is to take responsibility for each other";\u201cTexas novelist C.W. Smith has received just about every literary award the state and region bestow, and his latest work, the sprightly and wise Steplings, will no doubt add to his reputation as a Lone Star star\u2026. Steplings comes to a completely realistic, bittersweet conclusion that will disappoint readers who like their endings tied in neat bows. But Smith is no fantasist \u2014 he\u2019s a writer who can be depended on to write life as he actually sees it, not as he (or we) might wish it were\u201d; \u201cEven though these kinds of relationship dynamics have been mined many times before, Smith's story rings true and never feels stale. A dash of international politics spices up the personal politics of Steplings in a way that isn't forced or incongruent. The only misstep is a brief glimpse into the life of Jason's girlfriend that reads like a long parenthetical to the real story \u2013 a story of bonds between siblings and spouses, parents and children, and the fallout when they pull in different directions\u201d.\u000aIn addition to the awards described above, Smith has twice received Creative Writing Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. In April 2011 he was given The Lon Tinkle Award for "sustained excellence in a career" by the Texas Institute of Letters. He belongs to PEN, The Authors Guild, Writer's Guild of America West, and the Texas Institute of Letters.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Works ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Novels ===\u000aThin Men of Haddam.

aVSahibzada Sanwar Azam Sunny (; Bengali: \u09b8\u09be\u09a8\u0993\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u09b0 \u0986\u099c\u09ae \u09b8\u09be\u09a8\u09bf, born 17 December 1989) is a Bangladeshi-born artist, environmental activist and social entrepreneur. He is a columnist for The Daily Star and a blogger. He became fluent in multiple languages and is one of the youngest artists to have a solo exhibition at the National Art Gallery with work in permanent collection at the Liberation War Museum. He finished four years of American high school in eight months with honours and was a college senior by the age of eighteen, teaching university courses in engineering at the age of 21.\u000aA member of the Singranatore family, he is the youngest child and only son of Colonel Muhammad Shahid Sarwar and his wife Kamrun Nahar. One of the founding members of the Sustainable Automotive Energy Infrastructure, he is also the founder of the Sustainable Built Environment Initiative of Bangladesh, later Bangladesh Green Building Council (BGBC), the Bangladesh affiliate of the World Green Building Council.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life and family ==\u000a\u000aHis father was a senior member of the Singranatore family and a military commander of the national Army, United Nations forces and the Border Guards, while his mother, Kamrun Nahar of the Munshibari family of Comilla was an artist and scientist, a student of Iajuddin Ahmed, the thirteenth President of Bangladesh. Both parents were born in erstwhile East Pakistan. He grew up in various places around the country. He has an older sister, named Shahzia Sarwar, an architect.\u000aThe House of Singra and Natore (Singranatore Zamindari) was a formerly ruling family who were hereditary lords (Zamindars) in the northwestern region of Rajshahi in erstwhile East Bengal in the area of present-day Singra, Bangladesh. In 1950, the State Acquisition Act was adopted by the erstwhile democratic Government of East Pakistan, abolishing the rights of the feudal ruling families. The Singranatore family, who served as vassals to the Maharajas of Natore and Dighapatia, also produced many influential members and politicians.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Background and education ===\u000a\u000aIn 2005, as a Youth Ambassador to the United States, he was supported by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the United States Department of State. He started high school at Lincoln College Preparatory Academy after completing eighth grade, to study International Baccalaureate and was a senior aged fifteen. His first ever paid job at the age of 16 was to do a MATLAB programming project for Miftahur Rahman at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at North South University.\u000aA child prodigy, he could fluently read, write or speak six languages by the age of eight and by 2006 he completed the four-year American high school program in less than nine months, as a member of the Honor Roll, United States National Honor Society and winning awards with the Science Olympiad. Then he was offered a Merit Scholarship by the University of Kansas School of Engineering when he was only sixteen years old. He was a final year university student (college senior) studying engineering by the age of eighteen. At Kansas, he was an active brother of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity (PIKE) initiated through the Beta Gamma Chapter.\u000aHe also holds a Master of Public Administration degree from the Henry W. Bloch School of Management at the University of Missouri-Kansas City where he was a graduate researcher under Jered Carr at the L.P. Cookingham Institute of Urban Affairs. He graduated with Pi Alpha Alpha, Omicron Delta Kappa and Phi Kappa Phi honours in 2013. Nicholas Peroff was his graduate advisor.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Activities ==\u000aHis family was involved in the energy and infrastructure sectors for decades, particularly oil. His paternal uncle M. M. Rahmat Ullah, an East Pakistani bureaucrat from the 1960s and politician who unsuccessfully contested the seat of Natore's third constituency as a member of parliament to the National Assembly in the Eighth National Parliamentary Elections of 2001, was also the Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department and later the chairman of the Capital Development Authority of the Government of Bangladesh under General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, the military dictator and later President of Bangladesh. The President and him were however charged in the Janata Tower Case in the early 1990s by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. Another paternal uncle, Akther Hussain of Natore, an East Pakistan regional officer of Pakistan State Oil was made one of the six executives of the Jamuna Oil Company, Bangladesh's National oil company under Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation by the Government of Bangladesh.\u000aA maternal uncle, Major Raihanul Abedin was the PSC Director of the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation. Working on behalf of the Government of Bangladesh, he oversaw all energy production treaties with various foreign energy companies, including Enron Corporation, Niko Resources, and Tullow Oil. Later, during the military-supported government of Bangladesh in 2007 he was appointed the managing director of Water Supply and Sewerage System. He was forced to resign on charges of nepotism once the ruling party took power in the 2009 national elections when the newly formed government sued top officials of the old regime. The Major was credited with being the first to introduce cooking gas instead of harmful fuels for automotive fuel, to decrease carbon emission in early 2001 under Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Clean transportation ===\u000a\u000aIn 2008, he cofounded the KU Ecohawks during the Automotive industry crisis of 2008\u20132010 in the United States. The group recycles old vehicles to run on community wastes and renewables, especially on the University of Kansas campus (and adjoining localities) and not rely on conventional fossil fuel sources that pollute the local and global environment. The Ecohawks was one of the largest and most promising initiatives of the University of Kansas and was funded and sponsored by Aptera Motors, The Coca-Cola Company, Daimler Trucks North America, Grundfos, Yokohama Rubber Company and Black & Veatch among others, at various stages. A college senior at age eighteen, he also worked to computationally quantify and minimise vehicle rolling friction and aerodynamic drag. They built a solar energy filling station on campus consisting of six 180W panels that allowed recharging the car batteries in half a day while it is parked. Cars typically reached 40 mph around campus while the fuel economy was increased to 80 mpge due to solar refilling. Although the recycled car ran, initially media reports called the car to get 500 mpg, which it did not. The ecohawks also proposed a plan to take the vehicles completely off grid. They installed six monocrystalline solar cells on their workspace and charged the cars from it, with no energy taken from the grid.\u000aTheir efficiency over performance initiatives, coincided with the Automotive crisis where in 2009, in an exhibition opening, he told the University Daily Kansan that the point of the initiative is trying to get people to think about how 'inefficient' the auto industry is. Later, Ford Motor Company President and CEO Alan Mulally visited the School of Engineering and talked with the students regarding the auto industry and answered questions about the technological, financial, cultural and political realities facing Ford after being bailed out by the US Congress alongside others of the "Big Three". The Ecohawks planned to recycle older cars to run on greener technologies thereby eliminating the energy needed for production; the recycle of the vehicle itself prevented the release of a few tons of carbon to the atmosphere. The team researched advanced technologies in the small scale including NiMH, LiCoO2, LiFePO4 batteries. The group used scaled down RC Cars for testing and validation. Research also conceptualised a parallel hybrid design that used a small internal combustion engine running on the a planned biodiesel blend and a brushless electric motor allowing for the doubling of torque. Research with ECM, hydrogen fuel cells and Metal hydride storage tanks, funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) grant that led to the group design an infrastructure with Smart grid technologies to be showcased in Washington, DC and converted more vehicle. The groups designs were adopted by the university when the KU Libraries started using vehicles that were converted by the ecohawks. The KU Libraries mail vehicle travelled about 22 miles on average on a given day. The electric vehicle travels 80 to 90 miles before a recharge. The library car was a Chevrolet K5 Blazer, while the neighbourhood EV was a 1974 Volkswagen Beetle.\u000aIn February 2011, city officials of Douglas County in Lawrence, KS, declared that the University would be getting an electric car charging station, although the group made the first unofficial charging station in May 2010. In an article by Wired magazine it was estimated that profits, both financial and societal was possible if the ecohawks project was replicated on a larger scale.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Green buildings ===\u000a\u000aSunny founded the Sustainable Built Environment Initiative \u2013 Bangladesh (later Bangladesh Green Building Council) and since 2008 been bringing together national architects, scientists, environmentalists and government officials to transform the building industry in Bangladesh into a more sustainable and efficient system. With growing population in a diminishing land and rapid urbanisation to major cities, 'Going green' had become a marketing ploy for various organisations as there were no quantifiable way to judge a structures sustainability. He offered a centralised board to offer Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications to interested projects and firms and then to propose a similar voluntary building rating tool that is much cheaper to attain and one that is much suited to the socio-economic conditions of the country and relevant to its building environment and construction culture. About the feasibility of widespread utilisation of LEED certifications, it was further said that it is very expensive and the Bangladesh is in the process of developing a green building rating system in the regional context. He elaborated:\u000a\u000aI wanted to make a more country-specific rating system. It needed to be more specific to the climate and environment in the country and would help the country's own economy...certain window angles on houses would help heat homes in the U.S., but that would be wasteful in places where they don't need the sun's energy to heat homes.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, he opined that the garments industry has been a critical early-adopter of green buildings, with certifications playing a critical role:\u000a\u000a...tragic events in building collapses in this area, has channeled global attention to this even further. This has affected trade and investor relations greatly, and certification is one way to assuage the concerns.\u000a\u000aEducational programs in sustainable designs and various universities in Bangladesh started to promote Green Building principles in their curriculum, such as in the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, American International University-Bangladesh, North South University, BRAC University and Asia Pacific University. Due to conserving water and energy,the rating tool would achieve the six-point goals of the National Water Policy of 1999 by the World Bank as well as the Renewable Energy Policy of 2008 by the Ministry of Power and Energy. National and international energy companies like Energypac and Siemens attended the event to assess the roles of the corporate stakeholders while United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fellows commented on the global imperative of such an initiative. The first proposed rating tool aimed to fulfill the Seventh Target from the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Initially with minimal government support, the plan was to transform the market with cost effective steps. In another interview with The Independent, it was pointed out that the cost effectiveness of the green buildings are not correctly understood, and that increased productivity and energy savings of a green building outweighs initial costs. In the Dhaka Tribune, he reiterated that "the problem is that there is a great misconception regarding the cost effectiveness of the green design and construction" and that the energy savings far outweigh the initial costs when green building projects are correctly done. In an interview with Southeast Asia Building magazine, he said:\u000a\u000aInstead of going for innovative technologies...they [real estate companies] bypass these measures as these would be added costs and extra space, space that they could rather sell in this high demand market.\u000a\u000aThese activities were also promoted by national and region experts, such as Mustapha Khalid Palash, the 2010 Holcim Green Built Sustainable Design Competition winner was the Chairman of the Practicing Professionals Committee, and Rafiq Azam, defined BGBC platform as a way for Bangladesh to define 'Green' according to the national circumstances. The Institute of Architects Bangladesh, which works with different government organisation to offer education and government advocacy commented on the adaptability of sustainable principles in the national architecture community in the form of the BGBC rating tool. At the same meeting, the Additional Chief Architect of the Ministry of Housing and Public Works, Bangladesh spoke about the government's role. BGBC also briefly collabored with Washington D.C. based Development Alternatives Inc to work with World Bank to conduct the first ever national study to identify the scope for developing Green Building Codes and to benchmark the GHG emission standards on Green Buildings and Climate Change in Bangladesh.\u000aIn 2012, he was a Brower Youth Award semi-finalist. In 2013, he won the SBN Youth Award (Australia) by patrons Peter Ellyard and Jane Goodall.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Sustainable infrastructure ===\u000a\u000aTo provide jobs for fresh graduates and help the dwindling power sector of the country reduce systematic power outage, he proposed that Bangladesh integrate RETs into the national electric grid to supplement any generation and to maintain a storage system, so that the country may move towards a more stable supply of electricity to the masses and 'attempt' reach the global Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations, specifically on Environmental sustainability as well as Bangladesh's National Renewable Energy Policy's goal of meeting 5% of the national demand with renewable energy sources by 2015 and 10% by 2020. With lack of implementation, he said it would be nearly impossible on the current time frame. Private power could be integrated to the grid and demand response capabilities would mean that Feed-in tariff would be possible for parties who generate power on site and even for energy-efficient home owners. This would expedite investments in sustainable sources of energy. He commented:\u000a\u000aRadio transmitters operating remotely in unlicensed radio bands using two way real time communication to transmit coded instructions from the central to the circuit breakers in selected coordinates of the micro grids substations to maintain multiple power flow lines with automated control and digital metering.\u000a\u000aHe urged to lower the system losses and rectify illegal links, and provide more jobs to the large Electrical and Telecommunications Engineering graduate base in Dhaka while transmitters and meters themselves could be made by local populace. During that time, aged only 21, he taught college courses in the fields of electrical engineering and computer science at North South University. Speaking to representatives from Siemens about smart grid and meter utilisations in Bangladesh, he also involved national renewable energy technology providers and private power generation companies in the upgrade and integration plans.\u000aAlthough think tanks such as Bangladesh Solar Energy Society and Renewable Energy Institute (REI), along with the German Federal Government International Development Government Agency Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) supported his scheme, the Secretary of the Ministry of Power, Government of Bangladesh has said that the government has no plans to upgrade to a smart grid.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Works ==\u000aAs a prodigious artist, he started detailed drawing and painting at the age of seven. His family was patrons of the art, and had a sizeable art collection at his residence growing up.\u000aHis mother, Kamrun Nahar, the younger sister of American artist Saleh Uddin was a realism artist of some repute who worked with oil, would frequent the studio of her teacher and prominent artist Syful Islam with him when he was around ten. He eventually became one of the youngest artists to have a solo exhibition at the National Art Gallery with work in permanent collection at the Liberation War Museum.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of child prodigies\u000aList of military brats\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aSunny Sanwar on IMDb\u000aSunny Sanwar in libraries (WorldCat catalog)\u000aSmart City - Case Study, by Sunny, Sanwar A. at Harvard Business Review\u000aSunny, Sanwar Biography at Amazon\u000aSunny, Sanwar (2011) Green Buildings, Clean Transport and the Low Carbon Economy (ISBN 9783846593332) at Google Books\u000a\u000aSanwar Azam Sunny at Google Scholar\u000aSanwar Azam Sunny profile at ancestry.com\u000a15 Smartest kids to ever exist at eBaum's World (July 2015)\u000aEnvironmental Uncertainty and Climate Change How about the "whether"? 2013 article with Jimmy Adegoke in Daily Star

aVTerence William Evans (born 12 April 1965) is an English former professional footballer who played as a central defender and made over 530 career appearances. He spent the majority of his career in the Football League with Brentford and Wycombe Wanderers and captained both clubs. He is a member of the Brentford Hall of Fame. After his retirement from football, Evans served as caretaker manager, assistant manager and physiotherapist at Wycombe. He is currently on the medical team at rugby union club Wasps.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Early years ===\u000aBorn in Hammersmith, Evans began his career with Southern League Southern Division side Hillingdon, a period bisected by a spell on non-contract terms with Queens Park Rangers. He made his debut for Hillingdon at age 16.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Brentford ===\u000aEvans moved into the Football League in the summer of 1985, when he joined Division Three side Brentford for a £5,000 fee. Evans had an uneven beginning to his career at Griffin Park, suffering an injury in a friendly match in February 1986 and making two aborted comebacks, before returning to the side on a regular basis in October 1987 and making 32 appearances during the 1987\u201388 season. He forged a centre back partnership with Keith Millen and eventually became captain of the club. Evans made a career-high 62 appearances during the 1988\u201389 season, a successful campaign in which he missed just one league game and appeared in all 8 matches of Brentford's run to the sixth round of the FA Cup. He was voted the club's Supporters' and Players' Player of the Year for the 1988\u201389 season and also won both accolades for 1989\u201390.\u000aEvans' greatest season with Brentford came in 1991\u201392, when he captained the side to the Division Three title and promotion to the second tier for the first time since 1954. He was also named in the PFA Team of the Year. Evans had a season to forget in the new Division One, succumbing to injury on the opening day against Wolverhampton Wanderers and only regaining fitness for the final 10 games of the season, ending the campaign with relegation straight back to the third tier. Early in the 1993\u201394 season, new manager David Webb preferred Jamie Bates and Shane Westley to Evans and Millen as his centre back pairing and Evans chose to depart the club. He made 285 appearances and scored 30 goals during his eight years at Griffin Park. A cult hero, Evans was named as Brentford's all-time fans' favourite, second greatest player and best-ever captain in a Football League 125th anniversary poll in 2013 and he also topped a BBC Sport Brentford fans' cult hero poll in 2005. He was inducted into the Brentford Hall of Fame in August 2014.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Wycombe Wanderers (loan and permanent transfer) ===\u000aEvans joined Division Three side Wycombe Wanderers in August 1993 on a six-week loan and linked up with friend and former Brentford teammate Jason Cousins. He had a difficult debut in a 4\u20133 victory away to Hereford United on 31 August 1993 and after regaining fitness, his performances led manager Martin O'Neil to sign him on a permanent deal for £40,000. An injury suffered in a Football League Trophy Southern Area semi-final shootout win over Fulham on 8 February 1994 ruled Evans out for the remainder of the 1993\u201394 season, though his form prior to the injury was such that he was named in the PFA Team of the Year. After Wycombe's promotion to Division Two via the playoffs, Evans returned as captain for the 1994\u201395 season. He missed just two league games as the Chairboys finished in sixth position, missing out on a second successive playoff campaign. Evans played on until the end of the 1996\u201397 season, when he was released by manager John Gregory. Evans made 157 appearances and scored 19 goals during his four seasons at Adams Park.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Kingstonian ===\u000aEvans dropped into non-League football in the summer of 1997 and linked up with former Wycombe teammates Matt Crossley and Gary Patterson at Isthmian League Premier Division side Kingstonian. His single season at Kingsmeadow was a successful one, making 51 appearances, scoring three goals and captaining the side to promotion to the Conference as champions.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Physiotherapy career ==\u000aEvans returned to Wycombe in 1998 as the youth team's physiotherapist. Evans stated that his desire to become a physiotherapist was driven by Wycombe's Sports Therapist Dave Jones, who oversaw Evans' management of problems with his right knee, having suffered from a chondral defect and undergone two anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions and a medial cruciate ligament repair during the last three years of his playing career. Evans departed Wycombe in March 2004, but returned in 2006 to take up the role of Senior Strength & Conditioning coach. He left to take up a similar role at rugby union side Wasps in 2008, progressing to become the club's Senior Strength & Conditioning Rehabilitation Specialist and serving as a physiotherapist. He later took a similar role at Ealing Trailfinders.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Management and coaching career ==\u000aWhile working as Wycombe's youth team physiotherapist, the sacking of first team manager Neil Smillie on 11 January 1999 saw Evans take over the position as caretaker. With morale rock-bottom, Evans took temporary charge for two difficult games against Millwall and Chesterfield that both ended in defeat. He was, however, retained as part of the management team as a coach when Lawrie Sanchez was appointed manager on 5 February.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aEvans played rugby union as a schoolboy and remarked in 2010 that he may have entered the game had it been professional in England at the time. Evans' son Harry is a taekwondo fighter and won gold medals in the U16 categories in the 2014 ITF World Championship and the 2015 ITF European Championship. Evans worked as a printer while with Hillingdon early in his playing career and after retirement from football, he worked as a personal trainer and ran a gym.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Honours ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== As a player ===\u000aBrentford\u000aFootball League Division Three: 1991\u201392\u000aWycombe Wanderers\u000aFootball League Division Three playoffs: 1993\u201394\u000aKingstonian\u000aIsthmian League Premier Division: 1997\u201398\u000a\u000a\u000a=== As an individual ===\u000aBrentford Supporters' Player of the Year: 1988\u201389, 1989\u201390\u000aBrentford Players' Player of the Year: 1988\u201389, 1989\u201390\u000aBrentford Hall of Fame\u000aFootball League Division Three PFA Team of the Year: 1991\u201392 (third tier)\u000aFootball League Division Three PFA Team of the Year: 1993\u201394 (fourth tier)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career statistics ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aTerry Evans at Soccerbase \u000aTerry Evans management career statistics at Soccerbase\u000aTerry Evans at ealingtrailfinders1stxv.com

aVThe Bailey Island Bridge (also called the Cribstone Bridge) is a historic bridge in the town of Harpswell within Cumberland County in the state of Maine.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aFor many years, the residents of Bailey Island, Maine, advocated that a bridge be built to connect their island with Orr's Island. The town of Harpswell, Maine, which encompasses both islands, turned down the request. However, when the Maine Legislature drafted a law allowing the state and counties to fund bridge construction, a plan emerged to build such a bridge. A contract was signed in 1926, with construction beginning on the Bailey Island Bridge in 1927 and finishing in 1928. The engineer for the project was Llewelyn N. Edwards, bridge engineer for the Maine State Highway Commission.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Design ==\u000a\u000aDesign of the 1,150-foot bridge was complicated by the tides in the area known as Will's Gut. It was decided to build a cobwork bridge, using granite slabs as cribstones, acquired from local quarries in nearby Yarmouth, Maine. The slabs, longer than they are wide, are laid horizontally, first lengthwise, and then crosswise, in several layers. No mortar or cement is used. Granite slabs were considered sufficiently heavy to withstand wind and wave, while the open cribbing allowed the tide to ebb and flow freely without increasing tidal current to any great degree.\u000aSome 10,000 tons of granite were used in the project. A concrete road (now part of Route 24) was built on top of the cribstones.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Additions and Recognition ==\u000aA sidewalk was added in 1951 and guard rails in 1961. The Bailey Island Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975; on July 19, 1984, it was recognized as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The Bailey Island Bridge is reported to be the only granite cribstone bridge in the world.\u000aIn 2009 and 2010, the bridge underwent reconstruction to repair cracked or sheared stones. During the repairs, a 1,000-foot temporary bridge was placed alongside the cribstone bridge so that traffic could continue without disruption. On November 20, 2010, a ribbon-cutting ceremony and parade took place to celebrate the reopening of the bridge. The restored bridge maintains the dimensions of the original, and the replacement stones were obtained from the same quarry in Yarmouth that supplied the original.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Photo gallery ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aNational Register of Historic Places listings in Cumberland County, Maine\u000aList of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sources ==\u000aBridgemeister\u000aBailey Island Bridge at Structurae\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aMaine Bridge History\u000aHistory of Bailey Island\u000aKathleen Clemons Photography of Bailey Island Bridge\u000aDocumentary video: The Cribstone Bridge, Explore Maine segment,(c)2007, Remember ME!

aVMatthew Mullineux MC (8 August 1867 \u2013 13 February 1945) was an English rugby union scrum-half who, although not capped for England, was selected for two British Lions tours. He gained one cap during the 1896 tour to South Africa and captained the 1899 tour of Australia. An Anglican minister, he later became a chaplain in the British Army, and was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during the First World War.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aMullineux was born in Barton-upon-Irwell, Eccles, Lancashire, though some sources record his birthplace as nearby Worsley, to Matthew Mullineux, an insurance-inspector, and his wife Elizabeth Derbyshire. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School and then Matriculated to St John's College, Cambridge. He received his BA in 1896, and the next year was ordained as a Deacon at Southwark Cathedral. The next year he was ordained as a priest and took his orders at the Church of Mottingham, also becoming the Assistant Master at the nearby Royal Naval School in Eltham. On 9 May 1899 he left England for Australia as part of the British Isles rugby tour and left both his posts.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Rugby career ==\u000aMullineux first came to note as a rugby player when he represented Cambridge University as a student, playing at scrum-half, before turning out for Blackheath. In 1896 he was selected to play in Johnny Hammond's British Isles team to tour South Africa; although Mullineux only played in one of the Test matches, the opening win over South Africa at Port Elizabeth. He played in twelve games in total on the tour scoring four tries, including two against Queenstown, and a dropped goal in the win over Grahamstown.\u000aIn 1899, the first official British team to tour Australia was selected, and Mullineux was not only chosen to captain the team, but also to manage it. Mullineux again represented the British team in the opening game, but the tourists lacked cohesion and lost to the Australians 13-3. The British Isles had under-performed in the few invitational games leading up to the first Test, and after the defeat to the Wallabies, Mullineux dropped himself from the team for the remaining Tests, and brought in Charlie Adamson as his replacement. The captaincy was given to Frank Stout, and the tourists play began to improve. After Mullineux's decision the British Isles played far better rugby and won the last three tests to take the series 3\u20131. Although no longer a part of the Test team, Mullineux continued to represent the British team against the invitational and regional teams. He played in ten games on the tour, his only points came from a try in the loss against Queensland.\u000aA reflection of Mullineux's character was seen during the 1899 tour, when after the third Test in Sydney he undiplomatically embarrassed the Australian hosts at the after-match dinner. After JJ Calvert, the president of the New South Wales RFU, had made a light-hearted excuse for the Australian team's poor performance, Mullineux responded by lecturing the Australian's on their style of play, and offered suggestions as to how they could refine their play.\u000aDespite only playing in the first Test, Mullineux was honoured when bush poet, Banjo Paterson wrote a poem about his playing prowess, entitled The Reverend Mullineux.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Military career ==\u000aMullineux followed a career in the Anglican church from an early age, and was the Reverend Mr Mullineux during the British Isles tours; even preaching at local churches after the matches. After the British Isles tour, he served in the British Army as an acting Chaplain to the Forces during the Second Boer War. On 7 August 1902 he became a Royal Navy chaplain, and served on several ships; the HMS Amphion (1902\u201304), HMS Terrible (1904), HMS Albion (1904\u201306), HMS Barfleur (1905\u201306) and HMS Hogue (1906\u201307). In 1907 he became the Assistant Chaplain at Montreux.\u000aBefore the outbreak of the First World War, Mullineux was chaplain to the Flying Angel Mission in America, but travelled by mail boat to New Zealand in order to proceed on active duty. While in New Zealand he studied medicine, before leaving for Britain as a Chaplain to the Forces. In May 1918, while posted at a regimental aid post in France, Mullineux took command of the post after the serving medical officer was incapacitated by his wounds. The station came under high-explosive and gas-shelling for 12 hours, during which time Mullineux tended to the wounded and supervised evacuation of the site. For his actions during this time, he was awarded the Military Cross.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Later life ==\u000aAfter the war, Mullineux continued his connections with the armed forces and Australasia, when he toured churches and Red Cross Societies throughout Australia, giving public lectures on the war cemeteries of Europe. In 1919 Mullineux set up the St Barnabas Society, a charity which helped finance those too poor to visit the graves of family members who had died in the First World War. The society also placed wreaths at graves on behalf of relatives, and soon became the most important organisation providing subsidised war grave pilgrimages from Britain. After his military service came to an end, Mullineux became the vicar of Marham in Norfolk, a post he held from 1935 until his death in 1945.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a1899 British Lions tour to Australia\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==

aVJames Brownlie (15 May 1885 \u2013 29 December 1973) was a Scottish international footballer and manager, who played as a goalkeeper.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aJimmy Brownlie was born in Blantyre and was an outstanding personality in Scottish football over many years, as a goalkeeper and manager. Almost his entire professional playing career, lasting from 1906 to 1923, was spent with Third Lanark, and as well as playing in 16 of the last 17 internationals before the First World War, he also appeared no less than 14 times for the Scottish League XI, and in four Victory Internationals once the conflict was over.\u000aIn May 1923, Brownlie was appointed player/manager of Dundee Hibernian, who were renamed Dundee United later that year. He continued to play for a further season, but later made one further appearance in an emergency, at the age of 40 in 1926. His first managerial spell with the club found early success, with the Division Two title in 1925, and again in 1929, but he left the club in April 1931 on the brink of a third promotion. He returned in 1934 with the club at a low ebb, one away from bottom of Division Two, and helped to effect a partial revival before he left again in October 1936. A third and final spell came in season 1938\u201339, in a dual role with Sam Irving; both men were also appointed as directors of the club at this time. In May 1939, Brownlie announced that he was giving up both roles due to the pressure of his other business interests.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Honours ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Dundee United ===\u000aAs manager:\u000aScottish League Division Two: 2\u000a\u000a1924\u201325, 1928\u201329\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial Dundee United FC profile\u000aLondon Hearts profile

aVJackie McNamara (born 24 October 1973) is a Scottish former professional footballer who is the chief executive of National League club York City. He is a former Scotland international, who filled a variety of defensive roles in his playing career.\u000aMcNamara began his playing career with Dunfermline Athletic before joining Celtic in 1995. During ten years at the club he won the Scottish Premier League title four times and the Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup three times each. He then played in England with Wolverhampton Wanderers before returning to Scotland, finishing his career with spells at Aberdeen, Falkirk and Partick Thistle.\u000aIn international football, McNamara played for Scotland at under-21 and B international levels, and made 33 full international appearances. He was a member of the Scotland squad that played at the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\u000aMcNamara moved into management with Partick Thistle in April 2011, before his appointment at Dundee United in January 2013. He was sacked by Dundee United in September 2015, and two months later took over as manager of York City.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aMcNamara was born in Glasgow and is the son of Jackie McNamara Sr., a former professional footballer. He played youth football for Cumbernauld Colts and Falkirk-based Gairdoch United.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Playing career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Club ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Dunfermline Athletic ====\u000aMcNamara joined Dunfermline Athletic from Gairdoch United on 17 September 1991.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Celtic ====\u000aMcNamara moved to Celtic for a £600,000 fee on 3 October 1995. He made an impressive start to his Celtic career, being named PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year in 1996. McNamara won his first trophy with the club in the 1997\u201398 season when Celtic won the Scottish Premier Division, preventing arch-rivals Rangers from winning ten-in-a-row, which would have seen them eclipse Celtic's record of nine-in-a-row. He was recognised for his performances this season by his fellow players when being named the PFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year in 1998. He featured regularly in the Celtic first eleven until the arrival of Martin O'Neill in the 2000\u201301 season saw him become more of a fringe player, although he did score the opening goal in the 2001 Scottish Cup Final, a 3\u20131 win over Hibernian at Hampden Park. He was suspended for their 3\u20130 victory over Kilmarnock at Hampden Park in the 2001 Scottish League Cup Final.\u000aMcNamara re-established himself in the team in 2003\u201304 and was awarded the SFWA Footballer of the Year in 2004, beating off competition from his teammates Henrik Larsson and Chris Sutton. The following year McNamara was named captain when Paul Lambert was injured. McNamara proved himself a consistent and reliable performer on the field, playing almost every game in the league in the 2004\u201305 season. To reward his loyalty to the club over a ten-year period, Celtic played a testimonial match against the Republic of Ireland. The match ended 1\u20130 a win for the Republic of Ireland. At the end of the 2004\u201305 season Martin O'Neill left as manager and Celtic brought in Gordon Strachan as his replacement.\u000aMcNamara's contract was also due to expire at the end of the 2004\u201305 season. Strachan assured McNamara that he wanted him at the club but Celtic were slow to offer a new contract, waiting until the close season to do so. By that time McNamara had already accepted an offer from Wolverhampton Wanderers as he had assumed Celtic no longer wanted his services. As he went on record saying he still wanted to play for the club, he was told he was still needed by the club by its manager, and he was offered the contract he wanted while still in a position to accept it, the incident has caused much speculation amongst supporters and the media as to who was to blame for his departure from Celtic. The club accused McNamara of being unreasonable and of moving for monetary reasons. They also blamed his agent for not encouraging negotiations and setting unhelpful deadlines.\u000aMcNamara had gone on record as saying he wanted to end his career with Celtic and seemed to be bemused when no new contract was forthcoming. After he had accepted the Wolves offer, McNamara felt that Celtic showed a lack of respect to him in their comments to the media and he accused them of harming his reputation for their own benefit. It also emerged that in his new contract at Wolves, he was earning the same wages as his previous contract with Celtic.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Wolverhampton Wanderers ====\u000aHowever McNamara had agreed with then manager Glenn Hoddle that he would join Wolverhampton Wanderers in the summer of 2005 on a free transfer under the Bosman ruling. After a promising start to his Wolves career, McNamara sustained a cruciate knee ligament injury in the home match with Leicester City in September 2005. He came back in the penultimate game of the 2005\u201306 season at home to Brighton & Hove Albion.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Aberdeen ====\u000aMcNamara joined Aberdeen from Wolves on a two-year contract in May 2007, but he left Pittodrie before the end of the season, with manager Jimmy Calderwood citing "travelling and injuries" as the reasons for his departure. Three weeks later, it was revealed that McNamara would join Falkirk for the 2008\u201309 season.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Falkirk ====\u000aMcNamara signed a two-year contract at Falkirk in May 2008.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Partick Thistle ====\u000aMcNamara signed a one-month loan deal with Partick Thistle in February 2010, making him available to debut the following day against Dundee if selected. The terms of the deal allowed it to be extended beyond its initial period, but McNamara suffered a leg break during a match against Ayr United, prematurely ending his 2009\u201310 season. McNamara subsequently signed a one-year contract with Thistle for the 2010\u201311 season, which then continued on a one-year rolling contract basis.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== International ===\u000aMcNamara made his debut for the Scotland national under-21 team in a 2\u20131 away win over Greece on 13 December 1994, in a 1996 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifier. His first goal came in the reverse fixture, a 3\u20130 home win on 15 August 1995. McNamara finished his under-21 career with 12 caps and one goal, earned between 1994 and 1996. He was capped once by the B team, in a 3\u20130 away defeat to Denmark on 23 April 1996, before making his debut for the senior team in a 2\u20130 away win over Latvia in a 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier on 5 October 1996. He was selected for the Scotland squad in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He did not feature in the opening match, a 2\u20131 defeat against defending champions Brazil in Paris. His introduction from the bench in Scotland's second match, against Norway in Bordeaux, was seen as pivotal in wiping out a one-goal deficit. The game finished in a 1\u20131 draw, leaving Scotland with a chance of qualification to the knockout stages. Ultimately the efforts were futile as Morocco were victorious in St Etienne with a 3\u20130 win in the final match and Norway managed to qualify from the group with a win against Brazil. McNamara earned 33 caps for Scotland between 1996 and 2005.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Management career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Partick Thistle ===\u000aMcNamara began his managerial career at Partick Thistle where he was appointed caretaker manager on 15 April 2011, after Ian McCall left his job. He was then appointed manager on a one-year rolling contract a month later. Thistle performed well in his second season as manager, reaching the 2012\u201313 Scottish Challenge Cup final and lying in second place in the 2012\u201313 Scottish First Division in late January 2013. At this point he left Thistle to take the vacant position at SPL club Dundee United. McNamara was replaced at Partick Thistle by Alan Archibald, a former Thistle and Dundee United defender.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Dundee United ===\u000aMcNamara's first match in charge of his new club was a fifth round Scottish Cup tie with Third Division Rangers on 2 February 2013. United won 3\u20130, with Johnny Russell putting the home side ahead in the first minute of the match. The following week United defeated Hearts 3\u20131 in McNamara's first Scottish Premier League match as manager of the side. It was the side's first league win at home since August 2012. On 24 February 2014, McNamara extended his contract with Dundee United until 2017.\u000aMcNamara's first full season at Tannadice saw United reach the Scottish Cup final, which his side lost 2\u20130 to St Johnstone. The following season United lost the League Cup final to Celtic, 2\u20130. The latter few months of that season also saw a sharp dip in United's form following the sale in January 2015 of Gary Mackay-Steven and Stuart Armstrong.\u000aReports following Dundee United's 2\u20131 defeat to St Johnstone on 26 September 2015 suggested McNamara had been relieved of his duties, which was confirmed by the club two days later.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== York City ===\u000a\u000aMcNamara was appointed manager of League Two club York City on 4 November 2015, and his first match in charge came three days later, with a 3\u20132 away defeat to Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup first round. In April 2016, York's relegation from the Football League was confirmed by a 3\u20130 defeat against Accrington. In October 2016, a 6\u20131 defeat against the division's bottom club, Guiseley, left York in 20th place in the National League. Following talks between McNamara and the club, York announced the manager would resign if they failed to gain a "positive result" in their next match, against Braintree Town. Following a 1\u20131 draw in that match, McNamara announced he would be stepping down, but had agreed to stay on as manager until a replacement was found. When Gary Mills was reappointed manager on 16 October 2016, McNamara took on the role of chief executive at the club.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aMcNamara co-wrote a television sitcom pilot with Scottish actor and comedy writer Fran Gilhooley called The Therapy Room, starring Jackie's actor brother, Donny. The show is based around a young footballer who is catapulted from amateur football to the English top flight, and is partly based around McNamara's own experiences as a player and manager.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career statistics ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Club ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== International ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Managerial statistics ==\u000aAs of 16 October 2016\u000a\u000a\u000a== Honours ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== As a player ===\u000aCeltic\u000aScottish Premier Division: 1997\u201398\u000aScottish Premier League: 2000\u201301, 2001\u201302, 2003\u201304\u000aScottish Cup: 2000\u201301, 2003\u201304, 2004\u201305\u000aScottish League Cup: 1997\u201398, 1999\u20132000, 2000\u201301\u000aIndividual\u000aPFA Scotland Young Player of the Year: 1996\u000aPFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year: 1998\u000aSFWA Footballer of the Year: 2004\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aJackie McNamara at Soccerbase

aVLura Gibbons Currier (née Gibbons, 1912-1983) was an American librarian who worked as the director of the Mississippi Library Commission. In her time there, she greatly expanded Mississippi's library system and oversaw the early stages of the library system's desegregation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life and career ==\u000aGibbons was born as Lura Gibbons in Erie, Kansas to road-builder Vaughn Gibbons and his wife, Frances. Her father's career caused her family to move around the United States frequently. She received two Bachelor's degrees, one in English from Mississippi Southern College in 1937, and another in Library Science from Texas Women's University in 1940. She also began her library work in 1940, working at several libraries in Texas. In 1945, Gibbons married Alfred R. Currier, a member of the United States Navy and moved to Washington with him. Although the marriage quickly dissolved, she continued to use her married name throughout her career. In Washington, she worked in library public relations, receiving the John Cotton Dana Award for her work in 1948. In 1950, she left Washington for Mississippi, where she began her work with the Mississippi Library Commission.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Work with the Mississippi Library Commission ==\u000aCurrier began her career with the Mississippi Library Commission as a field representative, but was the commission's director by the time she resigned. Throughout her time there, she was heavily involved with the creation of new libraries. As director, she oversaw the opening libraries in 70 towns that previously lacked them, the total renovation of libraries in 38 more, and a vast expansion of bookmobile service. These projects were facilitated by her previously developed public relations skills, which helped her obtain the necessary funding.\u000aDuring Currier's time with the Mississippi Library Commission, the Civil Rights Movement was gaining momentum. However, Currier's efforts to provide library services to African-American communities were more focused on opening new segregated libraries, rather than desegregating existing libraries. During this era, the American Library Association (ALA) took a stronger stance against segregation, forbidding library professionals who belonged to segregated library associations from attending national meetings as members of those associations. As director of the Mississippi Library Commission, Currier opposed this policy, claiming that it would delay desegregation in Southern libraries, and chose to sever ties with the ALA rather than push for the commission and its libraries to desegregate. Although she privately disapproved of segregation, she made little to no attempt to disrupt the status quo until Mississippi's libraries were ordered to desegregate, when she advised librarians under her supervision to comply with the order. Currier left the Mississippi Library Commission in 1967, 70% of Mississippi's public libraries complied with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, indicating that although she made progress, she did not successfully complete the desegregation of her organization's domain.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Later life and death ==\u000aAfter leaving the Mississippi Library Commission, Currier moved back to Washington, where she worked as a library development specialist for Washington State University. Currier's last official position was as the director of the Pacific Northwest Bibliographic Center. She retired from this position in 1977 and returned to Mississippi, where she worked in librarianship in an unofficial capacity for the rest of her life. At the time of her death in 1983, Currier was serving on the Pascagoula City Library Board. Her papers were donated to the University of Southern Mississippi in 1986.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

After the death of his father in 1896, he grew up in an orphanage and began a qualification in retail business. By the chance acquaintance of Hans Oberländer, a stage director at Berlin, he started to take stage classes and was first engaged at the municipal Theater of Freiberg, Saxony. In 1908 Liedtke worked at the New German Theatre in New York City and in 1909 at the Deutsches Theater Berlin.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aIn 1912 Liedtke appeared for the first time in the silent movie Zu spät and from now on usually as a young "Charming Boy" and gentleman.

aVPrester John is a 1910 adventure novel by John Buchan. It tells the story of a young Scotsman named David Crawfurd and his adventures in South Africa, where a Zulu uprising is tied to the medieval legend of Prester John. Crawfurd is similar in many ways to Buchan's later character, Richard Hannay.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000aThe setting is contemporaneous with publication: the beginning of the twentieth century. Crawfurd grows up in Kirkcaple, by the North Sea, where he first encounters the antagonist, Laputa, performing a ritual on the beach. Crawfurd's father dies, and he goes to work as a shopkeeper in a place called Blaauwildebeestefontein.\u000aCrawfurd comes into contact with a Portuguese man, Henriques, and again with Laputa, and he gradually learns of illegal diamond smuggling and of a planned rising of the native people of the region, including the Zulu people and the Swazi people, led by Laputa. Laputa's skill as a preacher allows him to inspire many tribes across the region to follow him, and he invokes the legend of Prester John and positions himself as the rightful heir and leader who can rise up against colonial rule. Crawfurd learns more about this after meeting Captain Arcoll, who leads the colonial army and police.\u000aUsing information learnt from having overheard the conversation of Laputa and Henriques, Crawfurd infiltrates the cave where the tribal leaders are gathering and witnesses Laputa commencing the rising, wearing the necklet of Prester John, which legitimises his leadership. Crawfurd is captured, but having managed to relay a message to Captain Arcoll, escapes during an ambush and steals the necklet from the hands of Henriques, who is trying to steal it for himself. After running all night, Crawfurd is climbing a ravine in the escarpment up to the plateau above the berg when he is captured again. But he manages first to hide the necklet, which is made of priceless rubies.\u000aAfter being taken to Laputa's new base, Crawfurd escapes immediate punishment by offering Laputa his knowledge of the location of the necklet in exchange for sparing his life. Laputa, who needs the necklet in order to convince his followers, but has not told anyone of its loss, goes alone with Crawfurd to search for the necklet. In the ravine, Crawfurd narrowly escapes once again and steals Laputa's horse to take him to Arcoll's headquarters.\u000aWith Laputa separated from his army, Arcoll's forces are able to quell the leaderless uprising. Meanwhile, Crawfurd returns to the cave, where he finds the treacherous Henriques dead outside, having been strangled by Laputa. Entering the cave, Crawfurd meets Laputa, who by now knows that all his plans have failed. Laputa destroys a rock bridge giving access to the cave, and then commits suicide by jumping into an underground river chasm.\u000aCrawfurd makes a daring escape by climbing a cascade up and out of the cave. He rejoins Arcoll and is instrumental in bringing about the disarmament of the native uprising and the subsequent peace. With Arcoll's help he is rewarded with a large portion of the treasure hidden in the cave and eventually returns to Scotland a rich man.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Editions ==\u000aPrester John, London: Tomas Nelson and Sons Ltd., 1922\u000aPrester John: The Famous Tale of Adventure, London: Pan Books, 1950, 223 pp. Printed in France, price 1/6.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aPrester John at Project Gutenberg\u000a Prester John public domain audiobook at LibriVox

aVWalter Reginald Hume (29 November 1873 \u2013 21 July 1943) was an Australian inventor and industrialist known for inventing modern techniques of producing pipes.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aHume travelled around Victoria in his early years with his father who gave lectures as a professional phrenologist. Walter Hume was 12 years old when his father died and in the altered family circumstances, Hume had to leave school to find work. He tried his hand at several trades, including plasterering.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Invention and industry ==\u000aDuring the depression of the 1890s, Hume and his elder brother, Ernest James Hume (ca.1869 \u2013 18 January 1929), joined forces and worked in country Victoria in construction, repair and farming, from which they developed a workshop business at Malmsbury, Victoria fencing droppers made from hoop iron. The brothers received their first patent for this work.\u000aThe brothers moved to South Australia to establish a second factory, but soon after closed down the original Malmsbury business, diversifying towards ornamental steel fencing. In 1910, they established Humes' Patent Cement Iron Syndicate Ltd.as a means of commercialising and developing the centrifugal process for the manfucature of concrete pipes invented by Hume. This technology had a profound impact internationally in developing modern drainage and sewerage systems. On 7 November 1940, a significant contract was signed with the South Australian Government, for construction of the Morgan Whyalla pipeline, to the value of £505,627. Between 1921 and 1926 they ran 250 miles (400 km) of reinforced concrete pipe for the Loveday Irrigation Project. The locomotive used to transport all materials has been restored and operates as an attraction at the Cobdogla Irrigation Museum.\u000aWilliam Dargie painted two portraits of Hume.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Death ==\u000aWalter Hume died of cancer in Melbourne on 21 July 1943.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVKosmos 818 (Russian: \u041a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0441 818 meaning Cosmos 818), also known as DS-P1-Yu No.78, was a Soviet satellite which was launched in 1976 as part of the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik programme. It was a 400-kilogram (880 lb) spacecraft, which was built by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau, and was used as a radar calibration target for anti-ballistic missile tests.\u000aA Kosmos-2I 63SM carrier rocket was used to launch Kosmos 818 from Site 133/1 of the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The launch occurred at 11:00 UTC on 18 May 1976, and resulted in the successfully insertion of the satellite into low Earth orbit. Upon reaching orbit, the satellite was assigned its Kosmos designation, and received the International Designator 1976-044A. The North American Aerospace Defense Command assigned it the catalogue number 08851.\u000aKosmos 818 was the seventy-eighth and penultimate DS-P1-Yu satellite to be launched, and the seventy-first to successfully reach orbit. It was operated in an orbit with a perigee of 267 kilometres (166 mi), an apogee of 468 kilometres (291 mi), 71 degrees of inclination, and an orbital period of 91.9 minutes. It remained in orbit until it decayed and reentered the atmosphere on 7 March 1977.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000a1976 in spaceflight\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVFlight 19 was the designation of a group of five Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers that disappeared over the Bermuda Triangle on December 5, 1945 after losing contact during a United States Navy overwater navigation training flight from Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale, Florida. All 14 airmen on the flight were lost, as were all 13 crew members of a Martin PBM Mariner flying boat that subsequently launched from Naval Air Station Banana River to search for Flight 19. The PBM aircraft was known to accumulate flammable gasoline vapors in its bilges, and professional investigators have assumed that the PBM most likely exploded in mid-air while searching for the flight. Navy investigators could not determine the exact cause of the loss of Flight 19.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Navigation training flight ==\u000aFlight 19 undertook a routine navigation and combat training exercise in TBM-type aircraft. The assignment was called "Navigation problem No. 1", a combination of bombing and navigation, which other flights had completed or were scheduled to undertake that day. The flight leader was United States Navy Lieutenant Charles Carroll Taylor, who had about 2,500 flying hours, mostly in aircraft of this type, while his trainee pilots each had 300 total, and 60 flight hours in the Avenger. Taylor had completed a combat tour in the Pacific theatre as torpedo bomber pilot on the aircraft carrier USS Hancock and had recently arrived from NAS Miami where he had also been a VTB instructor. The student pilots had recently completed other training missions in the area where the flight was to take place. They were U.S. Marine Captains Edward Joseph Powers and George William Stivers, U.S. Marine Second Lieutenant Forrest James Gerber and USN Ensign Joseph Tipton Bossi; their callsigns started with 'Fox Tare'.\u000aThe aircraft were four TBM-1Cs, BuNo 45714, 'FT3', BuNo 46094, 'FT36', BuNo 46325, 'FT81', BuNo 73209, 'FT117', and one TBM-3, BuNo 23307, 'FT28'. Each was fully fueled, and during pre-flight checks it was discovered they were all missing clocks. Navigation of the route was intended to teach dead reckoning principles, which involved calculating among other things elapsed time. The apparent lack of timekeeping equipment was not a cause for concern as it was assumed each man had his own watch. Takeoff was scheduled for 13:45 local time, but the late arrival of Taylor delayed departure until 14:10. Weather at NAS Fort Lauderdale was described as "favorable, sea state moderate to rough." Taylor was supervising the mission, and a trainee pilot had the role of leader out front.\u000aCalled "Naval Air Station, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, navigation problem No. 1," the exercise involved three different legs, but the actual flight should have flown four. After take off, they flew on heading 091° (almost due east) for 56 nmi (64 mi; 104 km) until reaching Hen and Chickens Shoals where low level bombing practice was carried out. The flight was to continue on that heading for another 67 nmi (77 mi; 124 km) before turning onto a course of 346° for 73 nmi (84 mi; 135 km), in the process over-flying Grand Bahama island. The next scheduled turn was to a heading of 241° to fly 120 nmi (140 mi; 220 km) at the end of which the exercise was completed and the Avengers would turn left to then return to NAS Ft. Lauderdale.\u000a\u000aRadio conversations between the pilots were overheard by base and other aircraft in the area. The practice bombing operation is known to have been carried out because at about 15:00 a pilot requested and was given permission to drop his last bomb. Forty minutes later, another flight instructor, Lieutenant Robert F. Cox in FT-74, forming up with his group of students for the same mission, received an unidentified transmission.\u000aAn unidentified crew member asked Powers, one of the students, for his compass reading. Powers replied: "I don't know where we are. We must have got lost after that last turn." Cox then transmitted; "This is FT-74, plane or boat calling 'Powers' please identify yourself so someone can help you." The response after a few moments was a request from the others in the flight for suggestions. FT-74 tried again and a man identified as FT-28 (Taylor) came on. "FT-28, this is FT-74, what is your trouble?" "Both of my compasses are out", Taylor replied, "and I am trying to find Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I am over land but it's broken. I am sure I'm in the Keys but I don't know how far down and I don't know how to get to Fort Lauderdale."\u000aFT-74 informed the NAS that aircraft were lost, then advised Taylor to put the sun on his port wing and fly north up the coast to Fort Lauderdale. Base operations then asked if the flight leader's aircraft was equipped with a standard YG (IFF transmitter), which could be used to triangulate the flight's position, but the message was not acknowledged by FT-28. (Later he would indicate that his transmitter was activated.) Instead, at 16:45, FT-28 radioed: "We are heading 030 degrees for 45 minutes, then we will fly north to make sure we are not over the Gulf of Mexico." During this time no bearings could be made on the flight, and IFF could not be picked up. Taylor was told to broadcast on 4805 kHz. This order was not acknowledged so he was asked to switch to 3000 kHz, the search and rescue frequency. Taylor replied \u2013 "I cannot switch frequencies. I must keep my planes intact."\u000aAt 16:56, Taylor was again asked to turn on his transmitter for YG if he had one. He did not acknowledge but a few minutes later advised his flight "Change course to 090 degrees (due east) for 10 minutes." About the same time someone in the flight said "Dammit, if we could just fly west we would get home; head west, dammit." This difference of opinion later led to questions about why the students did not simply head west on their own. It has been explained that this can be attributed to military discipline.\u000aAs the weather deteriorated, radio contact became intermittent, and it was believed that the five aircraft were actually by that time more than 200 nmi (230 mi; 370 km) out to sea east of the Florida peninsula. Taylor radioed "We'll fly 270 degrees west until landfall or running out of gas" and requested a weather check at 17:24. By 17:50 several land-based radio stations had triangulated Flight 19's position as being within a 100 nmi (120 mi; 190 km) radius of 29°N 79°W; Flight 19 was north of the Bahamas and well off the coast of central Florida, but nobody transmitted this information on an open, repetitive basis.\u000aAt 18:04, Taylor radioed to his flight "Holding 270, we didn't fly far enough east, we may as well just turn around and fly east again". By that time, the weather had deteriorated even more and the sun had since set. Around 18:20, Taylor's last message was received. (It has also been reported that Taylor's last message was received at 19:04.) He was heard saying "All planes close up tight ... we'll have to ditch unless landfall ... when the first plane drops below 10 gallons, we all go down together."\u000a\u000a\u000a== PBM-5 (Bureau Number 59225) ==\u000aAs it became obvious the flight was lost, air bases, aircraft, and merchant ships were alerted. A Consolidated PBY Catalina departed after 18:00 to search for Flight 19 and guide them back if they could be located. After dark, two Martin PBM Mariner flying boats originally scheduled for their own training flights were diverted to perform square pattern searches in the area west of 29°N 79°W. US Navy Squadron Training No. 49 PBM-5 BuNo 59225 took off at 19:27 from Naval Air Station Banana River (now Patrick Air Force Base), called in a routine radio message at 19:30 and was never heard from again.\u000aAt 21.15, the tanker SS Gaines Mills reported it had observed flames from an apparent explosion leaping 100 ft (30 m) high and burning for 10 minutes, at position 28.59°N 80.25°W\ufeff / 28.59; -80.25. Captain Shonna Stanley reported unsuccessfully searching for survivors through a pool of oil and aviation gasoline. The escort carrier USS Solomons also reported losing radar contact with an aircraft at the same position and time.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Investigation ==\u000aA 500-page Navy board of investigation report published a few months later made several observations:\u000aFlight leader Lt. Charles C. Taylor had mistakenly believed that the small islands he passed over were the Florida Keys, so his flight was over the Gulf of Mexico and heading northeast would take them to Florida. It was determined that Taylor had passed over the Bahamas as scheduled, and he did in fact lead his flight to the northeast over the Atlantic. The report noted that some subordinate officers did likely know their approximate position as indicated by radio transmissions stating that flying west would result in reaching the mainland.\u000aTaylor was not at fault because the compasses stopped working.\u000aThe loss of PBM-5 BuNo 59225 was attributed to an explosion.\u000aThis report was subsequently amended "cause unknown" by the Navy after Taylor's mother contended that the Navy was unfairly blaming her son for the loss of five aircraft and 14 men, when the Navy had neither the bodies nor the airplanes as evidence.\u000aHad Flight 19 actually been where Taylor believed it to be, the flight would have made landfall with the Florida coastline within 20 minutes, depending on how far down they were. However, a later reconstruction of the incident showed that the islands visible to Taylor were probably the Bahamas, well northeast of the Keys, and that Flight 19 was exactly where it should have been. The board of investigation found that because of his belief that he was on a base course toward Florida, Taylor actually guided the flight farther northeast and out to sea. Further, it was general knowledge at NAS Fort Lauderdale that if a pilot ever became lost in the area to fly a heading of 270° west (or in evening hours toward the sunset if the compass had failed). By the time the flight actually turned west, they were likely so far out to sea they had already passed their aircraft's fuel endurance. This factor combined with bad weather, and the ditching characteristics of the Avenger, meant that there was little hope of rescue, even if they had managed to stay afloat.\u000aIt is possible that Taylor overshot Castaway Cay and instead reached another land mass in southern Abaco Island. He then proceeded northwest as planned. He fully expected to find the Grand Bahama Island lying in front of him as expected. Instead, he eventually saw a land mass to his right side, the northern part of Abaco Island. Believing that this landmass to his right was the Grand Bahama Island and his compass was malfunctioning, he set a course to what he thought was southwest to head straight back to Fort Lauderdale. However, in reality this changed his course farther northwest, toward open ocean.\u000aTo further add to his confusion, he encountered a series of islands north of Abaco Island, which looks very similar to the Key West Islands. The control tower then suggested that Taylor's team should fly west, which would have taken them to the landmass of Florida eventually. Taylor headed for what he thought was west, but in reality was northwest, almost parallel to Florida.\u000aAfter trying that for a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was impossible for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Unrelated Avenger wreckage ==\u000aIn 1986, the wreckage of an Avenger was found off the Florida coast during the search for the wreckage of the Space Shuttle Challenger. Aviation archaeologist Jon Myhre raised this wreck from the ocean floor in 1990. He mistakenly believed it was one of the missing planes.\u000aIn 1991, a treasure-hunting expedition led by Graham Hawkes announced that the wreckage of five Avengers had been discovered off the coast of Florida, but that tail numbers revealed they were not Flight 19. In 2004 a BBC documentary showed Hawkes returning with a new submersible 12 years later and identifying one of the planes by its bureau number (a clearly readable 23990) as a flight lost at sea on 9 October 1943, over two years before Flight 19 (its crew all survived), but he was unable to definitively identify the other planes; the documentary concluded that "Despite the odds, they are just a random collection of accidents that came to rest in the same place 12 miles from home." But in March 2012 Hawkes was reported as stating that it had suited both him (and indirectly his investors) and the Pentagon to make the story go away because it was an expensive and time-consuming distraction, and that, while admitting he had found no conclusive evidence, he now thought he had in fact found Flight 19.\u000aRecords showed training accidents between 1942 and 1945 accounted for the loss of 95 aviation personnel from NAS Fort Lauderdale In 1992, another expedition located scattered debris on the ocean floor, but nothing could be identified. In the last decade, searchers have been expanding their area to include farther east, into the Atlantic Ocean, but the remains of Flight 19 have still never been confirmed found.\u000aA wrecked warplane with two bodies inside was retrieved by the Navy In the mid-1960s near Sebastian, Florida. The Navy initially said it was from Flight 19 but later recanted its statement. Despite Freedom of Information Act requests for details in 2013, the names are still not known because the Navy does not have enough information to identify the bodies.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Crews of Flight 19 and PBM-5 BuNo 59225 ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Charles Carroll Taylor ===\u000aThe flight leader, Lieutenant Charles Carroll Taylor (born October 25, 1917), graduated from Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in February 1942 and became a flight instructor in October of that year.\u000a\u000a\u000a== In popular culture ==\u000aThe pulp magazine Argosy published an account of the incident in 1974.\u000aThe 1977 science fiction film Close Encounters of the Third Kind featured a depiction of the Flight 19 planes being discovered in the Sonoran Desert, apparently set there by extraterrestrial forces and later their pilots are returned to Earth by peaceful alien captors.

aVThe International Association for Mission Studies (IAMS) is an international, inter-confessional and interdisciplinary professional society for the scholarly study of Christian mission and its impact in the world and the related field of intercultural theology. IAMS convenes international and regional conferences, facilitates collaborative study groups researching in mission studies, and publishes the journal Mission Studies.\u000aIAMS members include some 50 corporate members and more than 400 individual scholars of a range of academic disciplines and Christian traditions around the world who actively research on the historical and contemporary theory, practice, and impact of Christian mission in diverse social, economic and political environments.\u000aThe International Association for Mission Studies is a global forum for the scholarly study of Christian witness and its impact in the world. There are numerous other institutions dealing with mission studies, and they are mostly local centers for the study of mission; IAMS, on the other hand, \u201cassociates\u201d most of these institutions and missiologists with the global missiological forum and the worldwide research in mission studies.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe IAMS was founded in 1972, but the impulse dated from the vision of the late Olav G. Myklebust, then director of the Egede Institute in Oslo. In 1951 Myklebust produced a thirty-five-page proposal entitled \u201cAn International Institute of Scientific Missionary Research.\u201d He looked to \u201cthe establishment of an international association of missiologists (and others engaged in the scholarly study of mission) that from time to time would convene international conferences for the discussion of missionary subjects in a strictly scientific spirit and would publish a scholarly review of high standard.\u201d In 1955 \u201ca memorandum on an international organization for the scholarly study of the Christian world mission and the history and problems of the younger churches\u201d was discussed in Hamburg. Eleven years later in the same city the possibility of creating \u201ca larger meeting of European missiologists which might lead to the creation of a worldwide interconfessional missiological society\u201d was again discussed. A European consultation on mission studies held at the Selly Oak Colleges, Birmingham, England, in April 1968 brought things closer, but the decisive turning point was in Oslo in 1970 at a second European conference on mission studies when 74 participants from different denominations, countries and continents decided that an organization would be established. As a result, the first IAMS conference was held in 1972.\u000aIAMS links individual scholars and missiological associations from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific together with \u201cNorth America, Germany, the United Kingdom and Ireland, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, South Africa, India and elsewhere.\u201d IAMS is now \u201ca broadly ecumenical body including Roman Catholics, Orthodox, conciliar and evangelical Protestants, and members of the Pentecostal, charismatic and Independent churches.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a== Main objectives ==\u000aAs a scholarly association, IAMS\u2019 scholars and missionaries do extensive research in Christianity, the Christian church, Christian theology, evangelism, spreading the gospel and Christianization, and other Christian-related scholarly theological disciplines. All of these are seen from missiological point of view where missiology is seen as both a research discipline and a practical reflection on the Christian mission done in specific social context.\u000aIAMS' main goal is to bring together scholars, theologians, missiologists and missionaries who research in mission studies and can contribute to the science of missiology .\u000aThe main objectives of IAMS are the following:\u000a\u000ato promote the scholarly study of systematic, biblical, historical and practical questions relating to mission and intercultural theology\u000ato disseminate information concerning mission studies to all those engaged in that and related fields of study\u000ato promote fellowship, cooperation and mutual assistance in mission studies\u000ato organize international conferences of missiologists and intercultural theologians\u000ato encourage the creation of centres of research and scholarship\u000ato stimulate publications in missiology and intercultural theology.\u000a\u000a\u000a== IAMS General Assemblies ==\u000aSince 1972, thirteen international assemblies have been held in different countries on the different continents, each exploring specific mission studies themes:\u000a\u000aDriebergen, Netherlands (1972): Mission in the context of religions and secularization\u000aFrankurt, Germany (1974): Mission and movements of innovation in religion\u000aSan José, Costa Rica (1976): Tradition and reconstruction in mission: where are we in mission today?\u000aMaryknoll, New York, U.S.A.

An alternative site located inland at Acropole des Draveurs, would have provided the 800 meter vertical, but the site would have required major development and the finishing area too ended up alongside a river. Some locals and government officials flagged the 25 million dollar temporary venue as rather pointless and despite the proposal incorporating a tunnel for a train line which runs along the mountain range.\u000aOther proposals, such as staging the Men's Downhill events in Calgary were also considered, but deemed unrealistic.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Aftermath ==\u000aDuring the 104th IOC meeting held in Budapest the bid got 7 votes and lost in the first round to Salt Lake City.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Candidature files ===\u000aQuebec City 2002 Volume 1\u000aQuebec City 2002 Volume 2\u000aQuebec City 2002 Volume 3\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aNotes

aVTotal Recall 2070 is a science fiction television series first broadcast in 1999 on the Canadian television channel CHCH-TV and later the same year on the American Showtime channel. It was later syndicated in the United States with some editing to remove scenes of nudity, violence and (in most cases) strong language.\u000aThe series was filmed in Toronto, Ontario. It was a Canadian/German co-production. Only one season, consisting of 22 episodes, was produced.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production ==\u000aTotal Recall 2070 was created by Art Monterastelli The series is named after the 1990 film Total Recall, loosely based on Philip K. Dick's short story "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale", but it has been noted as sharing no major plot points or characters with it, other than the Rekall company and the concept of virtual vacations. Instead, a much larger influence in its plot elements and especially visual style has been recognized to be the 1982 film Blade Runner, itself a loose adaptation of Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. Series creator Art Monterastelli has admitted the stronger influence of Blade Runner over Total Recall, and explained, he thought doing a paranoid psychological thriller with a strong visual background reminiscent of Blade Runner, would be a better use of their limited budget, provide more creative opportunities to the writers, and even be more in line with the spirit of Dick's antihero storylines as found in his body of work, compared to the Total Recall action film. Despite the influence of his works to the series production, Dick is not credited on the series main or end titles.\u000aMost of this series was filmed at the Downsview Park studio, at the location of a former Canadian Forces Base in north Toronto. The series futuristic cityscape was created by John Gajdecki and his company Gajdecki Visual Effects, blending computer-generated images with a live-action soundstage set. Two or three levels of entire futuristic environment were constructed for the production and later mixed with the CGI.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Story ==\u000aTotal Recall 2070 takes place in a dark, crowded, industrial and cosmopolitan setting, with a noir sci-fi aesthetic. The government bureaucracy is heavily influenced by a small number of extremely powerful companies called "the Consortium" (including computer memory and virtual-reality vacation provider Rekall and android manufacturer Uber Braun). David Hume is a senior detective for the Citizens Protection Bureau (CPB), a police agency focused on general public safety. After his partner is killed by self-aware androids, he is partnered against his wishes with Ian Farve, a naive officer new to the department, who is himself secretly an "Alpha Class" android\u2014a model with a more complex psychological nature. Hume and the CPB often have conflicts with the Assessor's Office (the investigative agency that has sole jurisdiction over crimes related to the Consortium) and with the private security forces of Consortium companies. The main story arcs of the series concern the agendas of the Consortium, the mystery of Farve's origins, Hume's wife Olivia, whose memories have been tampered with, and the mysterious manufacturer of Alpha Class androids. Significant plot elements remain unresolved by the end of the series run, due to cancellation; a crucial story arc from the series was the suggestion that the memory expansion used on self-aware androids was part non-human DNA and that a material found by a remote base on Mars could create a hybrid of human and android DNA.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Main characters ===\u000aMichael Easton as David Hume: A CPB Detective whose original partner was killed by rogue androids.

However, much of the real power is held by the Consortium, composed of at least six multi-global companies that financed the colonization of Mars.\u000aThe known six companies are:\u000aRekall, the information technology powerhouse of the 21st century.

aVPoonam Ki Raat (Full moon Night) is a 1965 horror thriller film starring Manoj Kumar, Nandini, Shiv Kumar, and Kumud Chhugani. It was produced and directed by Kishore Sahu. The music was given by Salil Chowdhury, with lyrics by Shailendra.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000aChandan (Shiv Kumar), Prakash (Manoj Kumar) and their college mates are enjoying themselves while on an education tour at a site along with their Professor-in-charge when Sumer Singh (Rajendra Nath) rushes there by jeep to inform Chandan that his father Lala Baijnath (D.K. Sapru) is not keeping well as his illness has relapsed and that Chandan's mother has asked him to come home immediately. Chandan requests Prakash to accompany him to give moral support. Prakash agrees, as it will give him a chance to give Rekha (Bela Bose), a flirty classmate, the slip. They rush to Chandan's home-town along with Sumer Singh. Reaching the outskirts of the town, Prakash is shocked to learn while buying cigarettes at a stall that the mansion he is visiting is haunted and Lala Baijnath is suspected by the town of having murdered a beautiful young woman, Rani on the night of the full moon. It is believed that the spirit of the murdered woman, Rani haunts the mansion to this day. Prakash is curious and intrigued. Prakash meets Chandan's sisters, Jyoti and Nandini (Nandini Bhaktavatsala), but before a love triangle acquires any dimensions, the unexpected happens. Prakash, in the dead of the night, begins to hear a woman's voice singing and soon Prakash is captivated by the charms of an elusive spirit, Rani. A black cat is often seen moving around at night. The nurse Thelma requests the doctor (Kishore Sahu) for leave, but he refuses till another nurse is arranged to attend Lalaji. She goes missing, deepening the mystery. Lalaji is found lying senseless and paralyzed on the floor. The doctor states that someone tried to kill him. With every relative wishing for the early death of Lalaji and wanting a stake in the property, things take a dark turn where no one can be trusted and everyone is a suspect. This includes Lalaji's sister (Leela Mishra) and her son Ramesh and his girlfriend Mukta, Chandan's elder brother Narendra and his wife. Curious Prakash is determined to solve the mystery of the mansion and start an investigation on his own. He persuades Chandan to show him the closed rooms of Rani, in a separate annex, which was forbidden to enter by any one after her death twelve years ago by orders of Lala Baijnath. Prakash tells Chandan that someone is using the plush closed rooms and they are not unoccupied. After examining the place, they return. Chandan informs Prakash that Rani was a beautiful 24-year-old woman from Lucknow and was the daughter of a whore. She was brought by Lala to the mansion and provided all comforts and care. Prakash continues to hear mysterious sounds in the night from his bedroom. He follows a woman in white clothing to no avail. Meanwhile, Chandan and Prakash's camp mates along with the Professor visit the mansion on invitation by Chandan. Rekha throws her sandal into a well and dares Prakash to bring it out after hearing his swimming skills from others. To add further excitement, Nandini dumps her expensive bangle into the well and challenges Prakash to bring it out and keep the same as reward. Without wasting any time, Prakash jumps into the well and disappears from sight to the dismay of the onlookers. When he reappears after some time, he holds the corpse of the murdered nurse Thelma. Meanwhile, the mysterious woman in white clothing continues to haunt Prakash and he feels like having a nervous breakdown. As the time passes the day of full moon arrives again, warned by the gardener (Jankidas) and family doctor all are asked to stay vigilant to face any untoward incident. In the midnight, a silhouette with a knife in her hand approaches sleeping Lala Baijnath and stabs his blanket covered body. In the meantime, alert Prakash catches the murderer red-handed, who is none other than Nandini. She tries to put the blame on Prakash, but Lala Baijnath is put to sleep elsewhere by the doctor and the new nurse nearby to deceive the murderer. He recovers from his paralysis due to further shock, reveals to all that Nandini was actually the daughter of Rani and was suffering from the same mental disease as her mother, an illness whose attacks occur on full moon days and which had cost her life twelve years ago as she had accidentally fallen down from the stairs. Lala reveals further that the nurse Thelma entered the room and screamed when she saw Nandini trying to kill Lala, upon which Nandini stabbed her to death and threw her body from the window into the well. Lala gets a paralytic attack and collapses on the floor due to shock. After Lala's revelation, everyone present is in state of shock. When Nandini claims to the doctor that she is innocent, the doctor agrees and blames the full moon night for the tragedy and assures her that she will be treated by him. Nandini leaves the place satisfied and sings the same haunted song as she marches ahead towards the open terrace.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cast ==\u000aManoj Kumar as Prakash Gupta\u000aNandini Bhaktavatsala as Nandini\u000aKumud Chhugani as Jyoti, Chandan's sister\u000aShiv Kumar as Chandan\u000aPrem Chopra as Peter, nurse's boyfriend\u000aRajendra Nath as Sumer Singh, Munim's son\u000aD.K.

aVThe Rudra Mahalaya Temple, also known as Rudramal, is a destroyed/desecrated temple complex at Siddhpur in the Patan district of Gujarat, India. Its construction was started in 943 AD by Mularaja and completed in 1140 AD by Jayasimha Siddharaja, the rulers of the Chaulukya dynasty. The temple was destroyed by Alauddin Khalji, and later Ahmed Shah I (1410\u201344) desecrated and substantially demolished this temple, and also converted part of it into the congregational mosque (Jami Masjid) of the city. Two torans (porches) and four pillars of the former central structure still stand along with western part of the complex used as a congregational mosque.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aSiddhpur, historically known as Sristhal. Sidhpur, under the rulers of Chaulukya dynasty, was a prominent town in the 10th century. In the tenth century (943 AD) Mularaja, the founder of the Chaulukya dynasty of Gujarat, started the erection of the Rudra Mahalay temple. In his youth, Muladev had slain his maternal uncle, usurped his throne, and murdered the whole of his mother's kindred; and in old age his crimes hung heavily on his mind. He made pilgrimages and courted the favour of Brahmins from far and near. To a band of them he gave Sristhal, and committing the kingdom to his son Chamundaraja, he retired there to end his days in their company (996 AD). But the Rudra Mahalay was still incomplete, nor was it finished till 1140 AD.\u000aAn inscription and ballad regarding its construction says,\u000a\u000aIn Samvat ten (?) hundred, begun by Maharaj Mahadev,\u000aIn Samvat twelve hundred and two, Siddharaj completed the work ;\u000aIn Samvat twelve hundred two, Magh month, Krishna paksh,\u000aOn Monday the fourteenth, in the Nakshatra Shravan and Varyan Yoga,\u000aSiddharaj, in the Rudra Mala, Shivashankar established.\u000a\u000aIt was during the 12th century, in 1140 AD, that Jayasimha Siddharaja (1094\u20131144) consecrated the temple complex and it became the principal temple complex of Siddhpur.\u000aAccording to another legend, two Parmars from Malwa, named Govinddas and Madhavdas, took up their haunt among the rush grass that covered the neighbourhood of the Rudra Mahalaya, and lived by plunder. There they found the foundations of a temple and Shiva linga, and said that in the night they had seen heavenly beings. This was told to Siddharaj and led to the erection or completion of the temple.\u000aIn Mirat-i-Ahmadi, Ali Muhammad Khan writes, "The king on signifying his intention of building the temple, requested the astrologers, it is said, to appoint a fortunate hour; and they at this time predicted the destruction of the building." Then Siddha Raja caused images of "horse lords" and other great kings to be placed in the temple, and "near them a representation of himself in the attitude of supplication, with an inscription praying that, even if the land was laid waste, this temple might not be destroyed."\u000aAlauddin Khalji sent an army under Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan, who dismantled the temple complex in 1296 AD (Samvat 1353). The temple was further destroyed and the western part of it was converted into congregational mosque (Jami Mosque) by Ahmed Shah I (1410\u201344) of Muzaffarid dynasty in 1414 or 1415.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Architecture ==\u000aThe original temple, completed in 1140 to lavish proportions with extensive ornamentation, consisted of a roof measuring 32 feet (9.8 m), much larger than the Abu temple. Its overall dimensions were 300 by 230 feet (91 m × 70 m) with the central building 150 feet (46 m) in length. It was a triple storied temple with 1,600 pillars, 12 entrance doors, and 11 shrines of Rudra positioned around it. The sanctum was located on the west and there was also a 'mandapa' or hall which had porches on the eastern, northern, and southern wings. Today only a few remnants of this complex are seen, such as two "torans" (porches) and four pillars. One "toran" is elaborately ornamented; the eastern gate which leads to the Saraswati river still stands; the remaining pillars have highly ornamented carvings. Kirti Stambh of North has survived. The western part of complex converted into the congregation mosque is also there.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of Monuments of National Importance in Gujarat\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000aBibliography\u000aSastri, Kallidaikurichi Aiyah Nilakanta; Congress, Indian History (1907).

aVFlue-gas desulfurization (FGD) is a set of technologies used to remove sulfur dioxide (SO\u000a2) from exhaust flue gases of fossil-fuel power plants, and from the emissions of other sulfur oxide emitting processes.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Methods ==\u000aAs stringent environmental regulations regarding SO2 emissions have been enacted in many countries, SO\u000a2 is now being removed from flue gases by a variety of methods. Below are common methods used:\u000aWet scrubbing using a slurry of alkaline sorbent, usually limestone or lime, or seawater to scrub gases;\u000aSpray-dry scrubbing using similar sorbent slurries;\u000aWet sulfuric acid process recovering sulfur in the form of commercial quality sulfuric acid;\u000aSNOX Flue gas desulphurisation removes sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates from flue gases;\u000aDry sorbent injection systems that introduce powdered hydrated lime (or other sorbent material) into exhaust ducts to eliminate SO2 and SO3 from process emissions.\u000aFor a typical coal-fired power station, flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) may remove 90 percent or more of the SO\u000a2 in the flue gases.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aMethods of removing sulfur dioxide from boiler and furnace exhaust gases have been studied for over 150 years. Early ideas for flue gas desulfurization were established in England around 1850.\u000aWith the construction of large-scale power plants in England in the 1920s, the problems associated with large volumes of SO\u000a2 from a single site began to concern the public. The SO\u000a2 emissions problem did not receive much attention until 1929, when the House of Lords upheld the claim of a landowner against the Barton Electricity Works of the Manchester Corporation for damages to his land resulting from SO\u000a2 emissions. Shortly thereafter, a press campaign was launched against the erection of power plants within the confines of London. This outcry led to the imposition of SO\u000a2 controls on all such power plants.\u000aThe first major FGD unit at a utility was installed in 1931 at Battersea Power Station, owned by London Power Company. In 1935, an FGD system similar to that installed at Battersea went into service at Swansea Power Station. The third major FGD system was installed in 1938 at Fulham Power Station. These three early large-scale FGD installations were abandoned during World War II. Large-scale FGD units did not reappear at utilities until the 1970s, where most of the installations occurred in the United States and Japan.\u000aAs of June 1973, there were 42 FGD units in operation, 36 in Japan and 6 in the United States, ranging in capacity from 5 MW to 250 MW. As of around 1999 and 2000, FGD units were being used in 27 countries, and there were 678 FGD units operating at a total power plant capacity of about 229 gigawatts. About 45% of the FGD capacity was in the U.S., 24% in Germany, 11% in Japan, and 20% in various other countries. Approximately 79% of the units, representing about 199 gigawatts of capacity, were using lime or limestone wet scrubbing. About 18% (or 25 gigawatts) utilized spray-dry scrubbers or sorbent injection systems.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sulfuric acid mist formation ==\u000aFossil fuels such as coal and oil can contain a significant amount of sulfur. When fossil fuels are burned, about 95 percent or more of the sulfur is generally converted to sulfur dioxide (SO\u000a2). Such conversion happens under normal conditions of temperature and of oxygen present in the flue gas. However, there are circumstances under which such reaction may not occur.\u000aWhen flue gas has too much oxygen, the SO\u000a2 further oxidizes into sulfur trioxide (SO\u000a3). Too much oxygen is only one of the ways that SO\u000a3 is formed. Gas temperature is also an important factor. At about 800 °C, formation of SO\u000a3 is favored. Another way that SO\u000a3 can be formed is through catalysis by metals in the fuel. Such reaction is particularly true for heavy fuel oil, where a significant amount of vanadium is present. In whatever way SO\u000a3 is formed, it does not behave like SO\u000a2 in that it forms a liquid aerosol known as sulfuric acid (H\u000a2SO\u000a4) mist that is very difficult to remove. Generally, about 1% of the sulfur dioxide will be converted to SO\u000a3. Sulfuric acid mist is often the cause of the blue haze that often appears as the flue gas plume dissipates. Increasingly, this problem is being addressed by the use of wet electrostatic precipitators.\u000a\u000a\u000a== FGD chemistry ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Basic principles ===\u000aMost FGD systems employ two stages: one for fly ash removal and the other for SO\u000a2 removal. Attempts have been made to remove both the fly ash and SO\u000a2 in one scrubbing vessel. However, these systems experienced severe maintenance problems and low removal efficiency. In wet scrubbing systems, the flue gas normally passes first through a fly ash removal device, either an electrostatic precipitator or a baghouse, and then into the SO\u000a2-absorber. However, in dry injection or spray drying operations, the SO\u000a2 is first reacted with the lime, and then the flue gas passes through a particulate control device.\u000aAnother important design consideration associated with wet FGD systems is that the flue gas exiting the absorber is saturated with water and still contains some SO\u000a2. These gases are highly corrosive to any downstream equipment such as fans, ducts, and stacks. Two methods that may minimize corrosion are: (1) reheating the gases to above their dew point, or (2) using materials of construction and designs that allow equipment to withstand the corrosive conditions. Both alternatives are expensive. Engineers determine which method to use on a site-by-site basis.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Scrubbing with an alkali solid or solution ===\u000a\u000aSO\u000a2 is an acid gas, and, therefore, the typical sorbent slurries or other materials used to remove the SO\u000a2 from the flue gases are alkaline. The reaction taking place in wet scrubbing using a CaCO\u000a3 (limestone) slurry produces CaSO\u000a3 (calcium sulfite) and may be expressed in the simplified dry form as:\u000aCaCO\u000a3(s) + SO\u000a2(g) \u2192 CaSO\u000a3(s) + CO2(g)\u000aWhen wet scrubbing with a Ca(OH)2 (hydrated lime) slurry, the reaction also produces CaSO3 (calcium sulfite) and may be expressed in the simplified dry form as:\u000aCa(OH)2(s) + SO2(g) \u2192 CaSO3(s) + H2O(l)\u000aWhen wet scrubbing with a Mg(OH)2 (magnesium hydroxide) slurry, the reaction produces MgSO3 (magnesium sulfite) and may be expressed in the simplified dry form as:\u000aMg(OH)2(s) + SO2(g) \u2192 MgSO3(s) + H2O(l)\u000aTo partially offset the cost of the FGD installation, some designs, particularly dry sorbent injection systems, further oxidize the CaSO3 (calcium sulfite) to produce marketable CaSO4-2H2O (gypsum) that can be of high enough quality to use in wallboard and other products. The process by which this synthetic gypsum is created is also known as forced oxidaton:\u000aCaSO3(aq) + 2H2O(l) + ½O2(g) \u2192 CaSO4 · 2H2O(s)\u000aA natural alkaline usable to absorb SO2 is seawater. The SO\u000a2 is absorbed in the water, and when oxygen is added reacts to form sulfate ions SO4- and free H+. The surplus of H+ is offset by the carbonates in seawater pushing the carbonate equilibrium to release CO2 gas:\u000aSO2(g) + H2O(l) + ½O2(g) \u2192 SO42\u2212(aq) + 2H+\u000aHCO3\u2212 + H+ \u2192 H2O(l) + CO2(g)\u000aIn industry caustic (NaOH) is often used to scrub SO\u000a2, producing sodium sulfite:\u000a2NaOH(aq) + SO2(g) \u2192 Na2SO3(aq) + H2O(l)\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Types of wet scrubbers used in FGD ====\u000aTo promote maximum gas\u2013liquid surface area and residence time, a number of wet scrubber designs have been used, including spray towers, venturis, plate towers, and mobile packed beds. Because of scale buildup, plugging, or erosion, which affect FGD dependability and absorber efficiency, the trend is to use simple scrubbers such as spray towers instead of more complicated ones. The configuration of the tower may be vertical or horizontal, and flue gas can flow cocurrently, countercurrently, or crosscurrently with respect to the liquid. The chief drawback of spray towers is that they require a higher liquid-to-gas ratio requirement for equivalent SO\u000a2 removal than other absorber designs.\u000aFGD scrubbers produce a scaling wastewater that requires treatment to meet discharge regulations. However, technological advancements in ion exchange membranes and electrodialysis systems has enabled high efficiency treatment of FGD wastewater to meet recent EPA discharge limits. The treatment approach is similar for other highly scaling industrial wastewaters.\u000a\u000a\u000a===== Venturi-rod scrubbers =====\u000a\u000aA venturi scrubber is a converging/diverging section of duct. The converging section accelerates the gas stream to high velocity. When the liquid stream is injected at the throat, which is the point of maximum velocity, the turbulence caused by the high gas velocity atomizes the liquid into small droplets, which creates the surface area necessary for mass transfer to take place. The higher the pressure drop in the venturi, the smaller the droplets and the higher the surface area. The penalty is in power consumption.\u000aFor simultaneous removal of SO\u000a2 and fly ash, venturi scrubbers can be used. In fact, many of the industrial sodium-based throwaway systems are venturi scrubbers originally designed to remove particulate matter. These units were slightly modified to inject a sodium-based scrubbing liquor. Although removal of both particles and SO\u000a2 in one vessel can be economic, the problems of high pressure drops and finding a scrubbing medium to remove heavy loadings of fly ash must be considered. However, in cases where the particle concentration is low, such as from oil-fired units, it can be more effective to remove particulate and SO\u000a2 simultaneously.\u000a\u000a\u000a===== Packed bed scrubbers =====\u000aA packed scrubber consists of a tower with packing material inside. This packing material can be in the shape of saddles, rings, or some highly specialized shapes designed to maximize contact area between the dirty gas and liquid. Packed towers typically operate at much lower pressure drops than venturi scrubbers and are therefore cheaper to operate. They also typically offer higher SO\u000a2 removal efficiency. The drawback is that they have a greater tendency to plug up if particles are present in excess in the exhaust air stream.\u000a\u000a\u000a===== Spray towers =====\u000a\u000aA spray tower is the simplest type of scrubber. It consists of a tower with spray nozzles, which generate the droplets for surface contact. Spray towers are typically used when circulating a slurry (see below). The high speed of a venturi would cause erosion problems, while a packed tower would plug up if it tried to circulate a slurry.\u000aCounter-current packed towers are infrequently used because they have a tendency to become plugged by collected particles or to scale when lime or limestone scrubbing slurries are used.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Scrubbing reagent ====\u000aAs explained above, alkaline sorbents are used for scrubbing flue gases to remove SO2. Depending on the application, the two most important are lime and sodium hydroxide (also known as caustic soda). Lime is typically used on large coal- or oil-fired boilers as found in power plants, as it is very much less expensive than caustic soda. The problem is that it results in a slurry being circulated through the scrubber instead of a solution. This makes it harder on the equipment. A spray tower is typically used for this application. The use of lime results in a slurry of calcium sulfite (CaSO3) that must be disposed of. Fortunately, calcium sulfite can be oxidized to produce by-product gypsum (CaSO4 · 2H2O) which is marketable for use in the building products industry.\u000aCaustic soda is limited to smaller combustion units because it is more expensive than lime, but it has the advantage that it forms a solution rather than a slurry. This makes it easier to operate. It produces a "spent caustic" solution of sodium sulfite/bisulfite (depending on the pH), or sodium sulfate that must be disposed of. This is not a problem in a kraft pulp mill for example, where this can be a source of makeup chemicals to the recovery cycle.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Scrubbing with sodium sulfite solution ===\u000aIt is possible to scrub sulfur dioxide by using a cold solution of sodium sulfite, this forms a sodium hydrogen sulfite solution. By heating this solution it is possible to reverse the reaction to form sulfur dioxide and the sodium sulfite solution. Since the sodium sulfite solution is not consumed, it is called a regenerative treatment. The application of this reaction is also known as the Wellman\u2013Lord process.\u000aIn some ways this can be thought of as being similar to the reversible liquid\u2013liquid extraction of an inert gas such as xenon or radon (or some other solute which does not undergo a chemical change during the extraction) from water to another phase. While a chemical change does occur during the extraction of the sulfur dioxide from the gas mixture, it is the case that the extraction equilibrium is shifted by changing the temperature rather than by the use of a chemical reagent.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Gas phase oxidation followed by reaction with ammonia ===\u000aA new, emerging flue gas desulfurization technology has been described by the IAEA. It is a radiation technology where an intense beam of electrons is fired into the flue gas at the same time as ammonia is added to the gas. The Chendu power plant in China started up such a flue gas desulfurization unit on a 100 MW scale in 1998. The Pomorzany power plant in Poland also started up a similar sized unit in 2003 and that plant removes both sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Both plants are reported to be operating successfully. However, the accelerator design principles and manufacturing quality need further improvement for continuous operation in industrial conditions.\u000aNo radioactivity is required or created in the process. The electron beam is generated by a device similar to the electron gun in a TV set. This device is called an accelerator. This is an example of a radiation chemistry process where the physical effects of radiation are used to process a substance.\u000aThe action of the electron beam is to promote the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur(VI) compounds. The ammonia reacts with the sulfur compounds thus formed to produce ammonium sulfate, which can be used as a nitrogenous fertilizer. In addition, it can be used to lower the nitrogen oxide content of the flue gas. This method has attained industrial plant scale.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Facts and statistics ==\u000aThe information in this section was obtained from a US EPA published fact sheet.\u000aFlue gas desulfurization scrubbers have been applied to combustion units firing coal and oil that range in size from 5 MW to 1500 MW. Scottish Power are spending £400 million installing FGD at Longannet power station, which has a capacity of over 2 GW. Dry scrubbers and spray scrubbers have generally been applied to units smaller than 300 MW.\u000aFGD has been fitted by RWE npower at Aberthaw Power Station in south Wales using the seawater process and works successfully on the 1580MW plant.\u000aApproximately 85% of the flue gas desulfurization units installed in the US are wet scrubbers, 12% are spray dry systems, and 3% are dry injection systems.\u000aThe highest SO\u000a2 removal efficiencies (greater than 90%) are achieved by wet scrubbers and the lowest (less than 80%) by dry scrubbers. However, the newer designs for dry scrubbers are capable of achieving efficiencies in the order of 90%.\u000aIn spray drying and dry injection systems, the flue gas must first be cooled to about 10\u201320 °C above adiabatic saturation to avoid wet solids deposition on downstream equipment and plugging of baghouses.\u000aThe capital, operating and maintenance costs per short ton of SO\u000a2 removed (in 2001 US dollars) are:\u000aFor wet scrubbers larger than 400 MW, the cost is $200 to $500 per ton\u000aFor wet scrubbers smaller than 400 MW, the cost is $500 to $5,000 per ton\u000aFor spray dry scrubbers larger than 200 MW, the cost is $150 to $300 per ton\u000aFor spray dry scrubbers smaller than 200 MW, the cost is $500 to $4,000 per ton\u000a\u000a\u000a== Alternative methods of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions ==\u000aAn alternative to removing sulfur from the flue gases after burning is to remove the sulfur from the fuel before or during combustion. Hydrodesulfurization of fuel has been used for treating fuel oils before use. Fluidized bed combustion adds lime to the fuel during combustion. The lime reacts with the SO2 to form sulfates which become part of the ash. This elemental sulfur is then separated and finally recovered at the end of the process for further usage in, for example, agricultural products. Safety is one of the greatest benefits of this method, as the whole process takes place at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature. This method has been developed by Paqell, a joint venture between Shell Global Solutions and Paques.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aIncineration\u000aScrubber\u000aFlue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion\u000aFlue-gas stacks\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aSchematic process flow of FGD plant\u000a5000 MW FGD Plant (includes a detailed process flow diagram)\u000aAlstom presentation to UN-ECE on air pollution control (includes process flow diagram for dry, wet and seawater FGD)\u000aFlue Gas Treatment article including the removal of hydrogen chloride, sulfur trioxide, and other heavy metal particles such as mercury.\u000aInstitute of Clean Air Companies \u2013 national trade association representing emissions control manufacturers

aVQuebec cider is crafted in the apple-producing regions of Montérégie, Eastern Townships, Chaudière-Appalaches, the Laurentides, Charlevoix and Capitale-Nationale, in Canada. The revival of cider is a relatively new phenomenon, since Quebec's alcohol regulating body, the Régie des alcools, des courses et des jeux began issuing permits to produce craft cider only in 1988. In 2008, some 40 cider makers were producing more than 100 apple-based alcoholic beverages.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe honour of planting the first apple tree in the history of Quebec goes to Louis Hébert, apothecary from Paris and New France's first settler. He did so around 1617 on the site where Quebec City was founded in 1608. A good number of the first French settlers to the colony were Normans who brought over the apple cider craft. Sizable orchards developed in the region of New France, particularly on Île d'Orléans.\u000aThe Sulpicians, who settled on the Island of Montreal in 1657, possessed, beginning in 1666, a little orchard inside the fenced garden of the seminary on Notre-Dame Street. A bigger orchard was planted on the side of Mount Royal, in the mid-1670s. On this site, the mission de la Montagne where Marguerite Bourgeoys had her school, they erected a fort, in 1685, where they were using two cider presses. In 1705, the production of cider was about 30 barrels, and part was sold outside the religious community.\u000aIn 1731, the orchards covered 90 arpents (76.0 acres) on the Island of Montreal, on the side of the mountain and around town. From 1731 to 1781, the surface area occupied by the orchards rose from 90 to 402 arpents (0.31 to 1.37 km2). The common cultivars at the time were the Calville blanc, Calville rouge, Famous, Reinette, Bourassa, Pomme blanche, Pomme grise of Montreal and Sauvageon. These cultivars have been supplanted by others since.\u000aThe British Conquest of 1760, confirmed by the cession of 1763, brought along all kinds of changes in the habits of French Canadians. Great Britain's protectionist trade policy, limiting exchanges within the British Empire, favoured the importation of alcohols from England (whisky, gin) and Antilles (rum), and discouraged all the artisanal productions of the inhabitants. Only beer, produced by industrialists from Great Britain (or of British origin), expanded significantly in the 19th century.\u000aOn August 15, 1807, in Le Canadien of Quebec City, there was an article in which the author deplored that more efforts were not made to encourage the cultivation of apples on Île d'Orléans and to export cider, which he judged "superior or at least equal to that of Europe and the United States". He suggested also that the production could serve to diminish the excessive consumption of rum, a "source of disastrous ruins in a lot of families."\u000aThe artisanal production of cider continued until the period of prohibition on alcohol in the middle of the 1910s. In April 1919, a great majority of Quebecers (78.62%) voted yes in a Quebec referendum asking them if "beer, ciders, and light wines" should be allowed, as excluded from the list of prohibited alcoholic beverages. However, in 1920, a legislative omission rendered cider illegal in the territory of Quebec. Indeed, the Canadian Alcoholic Beverages Act which ended prohibition and created the monopoly of the Commission des liqueurs du Québec, did not legislate on cider, which consequently found itself in a judicial void. It was only in 1970, half a century later, that the situation was corrected. During this period, cider continued to be produced by several apple growers, but they were not legally permitted to sell it.\u000aWhen cider became legal again, Quebecers were served a cider produced industrially, which was disliked very much by many and gave it a bad reputation. Makers were unable to supply to the demand and inundated the market with products that had no maturity. A whole generation experienced the Grand Sec d'Orléans, which to many, evoked what is most undrinkable when it comes to alcohol. Sales declined after a few years, and cider, barely gotten out of its "dark age", was plunged back into it. From about 1,000,000 imperial gallons (4,500,000 l; 1,200,000 US gal) a year in 1971, the production dropped to 300,000 imperial gallons (1,400,000 l; 360,000 US gal) per year in 1982. It was only at the end of the 1980s when the first craft production permits were issued by the Régie des alcools, des courses et des jeux du Québec, that Quebec cider was truly reborn, about the same time as beer and wine, for the same reason.\u000aThe ciders crafted by small cider makers then multiplied, often avoiding to use the word cidre on the bottle to avoid alarming the consumers. The first Quebec ice cider was crafted by Christian Barthomeuf in Dunham in the Eastern Townships during the winter of 1989\u20131990. The first bottles bear the "1990" millésime. Ten years later, cider makers obtained the authorization to name their products cidre de glace (ice cider). A regulation on cider was finally adopted by the National Assembly of Quebec in November 2008.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Types ==\u000aQuebec cider makers prepare various types of ciders, which are categorized according to the production method, the percentage of alcohol, the effervescence, or the residual sugar content.\u000aCider is said to be light when it contains 7% of alcohol or less, strong when it contains 7% to 13%, and apéritif when between 13% to 20%. Flavoured cider, perfumed with aromas of berries, honey or maple, generally contains less than 10% alcohol.\u000aAs it is with wine, cider can be still (without bubble) or sparkling (with bubbles).\u000aSparkling apple cider is crafted either by injecting carbon dioxide, in closed vats using the Charmat process or the traditional champenoise method. The result is a cider said to be semi-sparkling when in impregnated naturally with carbon dioxide, under low pressure (less than 2 standard atmospheres (200 kPa)), carbonated semi-sparkling when impregnated artificially with carbon dioxide, also under low pressure. It is sparkling when impregnated naturally with carbon dioxide under a pressure between 3 to 5 standard atmospheres (300 to 510 kPa) and carbonated sparkling, if artificially impregnated with carbon dioxide under of the same pressure of 3 to 5 standard atmospheres (300 to 510 kPa).\u000aApple mistelle is a cider obtained from a must kept fresh, that is unfermented, to which alcohol is added.\u000aIce cider, an innovation from Quebec, is crafted by pressing apples naturally frozen by winter's cold. Similar to the late harvest of grapes, apples picked during winter allow for a must with a high sugar content, when water, turned into ice, is separated from the apples. This step is called the cryoconcentration of sugar. The final result, after the fermentation of the must, is a liqueur-like and mellow liquid, containing between 9 and 13% of alcohol.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Regions ==\u000aQuebec counts six cider-producing regions, which correspond more or less with its apple-producing regions: the Montérégie, Eastern Townships, Chaudière-Appalaches, the Laurentides, Charlevoix, and Capitale-Nationale.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Apples ==\u000aCultivation of apples is well developed in Quebec, which produces in quantity several cultivars of apples, the McIntosh, Paula Red, Spartan, Cortland, Empire, Vista Bella and Jersey Mac being among the most common.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aQuebec beer\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aMartin, Paul-Louis (2002).

aV"We Built This Glee Club" is the eleventh episode of the sixth season of the American musical television series Glee, and the 119th overall. The episode was written by Aristotle Kousakis, directed by Joaquin Sedillo, and first aired on March 13, 2015, on Fox in the United States.\u000aThe episode features the Show Choir Sectionals competition, with New Directions desperate to win and save their club. Rachel Berry must decide whether to accept a role in a new Broadway show or return to school at NYADA. Sue Sylvester, who is the new coach of Vocal Adrenaline, is apparently going all out in her perennial efforts to defeat New Directions, though she later claims to have had other plans. The episode features the return of special guest star Jonathan Groff as Jesse St. James.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000aWhile New Directions practice a dance routine for the imminent Sectionals competition, their new members from the Warblers complain that Roderick (Noah Guthrie) and Spencer Porter (Marshall Williams) are poor dancers, and will ruin the number. Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin) suggests that they stay in the back for the good of the team, and they later go to her for help with their dancing. While they practice, Spencer injures his ankle. Football coach Sheldon Beiste diagnoses a very severe sprain, and recommends that he not compete, but Spencer insists that he be given a cortisone shot on the day of Sectionals despite the risk of permanent damage to his ankle.\u000aSam Evans (Chord Overstreet) continues to urge Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) to return to school at NYADA, while she seems more intent on accepting the role she has been offered on Broadway. Alone, she begins to sing and is joined by former boyfriend and rival Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), who tells her that he is the male lead in that Broadway musical and urges her to take the part. Later, Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) and Rachel talk, and he tells her that she has the rare chance to revisit her decision of a year ago and take a different path, though he will support her whatever she decides.\u000aBoxes placed in the choir room turn out to be glitter bombs, which inundate the room and destroy the piano. People throughout the school are vomiting, and Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) discovers that Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) tainted the water supply and sent the bombs. She also firebombs his car. Will gets his revenge by masquerading as Sue's hairdresser and forcibly shaving her head bald.\u000aAt Sectionals, the Falconers go first, performing with live falcons. Vocal Adrenaline, coached by Sue who is wearing a wig resembling her normal hair, does an elaborate performance with set pieces, ending their final song with a pair of human cannonballs. Rachel leads New Directions in a show circle pep talk before their set. Spencer is about to get his cortisone shot, but Roderick stops him, and offers another plan: Spencer appears in "Chandelier" by swinging in on one of the stage's chandeliers, and sings and dances in the final number while on crutches. After the judges deliberate, New Directions wins Sectionals, with a disgruntled Vocal Adrenaline in second place.\u000aAfterward, Sue meets Will and claims that because Will was one of the few people to stand up for her during the recent television exposé of her by Geraldo Rivera, she planned her pranks to help New Directions perform better, and deliberately sabotaged Vocal Adrenaline by devising a performance that would alienate the judges. Rachel finds Jesse in the auditorium, and tells him that she has decided to return to NYADA, and has turned down the Broadway role. Jesse is disappointed but understanding, and they kiss. New Directions says goodbye to Rachel as they place the Sectionals trophy in their trophy case, and decide to also bring back the trophies from past years. Sue observes this from the hallway with a small smile.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production ==\u000aThe episode was written by first-time Glee writer and script coordinator Aristotle Kousakis, and directed by first-time Glee director and regular director of photography Joaquin Sedillo. Special guest star Jonathan Groff returned as former Vocal Adrenaline lead singer and coach Jesse St. James.\u000aRecurring characters included New Directions members Kitty Wilde (Tobin), Spencer Porter (Williams), Mason McCarthy (Billy Lewis Jr.), Madison McCarthy (Laura Dreyfuss), Jane Hayward (Samantha Marie Ware), Roderick (Guthrie), Myron Muskovitz (J.J. Totah) and Alistair (Finneas O'Connell), returning Sectionals judges Rod Remington (Bill A. Jones) and Donna Landries (Patricia Forte), and Vocal Adrenaline lead singer Clint (Max George). Fortune Feimster is introduced as Butch Melman, a champion dog trainer who also judges the Sectionals competition.\u000aThe episode features seven musical cover versions. "Listen to Your Heart" by Roxette is sung by Michele and Groff. "Broken Wings" by Mr. Mister is sung by the Falconers, who are uncredited. "We Built This City" by Starship and "Mickey" by Toni Basil are sung by George with Vocal Adrenaline. "Take Me to Church" by Hozier is sung by Guthrie, Tobin, Ware, and New Directions. "Chandelier" by Sia is sung by Dreyfuss, Tobin, Ware, and New Directions. "Come Sail Away" by Styx is sung by Lewis Jr., Dreyfuss, Williams, Tobin, and New Directions. Six of the seven songs, excluding "Broken Wings", were released on the EP Glee: The Music, We Built This Glee Club on March 17, 2015.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reception ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ratings ===\u000aThe episode was watched by 2.02 million viewers and received a 0.7 rating/2 share in the adult 18-49 demographic.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Critical response ===\u000aLauren Hoffman from Vulture gave the episode four out of five stars, and commented the episode was "a welcome return to form, like slipping under a warm, comfortable blanket." Christopher Rogers from Hollywood Life wrote that "If Glee's trying to go out with a bang, they're certainly accomplishing that\u2014at least in the literal sense." The A.V. Club's Brandon Nowalk rated the episode a "C\u2212" and stated that "a farewell tour without one last Sylvester scheme would be missing some ineffable quality vital to the genetic makeup of Glee." Miranda Wicker from TV Fanatic gave the episode four out of five stars, and reminisced that "knowing that this was the last time we'll see the New Directions in competition just has me feeling a little weepy."\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a"We Built This Glee Club" on IMDb\u000a"We Built This Glee Club" at TV.com

aVAnimism (from Latin anima, "breath, spirit, life") is the religious belief that objects, places and creatures all possess a distinct spiritual essence. Potentially, animism perceives all things\u2014animals, plants, rocks, rivers, weather systems, human handiwork and perhaps even words\u2014as animated and alive.\u000aAnimism is used in the anthropology of religion as a term for the belief system of many indigenous peoples, especially in contrast to the relatively more recent development of organised religions. Although each culture has its own different mythologies and rituals, "animism" is said to describe the most common, foundational thread of indigenous peoples' "spiritual" or "supernatural" perspectives. The animistic perspective is so widely held and inherent to most indigenous peoples that they often do not even have a word in their languages that corresponds to "animism" (or even "religion"); the term is an anthropological construct.\u000aLargely due to such ethnolinguistic and cultural discrepancies, opinion has differed on whether animism refers to an ancestral mode of experience common to indigenous peoples around the world, or to a full-fledged religion in its own right. The currently accepted definition of animism was only developed in the late 19th century by Sir Edward Tylor, who created it as "one of anthropology's earliest concepts, if not the first".\u000aAnimism encompasses the beliefs that all material phenomena have agency, that there exists no hard and fast distinction between the spiritual and physical (or material) world and that soul or spirit or sentience exists not only in humans, but also in other animals, plants, rocks, geographic features such as mountains or rivers or other entities of the natural environment, including thunder, wind and shadows. Animism thus rejects Cartesian dualism. Animism may further attribute souls to abstract concepts such as words, true names or metaphors in mythology. Some members of the non-tribal world also consider themselves animists (such as author Daniel Quinn, sculptor Lawson Oyekan and many contemporary Pagans).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Theories ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Old animism ===\u000aEarlier anthropological perspectives, which have since been termed the "old animism", were concerned with knowledge on what is alive and what factors make something alive. The "old animism" assumed that animists were individuals who were unable to understand the difference between persons and things. Critics of the "old animism" have accused it of preserving "colonialist and dualist worldviews and rhetoric".\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Edward Tylor's definition ====\u000a\u000aThe idea of animism was developed by the anthropologist Sir Edward Tylor in his 1871 book Primitive Culture, in which he defined it as "the general doctrine of souls and other spiritual beings in general". According to Tylor, animism often includes "an idea of pervading life and will in nature"; a belief that natural objects other than humans have souls. That formulation was little different from that proposed by Auguste Comte as "fetishism", but the terms now have distinct meanings.\u000aFor Tylor, animism represented the earliest form of religion, being situated within an evolutionary framework of religion which has developed in stages and which will ultimately lead to humanity rejecting religion altogether in favor of scientific rationality. Thus, for Tylor, animism was fundamentally seen as a mistake, a basic error from which all religion grew. He did not believe that animism was inherently illogical, but he suggested that it arose from early humans' dreams and visions and thus was a rational system. However, it was based on erroneous, unscientific observations about the nature of reality. Stringer notes that his reading of Primitive Culture led him to believe that Tylor was far more sympathetic in regard to "primitive" populations than many of his contemporaries and that Tylor expressed no belief that there was any difference between the intellectual capabilities of "savage" people and Westerners.\u000aTylor had initially wanted to describe the phenomenon as "spiritualism" but realised that would cause confusion with the modern religion of Spiritualism, then was prevalent across Western nations. He adopted the term "animism" from the writings of the German scientist Georg Ernst Stahl, who, in 1708, had developed the term animismus as a biological theory that souls formed the vital principle and that the normal phenomena of life and the abnormal phenomena of disease could be traced to spiritual causes. The first known usage in English appeared in 1819.\u000aThe idea that there had once been "one universal form of primitive religion" (whether labelled "animism", "totemism", or "shamanism") has been dismissed as "unsophisticated" and "erroneous" by the archaeologist Timothy Insoll, who stated that "it removes complexity, a precondition of religion now, in all its variants".\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Social evolutionist conceptions ====\u000aTylor's definition of animism was a part of a growing international debate on the nature of "primitive society" by lawyers, theologians and philologists. The debate defined the field of research of a new science: anthropology. By the end of the 19th century, an orthodoxy on "primitive society" had emerged, but few anthropologists still would accept that definition. The "19th-century armchair anthropologists" argued "primitive society" (an evolutionary category) was ordered by kinship and was divided into exogamous descent groups related by a series of marriage exchanges. Their religion was animism, the belief that natural species and objects had souls. With the development of private property, the descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of "developed" religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced a society became, the fewer members of that society believed in animism. However, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented "survivals" of the original animism of early humanity.\u000a\u000aIn 1869 (three years after Tylor proposed his definition of animism), the Edinburgh lawyer, John Ferguson McLellan, argued that the animistic thinking evident in fetishism gave rise to a religion he named Totemism. Primitive people believed, he argued, that they were descended of the same species as their totemic animal. Subsequent debate by the 'armchair anthropologists' (including J. J. Bachofen, Émile Durkheim and Sigmund Freud) remained focused on totemism rather than animism, with few directly challenging Tylor's definition. Indeed, anthropologists "have commonly avoided the issue of Animism and even the term itself rather than revisit this prevalent notion in light of their new and rich ethnographies."\u000aAccording to the anthropologist Tim Ingold, animism shares similarities to totemism but differs in its focus on individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life, whereas totemism more typically holds that there is a primary source, such as the land itself or the ancestors, who provide the basis to life. Certain indigenous religious groups such as the Australian Aboriginals are more typically totemic, whereas others like the Inuit are more typically animistic in their worldview.\u000aFrom his studies into child development, Jean Piaget suggested that children were born with an innate animist worldview in which they anthropomorphized inanimate objects, and that it was only later that they grew out of this belief. Conversely, from her ethnographic research, Margaret Mead argued the opposite, believing that children were not born with an animist worldview but that they became acculturated to such beliefs as they were educated by their society. Stewart Guthrie saw animism \u2013 or "attribution" as he preferred it \u2013 as an evolutionary strategy to aid survival. He argued that both humans and other animal species view inanimate objects as potentially alive as a means of being constantly on guard against potential threats. His suggested explanation, however, did not deal with the question of why such a belief became central to religion.\u000aIn 2000, Guthrie suggested that the "most widespread" concept of animism was that it was the "attribution of spirits to natural phenomena such as stones and trees".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The new animism ===\u000aMany anthropologists ceased using the term "animism", deeming it to be too close to early anthropological theory and religious polemic. However, the term had also been claimed by religious groups \u2013 namely indigenous communities and nature worshipers \u2013 who felt that it aptly described their own beliefs, and who in some cases actively identified as "animists". It was thus readopted by various scholars, however they began using the term in a different way, placing the focus on knowing how to behave toward other persons, some of whom aren't human. As the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated, while the "old animist" definition had been problematic, the term "animism" was nevertheless "of considerable value as a critical, academic term for a style of religious and cultural relating to the world."\u000a\u000aThe "new animism" emerged largely from the publications of the anthropologist Irving Hallowell which were produced on the basis of his ethnographic research among the Ojibwe communities of Canada in the mid-20th century. For the Ojibwe encountered by Hallowell, personhood did not require human-likeness, but rather humans were perceived as being like other persons, who for instance included rock persons and bear persons. For the Ojibwe, these persons were each wilful beings who gained meaning and power through their interactions with others; through respectfully interacting with other persons, they themselves learned to "act as a person". Hallowell's approach to the understanding of Ojibwe personhood differed strongly from prior anthropological concepts of animism. He emphasized the need to challenge the modernist, Western perspectives of what a person is by entering into a dialogue with different worldwide-views.\u000aHallowell's approach influenced the work of anthropologist Nurit Bird-David, who produced a scholarly article reassessing the idea of animism in 1999. Seven comments from other academics were provided in the journal, debating Bird-David's ideas.\u000aMore recently post-modern anthropologists are increasingly engaging with the concept of animism. Modernism is characterized by a Cartesian subject-object dualism that divides the subjective from the objective, and culture from nature; in this view, Animism is the inverse of scientism, and hence inherently invalid. Drawing on the work of Bruno Latour, these anthropologists question these modernist assumptions, and theorize that all societies continue to "animate" the world around them, and not just as a Tylorian survival of primitive thought. Rather, the instrumental reason characteristic of modernity is limited to our "professional subcultures," which allows us to treat the world as a detached mechanical object in a delimited sphere of activity. We, like animists, also continue to create personal relationships with elements of the so-called objective world, whether pets, cars or teddy-bears, who we recognize as subjects. As such, these entities are "approached as communicative subjects rather than the inert objects perceived by modernists." These approaches are careful to avoid the modernist assumptions that the environment consists dichotomously of a physical world distinct from humans, and from modernist conceptions of the person as composed dualistically as body and soul.\u000aNurit Bird-David argues that "Positivistic ideas about the meaning of 'nature', 'life' and 'personhood' misdirected these previous attempts to understand the local concepts. Classical theoreticians (it is argued) attributed their own modernist ideas of self to 'primitive peoples' while asserting that the 'primitive peoples' read their idea of self into others!" She argues that animism is a "relational epistemology", and not a Tylorian failure of primitive reasoning. That is, self-identity among animists is based on their relationships with others, rather than some distinctive feature of the self. Instead of focusing on the essentialized, modernist self (the "individual"), persons are viewed as bundles of social relationships ("dividuals"), some of which are with "superpersons" (i.e. non-humans).\u000aGuthrie expressed criticism of Bird-David's attitude toward animism, believing that it promulgated the view that "the world is in large measure whatever our local imagination makes it". This, he felt, would result in anthropology abandoning "the scientific project".\u000aTim Ingold, like Bird-David, argues that animists do not see themselves as separate from their environment: "Hunter-gatherers do not, as a rule, approach their environment as an external world of nature that has to be 'grasped' intellectually ... indeed the separation of mind and nature has no place in their thought and practice." Willerslev extends the argument by noting that animists reject this Cartesian dualism, and that the animist self identifies with the world, "feeling at once within and apart from it so that the two glide ceaselessly in and out of each other in a sealed circuit." The animist hunter is thus aware of himself as a human hunter, but, through mimicry is able to assume the viewpoint, senses, and sensibilities of his prey, to be one with it. Shamanism, in this view, is an everyday attempt to influence spirits of ancestors and animals by mirroring their behaviours as the hunter does his prey.\u000aCultural ecologist and philosopher David Abram articulates and elaborates an intensely ethical and ecological form of animism grounded in the phenomenology of sensory experience. In his books Becoming Animal and The Spell of the Sensuous, Abram suggests that material things are never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that perceived things actively "solicit our attention" or "call our focus," coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science, as well as upon the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it would draw us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain, enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us. In contrast to a long-standing tendency in the Western social sciences, which commonly provide rational explanations of animistic experience, Abram develops an animistic account of reason itself. He holds that civilized reason is sustained only by an intensely animistic participation between human beings and their own written signs. Indeed, as soon as we turn our gaze toward the alphabetic letters written on a page or a screen, these letters speak to us\u2014we 'see what they say'\u2014much as ancient trees and gushing streams and lichen-encrusted boulders once spoke to our oral ancestors. Hence reading is an intensely concentrated form of animism, one that effectively eclipses all of the other, older, more spontaneous forms of participation in which we once engaged. "To tell the story in this manner\u2014to provide an animistic account of reason, rather than the other way around\u2014is to imply that animism is the wider and more inclusive term, and that oral, mimetic modes of experience still underlie, and support, all our literate and technological modes of reflection. When reflection's rootedness in such bodily, participatory modes of experience is entirely unacknowledged or unconscious, reflective reason becomes dysfunctional, unintentionally destroying the corporeal, sensuous world that sustains it."\u000aThe religious studies scholar Graham Harvey defined animism as the belief "that the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human, and that life is always lived in relationship with others". He added that it is therefore "concerned with learning how to be a good person in respectful relationships with other persons". Graham Harvey, in his 2013 Handbook of Contemporary Animism, identifies the animist perspective in line with Martin Buber's "I-thou" as opposed to "I-it". In such, Harvey says, the Animist takes an I-thou approach to relating to his world, where objects and animals are treated as a "thou" rather than as an "it".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Religion ==\u000a\u000aThere is ongoing disagreement (and no general consensus) as to whether animism is merely a singular, broadly encompassing religious belief or a worldview in and of itself, comprising many diverse mythologies found worldwide in many diverse cultures. This also raises a controversy regarding the ethical claims animism may or may not make: whether animism ignores questions of ethics altogether or, by endowing various non-human elements of nature with spirituality or personhood, in fact promotes a complex ecological ethics.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Fetishism/totemism ===\u000a\u000aIn many animistic world views, the human being is often regarded as on a roughly equal footing with other animals, plants, and natural forces.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Shamanism ===\u000a\u000aA shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits, who typically enters into a trance state during a ritual, and practices divination and healing. According to Mircea Eliade, shamanism encompasses the premise that shamans are intermediaries or messengers between the human world and the spirit worlds. Shamans are said to treat ailments/illness by mending the soul. Alleviating traumas affecting the soul/spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness. The shaman also enters supernatural realms or dimensions to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community. Shamans may visit other worlds/dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements. The shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world, which in turn affects the human world. The restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment. Abram, however, articulates a less supernatural and much more ecological understanding of the shaman's role than that propounded by Eliade. Drawing upon his own field research in Indonesia, Nepal, and the Americas, Abram suggests that in animistic cultures, the shaman functions primarily as an intermediary between the human community and the more-than-human community of active agencies \u2014 the local animals, plants, and landforms (mountains, rivers, forests, winds and weather patterns, all of whom are felt to have their own specific sentience). Hence the shaman's ability to heal individual instances of dis-ease (or imbalance) within the human community is a by-product of her/his more continual practice of balancing the reciprocity between the human community and the wider collective of animate beings in which that community is embedded.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Distinction from pantheism ===\u000aAnimism is not the same as pantheism, although the two are sometimes confused. Some religions are both pantheistic and animistic. One of the main differences is that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united (monism), the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits and/or souls.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Examples ===\u000aMun, (also called Munism or Bongthingism) is the traditional polytheistic, animist, shamanistic, and syncretic religion of the Lepcha people.\u000aThe New Age movement commonly demonstrates animistic traits in asserting the existence of nature spirits.\u000aSome Neopagan groups, including Eco-Pagans, describe themselves as animists, meaning that they respect the diverse community of living beings and spirits with whom humans share the world/cosmos.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Animist life ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Animals, plants, and the elements ===\u000aAnimism entails the belief that "all living things have a soul", and thus a central concern of animist thought surrounds how animals can be eaten or otherwise used for humans' subsistence needs. The actions of non-human animals are viewed as "intentional, planned and purposive", and they are understood to be persons because they are both alive and communicate with others. In animist world-views, non-human animals are understood to participate in kinship systems and ceremonies with humans, as well as having their own kinship systems and ceremonies. Harvey cited an example of an animist understanding of animal behaviour that occurred at a powwow held by the Conne River Mi'kmaq in 1996; an eagle flew over the proceedings, circling over the central drum group. The assembled participants called out kitpu ("eagle"), conveying welcome to the bird and expressing pleasure at its beauty, and they later articulated the view that the eagle's actions reflected its approval of the event and the Mi'kmaq's return to traditional spiritual practices.\u000aSome animists also view plant and fungi life as persons and interact with them accordingly. The most common encounter between humans and these plant and fungi persons is with the former's collection of the latter for food, and for animists this interaction typically has to be carried out respectfully. Harvey cited the example of Maori communities in New Zealand, who often offer karakia invocations to sweet potatoes as they dig the latter up; while doing so there is an awareness of a kinship relationship between the Maori and the sweet potatoes, with both understood as having arrived in Aotearoa together in the same canoes. In other instances, animists believe that interaction with plant and fungi persons can result in the communication of things unknown or even otherwise unknowable. Among some modern Pagans, for instance, relationships are cultivated with specific trees, who are understood to bestow knowledge or physical gifts, such as flowers, sap, or wood that can be used as firewood or to fashion into a wand; in return, these Pagans give offerings to the tree itself, which can come in the form of libations of mead or ale, a drop of blood from a finger, or a strand of wool.\u000aVarious animistic cultures also comprehend as stones as persons. Discussing ethnographic work conducted among the Ojibwe, Harvey noted that their society generally conceived of stones as being inanimate, but with two notable exceptions: the stones of the Bell Rocks and those stones which are situated beneath trees struck by lightning, which were understood to have become Thunderers themselves. The Ojibwe conceived of weather as being capable of having personhood, with storms being conceived of as persons known as 'Thunderers' whose sounds conveyed communications and who engaged in seasonal conflict over the lakes and forests, throwing lightning at lake monsters. Wind, similarly, can be conceived as a person in animistic thought.\u000aThe importance of place is also a recurring element of animism, with some places being understood to be persons in their own right.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Spirits ===\u000aAnimism can also entail relationships being established with non-corporeal spirit entities.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other usages ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Science and animism ===\u000aIn the early 20th century, William McDougall defended a form of Animism in his book Body and Mind: A History and Defence of Animism (1911).\u000aThe physicist Nick Herbert has argued for "quantum animism" in which mind permeates the world at every level.\u000a\u000aThe quantum consciousness assumption, which amounts to a kind of "quantum animism" likewise asserts that consciousness is an integral part of the physical world, not an emergent property of special biological or computational systems. Since everything in the world is on some level a quantum system, this assumption requires that everything be conscious on that level. If the world is truly quantum animated, then there is an immense amount of invisible inner experience going on all around us that is presently inaccessible to humans, because our own inner lives are imprisoned inside a small quantum system, isolated deep in the meat of an animal brain.\u000a\u000aWerner Krieglstein wrote regarding his quantum Animism:\u000a\u000aHerbert's quantum Animism differs from traditional Animism in that it avoids assuming a dualistic model of mind and matter. Traditional dualism assumes that some kind of spirit inhabits a body and makes it move, a ghost in the machine. Herbert's quantum Animism presents the idea that every natural system has an inner life, a conscious center, from which it directs and observes its action.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Socio-political impact ===\u000aHarvey opined that animism's views on personhood represented a radical challenge to the dominant perspectives of modernity, because it accords "intelligence, rationality, consciousness, volition, agency, intentionality, language and desire" to non-humans. Similarly, it challenges the view of human uniqueness that is prevalent in both Abrahamic religions and Western rationalism.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== In art and literature ===\u000aAnimist beliefs can also be expressed through artwork. For instance, among the Maori communities of New Zealand, there is an acknowledgment that creating art through carving wood or stone entails violence against the wood or stone person, and that the persons who are damaged therefore have to be placated and respected during the process; any excess or waste from the creation of the artwork is returned to the land, while the artwork itself is treated with particular respect. Harvey therefore argued that the creation of art among the Maori was not about creating an inanimate object for display, but rather a transformation of different persons within a relationship.\u000aHarvey expressed the view that animist worldviews were present in various works of literature, citing such examples as the writings of Alan Garner, Leslie Silko, Barbara Kingsolver, Alice Walker, Daniel Quinn, Linda Hogan, David Abram, Patricia Grace, Chinua Achebe, Ursula Le Guin, Louise Erdrich, and Marge Piercy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aAnecdotal cognitivism\u000aAnimatism\u000aEcotheology\u000aFolk religion\u000aHylozoism\u000aMana\u000aNature worship\u000aPanpsychism\u000aReligion and environmentalism\u000aSacred trees\u000aWildlife totemization\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aAbram, David (1996).

aVHow Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? is a British reality television talent show that documented the search for an undiscovered musical theatre performer to play the role of Maria von Trapp in the 2006 Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Ian stage production of The Sound of Music.\u000aThe series was originally devised by the then in-house development team at BBC Entertainment Events and was announced by the BBC in April 2006. BBC One broadcast the programme, which was hosted by Graham Norton, on Saturday evenings from 29 July through 16 September 2006.\u000aThe title derives from the refrain of "Maria", a song from the first act of The Sound of Music.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Format ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Creation ===\u000aThe lead role of Maria von Trapp in the new West End production of The Sound of Music, to be staged by Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Ian, was to be played by American actress Scarlett Johansson. Negotiations fell through, and after a four-year search for an actress to fill the role, it was revealed in November 2005 that Lloyd Webber had approached the BBC to allow the public to cast the role through a Popstars-style talent search, the first time that such a format had been used.\u000aThis was the first programme to allow the public to cast a leading role in a West End show, and it was initially criticised. However, it won International Emmy and Royal Television Society awards and became the first of a series of collaborations between the BBC and Lloyd Webber, including Any Dream Will Do, I'd Do Anything, and Over the Rainbow. The series also led to versions and similar series abroad.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Expert panel ===\u000a\u000aTo assess and train the potential Marias and judge them during the live shows, an expert panel was chosen. The panel comprised:\u000aAndrew Lloyd Webber \u2013 musical theatre composer and producer, co-producer of the new stage production\u000aDavid Ian \u2013 theatre producer, co-producer of the new stage production\u000aJohn Barrowman \u2013 musical performer, dancer, singer and actor\u000aZoe Tyler \u2013 voice coach, singer and performer, vocal coach to the finalists\u000aLloyd Webber also asked Denise van Outen to participate in the series, but she turned him down, saying that she "felt uncomfortable about being on the panel and giving my criticism". She later became a judge on follow-up series, Any Dream Will Do.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Auditions ===\u000aOpen auditions were held around the UK in April and May 2006, open to both professionals and amateurs over the age of 17. The top 200 made it through to the London callbacks where they performed for Ian, Barrowman and Tyler to secure one of 50 places at Lloyd Webber's "Maria School", where over four days they would receive vocal and drama training from the expert panel.\u000aSeveral additional performers were selected over this fifty contestant limit; one being Briony, who had been rejected initially due to nerves hampering her performance, but who returned for a second chance and was allowed in by Ian. A further four, whom the panel had rejected, were contacted by Lloyd Webber himself as he personally believed them to be potential Marias.\u000aDuring "Maria School", contestants were eliminated to leave twenty, who were then taken to Lloyd Webber's house, where they performed for fifty people from the entertainment business. Ten finalists were then chosen by the panel and taken through to the live studio finals.\u000aThe series started on Saturday 29 July 2006, and the first two programmes followed the audition stages of the competition before revealing the final ten at the end of the second programme.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Live finals ===\u000aThe final ten contestants then competed in the live studio finals held on Saturday nights over six weeks. Each week the contestants sang and performed during the live show, receiving comments from the judges following their performance. The public then got a chance to vote for their favourite Maria, and the two contestants with the fewest votes performed a sing-off in front of Lloyd Webber, who then decided which Maria to keep in the contest. This was repeated with the top ten, the top nine and the top eight. With the top seven and top five, two were voted off in the program, and there were two different sing-offs.\u000aLloyd Webber had no say in the final casting decision, when in the concluding edition of the series it was left to the public to choose who should play Maria out of the final two contenders, Connie Fisher and Helena Blackman. After more than 2 million votes were cast, the winning entrant was revealed as Fisher, who won a six-month contract to play Maria in the West End production, performing six out of the eight weekly shows.\u000aThe profits from the telephone votes went to a bursary for young performers. Lloyd Webber also donated his fee to the bursary.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Finalists ==\u000aTen potential Marias were selected as finalists who would appear on the live shows. Abi Finley and Aoife Mulholland auditioned together having known each other from college, and both made it to the finals. One of the original 10 finalists, Emilie Alford, withdrew from the competition after deciding it was not for her. She was replaced by Siobhan Dillon, who lost a place in the final ten following a sing-off against Alford and Laura Sicurello in front of Lloyd Webber. This earned her the nickname "Second Chance Maria".\u000a*As of start of series\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Results summary ===\u000aColour key\u000a\u000a\u000a== Live shows ==\u000aThe live shows saw the finalists eliminated one by one following both individual and group performances. Once eliminated, the leaving contestant ended the programme by leading a performance of "So Long, Farewell" from The Sound of Music with the remaining contestants.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Week 1 ===\u000aFollowing the first week of competition.

The mission was a fitness test, with Olympic athlete Iwan Thomas, requiring the Marias to complete an assault course. The Marias also attended the première of the film You, Me and Dupree in Leicester Square.\u000aThe show performances were:\u000aGroup performances:\u000a"The Lonely Goatherd" (from The Sound of Music)\u000a"Don't Stop Me Now" (Queen)\u000a\u000aSing-off:\u000aHelena Blackman and Meliz Serman were in the sing-off, and performed "Take That Look Off Your Face" from Tell Me on a Sunday.\u000aLloyd Webber chose to save Helena and bid farewell to Meliz.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Week 4 ===\u000aAhead of Saturday night, Lloyd Webber made a surprise visit to the contestants and worked with each to improve their performance.

(from The Sound of Music)\u000aConnie and Helena: "The Sound of Music" (from The Sound of Music)\u000aFormer Marias: "Edelweiss" (from The Sound of Music)\u000a\u000aAfter being announced as the series winner, Connie concluded the series with a performance of "The Sound of Music".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Winner ==\u000aFollowing a public telephone vote, 23-year-old Connie Fisher was chosen as Maria and performed the role in the West End from November 2006 to February 2008. The series also helped the careers of the other finalists, some of whom later took leading roles in West End shows. Semi-finalist Aoife Mulholland also took up the role of Maria in April 2007 for two shows a week, after Fisher was advised to reduce her performances to six per week.\u000a\u000a\u000a== After the series ==\u000aFollowing the final, Lloyd Webber was criticised after it was revealed that actress Emma Williams had been hired to perform the two performances per week that Fisher would not. Prior to The Sound of Music opening Williams "withdrew her services", reportedly because her role had been downgraded from four shows per week to two, leaving Fisher to perform all eight shows unless indisposed.\u000aWith £10 million in advance ticket sales, the £4 million production opened at the London Palladium on 15 November 2006 to positive reviews, leading to a £1.1 million increase in ticket sales in one day. In January 2007, Fisher was chosen by the London Critics' Circle to win their award for best newcomer, sharing the prize with Andrew Garfield. Reducing her performances to six per week in March 2007 following an order to rest her voice, her run in the show was extended until 23 February 2008, when actress Summer Strallen took over the role following a tie-in with the Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks. Fisher has also made numerous appearances on stage and on television, released two albums, and performed the lead role in the ITV1 drama Caught in a Trap on 26 December 2008. She reprised her role as Maria in a UK tour of the production in July 2009.\u000aSeveral of the other final ten contestants have taken on leading roles in musicals following the series. Aoife Mulholland was cast in December 2006 as Roxie Hart in the West End musical Chicago, and took on the role of Maria in the West End production for two shows per week in April 2007 after Fisher's reduction in performances. In July 2007 Siobhan Dillon started in the role of Patty Simcox in the musical Grease and later went on to play the lead role of Sandy in January 2010. Fellow finalist Helena Blackman played Nellie Forbush in a UK tour of South Pacific. Mulholland originated the role of Brooke Wyndham in the West End production of Legally Blonde, and Dillon took over the role of Vivienne Kensington in October 2010.\u000aA follow-up programme How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? \u2013 Connie's Story aired on 27 December 2006 and followed Fisher during rehearsals for her new role up to and including the opening night. Fisher and several other finalists appeared in a special programme on 24 December 2007 with the winner and finalists from Any Dream Will Do titled When Joseph Met Maria.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reception ==\u000aLloyd Webber was initially criticised for wanting to cast the role through a television talent search, and he and the BBC were also criticised by the actors union Equity. They stated that they believed their members would find the series "demeaning to their profession" and that it was not a "proper way" to choose a performer.\u000aThe series opened to mostly negative reviews from the press, with the Daily Mail stating that the series was a "trainwreck". In response to the criticism, Lloyd Webber told The Times:\u000a\u000a"This programme is providing a platform for musical theatre that it has never had before. The only people upset with Maria are a few precious luvvies who think things should be done a certain way."\u000a\u000aLloyd Webber and the BBC were also criticised for giving the production "11 hours of free publicity on prime-time television" and that the series could be "considered commercial advertising". The BBC Trust's Editorial Standards Committee disagreed, saying that the corporation retained "editorial control of the programme" and avoided "disproportionate prominence for Lloyd Webber and the production".\u000aThe first programme attracted 5.1 million viewers with a 32% audience share, with 4.9 million viewers (30% share) watching the first of the live finals, and 4.7 million (23% share) viewing the results programme. The series dropped to a low of 4.4 million viewers (24% share) against the third series of The X Factor on ITV1, which started the week before. The X Factor continued to gain higher viewing figures as the weeks progressed, with the final of Maria? attracting 5.5 million viewers (28% share) for the main show and 7.7 million (35% share) for the results show.\u000aFollowing the conclusion of the series on a ratings high and positive reviews for Fisher following her opening night, the series was followed by a number of similar series from both the BBC and other broadcasters in the UK and abroad. It was credited with helping London theatres reach record ticket sales and attendances in 2007 and, according to The Independent, for "persuading a new, younger audience to see the shows in the flesh".\u000aThe series was shown on BBC America in the United States from June 2009. It was described as being "refreshing in its simplicity" in a "landscape that lately seems dominated by audition-heavy musical competitions" by LA Times critic Mary McNamara, but Brian Lowry of Variety didn't feel that it would be successful in the U.S.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Awards ===\u000aThe series won three awards, and received nominations for another two:\u000a2007 International Emmy Awards: winner \u2013 non-scripted entertainment\u000a2006 Royal Television Society Awards: winner \u2013 best entertainment programme\u000a2007 Broadcast Awards: winner \u2013 best entertainment programme\u000a2007 British Academy Television Awards: nominated \u2013 best entertainment programme\u000a2007 Broadcasting Press Guild Awards: nominated \u2013 best comedy/entertainment\u000a\u000a\u000a== Ratings ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Follow-up and international series ==\u000aThe success of the series led to its becoming the first in a series of West End themed talent contests produced by the BBC in collaboration with Lloyd Webber. 2007 saw Any Dream Will Do search for a new male lead to play Joseph for a production of Lloyd Webber's and Tim Rice's Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. This was followed in 2008 by I'd Do Anything, which sought a lead to play Nancy and three young performers to play the lead in a production of the musical Oliver!. In 2010, Over the Rainbow cast Dorothy and a dog to play Toto in the forthcoming stage production of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. The BBC also collaborated with Lloyd Webber to find a performer for Britain's entry into the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 through Eurovision: Your Country Needs You.\u000aOn 20 August 2006, it was reported that Lloyd Webber had taken legal action against David Ian. Lloyd Webber reportedly wanted to take the format to the United States to cast a Broadway theatre production of Grease. Lloyd Webber discovered that Ian had already brought the idea to NBC, who announced they will look for unknowns to play Sandy Dumbrowski and Danny Zuko, via reality TV show Grease: You're the One that I Want! with Ian and BBC Worldwide, leaving Lloyd Webber furious. Ian said "I don't understand the problem. Andrew has no connection with the stage show Grease, which I have successfully produced in the UK. There is a new production of Grease on Broadway in the spring of 2007, that's why I've been asked to judge on You're The One That We Want." This was followed in the UK with the ITV1 series Grease Is the Word, with Ian as a judge. It aired against Any Dream Will Do in 2007.\u000aOp zoek naar Evita (Looking for Evita) was produced in the Netherlands in 2007, followed by Op zoek naar Joseph (Looking for Joseph) in 2008, Op zoek naar Mary Poppins (Looking for Mary Poppins) in 2009 and Op zoek naar Zorro (Looking for Zorro) in 2011 and even Op zoek naar Annie (Looking for Annie) in 2012.\u000aIn 2008 a Canadian version of the show with the same title, searched for a Maria for an upcoming Toronto production of The Sound of Music; this show was initiated by Lloyd Webber, and was aired on CBC Television.\u000aIn 2009 Vtm aired a Flemish version titled Op zoek naar Maria (Looking for Maria).\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aHow Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? at BBC Online\u000aHow Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? on IMDb

aVDerek Jefferson (born 5 September 1948 in Morpeth, Northumberland) is an English former professional footballer. During his career he made over 150 appearances for Ipswich Town between 1966 and 1972, where he was nicknamed 'Chopper'.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aJefferson joined Ipswich Town as a youth trainee, before making his senior debut on 28 January 1967 in a 4-1 win over Shrewsbury Town in the FA Cup. Although this was his only appearance in the 1966\u201367 season, he broke into the first team in the following campaign and was a regular as the club won the Second Division Championship.\u000aAfter a further four full seasons in the top flight at Portman Road, he moved to fellow Division One club Wolves in October 1972. He immediately made his debut in a 1-1 draw at Manchester City on 7 October and went on to make 24 appearances that season. However, this proved his highest seasonal tally for the Midlanders, as he never became a first choice player, managing 52 appearances in total for the club spread over four years.\u000aWolves allowed Jefferson to compete in the North American Soccer League in the summer of 1976, and later loaned him out to Sheffield Wednesday during October 1976. The following month, he left Molineux for good when he joined Hereford United, playing in the second tier for the only time in their history. (His son Christopher currently plays for the Hereford-based non-league club Westfields).\u000aAfter finishing his playing career, Jefferson became Reserve Team manager at Birmingham City under Jim Smith. He left after five years at this post to devote himself to Christian work, which he is still involved with, acting as a sports coach in a church-affiliated program in Solihull. A few years after he left Birmingham, he stated "I left Birmingham city to move onto bigger and better things. There was no ambition at the club, they had no money, there was no future.

aVPostmodern International relations is an approach that has been part of international relations scholarship since the 1980s. Although there are various strands of thinking, a key element to postmodernist theories is a distrust of any account of human life which claims to have direct access to the "truth". Post-modern international relations theory critiques theories like Marxism that provide an overarching metanarrative to history. Key postmodern thinkers include Lyotard, Foucault and Derrida.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Criticisms ==\u000aA criticism made of post-modern approaches to international relations is that they place too much emphasis on theoretical notions and are generally not concerned with the empirical evidence.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aBibliography of books and articles

aVHot Springs is the eleventh-largest city in the state of Arkansas and the county seat of Garland County. The city is located in the Ouachita Mountains among the U.S. Interior Highlands, and is set among several natural hot springs for which the city is named. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 35,193. In 2015 the estimated population was 35,635.\u000aThe center of Hot Springs is the oldest federal reserve in the United States, today preserved as Hot Springs National Park. The hot spring water has been popularly believed for centuries to possess medicinal properties, and was a subject of legend among several Native American tribes. Following federal protection in 1832, the city developed into a successful spa town. Incorporated January 10, 1851, the city has been home to Major League Baseball spring training, illegal gambling, speakeasies and gangsters such as Al Capone, horse racing at Oaklawn Park, the Army and Navy Hospital, and 42nd President Bill Clinton. One of the largest Pentecostal denominations in the United States, the Assemblies of God, traces its beginnings to Hot Springs.\u000aToday, much of Hot Springs's history is preserved by various government entities. Hot Springs National Park is maintained by the National Park Service, including Bathhouse Row, which preserves the eight historic bathhouse buildings and gardens along Central Avenue. Downtown Hot Springs is preserved as the Central Avenue Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The city also contains dozens of historic hotels and motor courts, built during the Great Depression in the Art Deco style. Due to the popularity of the thermal waters, Hot Springs benefited from rapid growth during a period when many cities saw a sharp decline in building; much like Miami's art deco districts. As a result, Hot Springs's architecture is a key part of the city's blend of cultures, including a reputation as a tourist town and a Southern city. Also a destination for the arts, Hot Springs features the Hot Springs Music Festival, Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival, and the Valley of the Vapors Independent Music Festival annually.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Discovery and settlement ===\u000aMembers of many Native American tribes had been gathering in the valley for untold numbers of years to enjoy the healing properties of the thermal springs.\u000aIn 1673, Father Marquette and Jolliet explored the area and claimed it for France. The 1763 Treaty of Paris ceded the land to Spain; however, in 1800 control was returned to France until the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.\u000aIn December 1804, Dr. George Hunter and William Dunbar made an expedition to the springs, finding a lone log cabin and a few rudimentary shelters used by people visiting the springs for their healing properties. In 1807, a man named Prudhomme became the first settler of modern Hot Springs, and he was soon joined by John Perciful and Isaac Cates.\u000aOn August 24, 1818, the Quapaw Indians ceded the land around the hot springs to the United States in a treaty. After Arkansas became its own territory in 1819, the Arkansas Territorial Legislature requested in 1820 that the springs and adjoining mountains be set aside as a federal reservation. Twelve years later, in 1832, the Hot Springs Reservation was created by the United States Congress, granting federal protection of the thermal waters. The reservation was renamed Hot Springs National Park in 1921.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Civil War ===\u000aThe outbreak of the American Civil War left Hot Springs with a declining bathing population. After the Confederate forces suffered defeat in the Battle of Pea Ridge in March 1862, the Union troops advanced toward the Confederate city of Little Rock. Confederate Governor Henry M. Rector moved his staff and state records to Hot Springs. Union forces did not attack Little Rock, and the government returned to the capital city on July 14, 1862.\u000aMany residents of Hot Springs fled to Texas or Louisiana and remained there until the end of the war. In September 1863, Union forces occupied Little Rock. During this period, Hot Springs became the prey of guerrilla bands loosely associated with either Union or Confederate forces. They pillaged and burned the near-deserted town, leaving only a few buildings standing at the end of the Civil War.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Rebuilding ===\u000aAfter the Civil War, an extensive rebuilding of bathhouses and hotels took place at Hot Springs. The year-round population soared to 1,200 inhabitants by 1870. By 1873 six bathhouses and 24 hotels and boardinghouses stood near the springs. In 1874, Joseph Reynolds announced his decision to construct a narrow-gauge railroad from Malvern to Hot Springs; completion in 1875 resulted in the growth of visitation to the springs. Samuel W. Fordyce and two other entrepreneurs financed the construction of the first luxury hotel in the area, the first Arlington Hotel, which opened in 1875.\u000aDuring the Reconstruction Era, several conflicting land claims reached the U.S. Congress and resulted in an April 24, 1876, Supreme Court ruling that the land title of Hot Springs belonged to the federal government. Protests ensued. To deal with the situation, Congress formed the Hot Springs Commission to lay out streets in the town of Hot Springs, deal with land claims, define property lines, condemn buildings illegally on the permanent reservation (now the national park) and define a process for claimants to purchase land. The commission surveyed and set aside 264.93 acres (1.0721 km2) encompassing the hot springs and Hot Springs Mountain to be a permanent government reservation. Another 1,200 acres (4.9 km2) became the Hot Springs townsite, with 700 acres (2.8 km2) awarded to claimants. The townsite consisted of 196 blocks and 50 miles (80 km) of streets and alleys. The remaining portion of the original four sections of government land consisted of hills and mountains which were mostly unoccupied, and Congress acted on the commission's recommendation in June 1880 by adding those lands to the permanent reservation.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Baseball in Hot Springs ===\u000aHot Springs has a rich baseball history. During the early 20th century (1894\u20131925), Hot Springs was known for baseball training camps after the construction of Whittington Park in 1894. Many Major League clubs brought their teams to Hot Springs to get the players in shape for the coming season. The Cleveland Spiders, Pittsburgh Pirates, Brooklyn Dodgers, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox were among the teams that made Hot Springs their home base. It is documented that well over 100 members of the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame trained in Hot Springs. Legendary Babe Ruth once hit a 578-foot home run that landed in the Arkansas Alligator Farm and Petting Zoo, and he could be seen walking the streets, visiting the bath spas, and gambling at the nearby horse track.\u000aToday there are 26 markers posted throughout Hot Springs on the "Hot Springs Baseball Historic Trail" that identify key people and locations.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1913 fire ===\u000a\u000aOn September 6, 1913, a fire broke out on Church Street a few blocks southeast of Bathhouse Row, near the Army and Navy Hospital. The fire burned southeast, away from the hospital, until the wind reversed an hour later. Racing toward the business section, it destroyed the Ozark Sanitarium and Hot Springs High School on its way across Malvern Avenue. Along the way it consumed the Public Utilities plant, which destroyed the firefighters' water supply. A wide front then was blown toward Ouachita Avenue which destroyed the Garland County Court House. The Hot Springs Fire Department fought alongside the Little Rock Fire Department, which had rushed over on a special train. Despite their efforts, numerous homes, at least a hundred businesses, four hotels, the Iron Mountain Railroad facilities, and the Crystal Theater were destroyed. A rainstorm finally quenched the blaze at Hazel Street. Although Central Avenue was ultimately protected (primarily by desperate use of dynamite), much of the southern part of the city was destroyed. Damage was estimated at $10,000,000 across 60 blocks.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Formation of the Assemblies of God ===\u000aFrom April 2\u201312, 1914 several Pentecostal Christian leaders gathered in Hot Springs to form what became known as the Assemblies of God. It has since grown to become one of the largest Pentecostal denominations in the United States, with 3,146,741 adherents, 12,849 churches, and 36,884 ministers (as of 2014).\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Gangsters and illegal gambling ===\u000a\u000aIllegal gambling became firmly established in Hot Springs during the decades following the Civil War, with two factions, the Flynns and the Dorans, fighting one another throughout the 1880s for control of the town. Frank Flynn, leader of the Flynn Faction, had effectively begun paying local law enforcement officers employed by both the Hot Springs Police Department and the Garland County Sheriff's Office to collect unpaid debts, as well as to intimidate gambling rivals. This contributed to the March 16, 1899, Hot Springs Gunfight. Of the seven Hot Springs police officers that have been killed while in service of the department, three died during that gunfight, killed by deputies of the Garland County Sheriff's Office. One part-time deputy sheriff was killed also, by the Hot Springs officers.\u000aAlong with Bathhouse Row, one of downtown Hot Springs' most noted landmarks is the Arlington Hotel, a favored retreat for Al Capone.\u000aHot Springs eventually became a national gambling mecca, led by Owney Madden and his Hotel Arkansas casino. The period 1927\u20131947 was its wagering pinnacle, with no fewer than ten major casinos and numerous smaller houses running wide open, the largest such operation in the United States at the time. Hotels advertised the availability of prostitutes, and off-track booking was available for virtually any horse race in North America.\u000aLocal law enforcement was controlled by a political machine run by long-serving mayor Leo P. McLaughlin. The McLaughlin organization purchased hundreds of poll tax receipts, many in the names of deceased or fictitious persons, which would sometimes be voted in different precincts. A former sheriff, who attempted to have the state's anti-gambling laws enforced and to secure honest elections, was murdered in 1937. No one was ever charged with his killing. Machine domination of city and county government was abruptly ended in 1946 with the election of a "Government Improvement" slate of returning World War II veterans led by Marine Lt. Col. Sid McMath, who was elected prosecuting attorney. A 1947 grand jury indicted several owners and promoters, as well as McLaughlin, for public servant bribery. Although the former mayor and most of the others were acquitted, the machine's power was broken and gambling came to a halt, as McMath led a statewide "GI Revolt" into the governor's office in 1948. Illegal casino gambling resumed, however, with the election of Orval Faubus as governor in 1954. Buoyed into 12 years in office by his popular defiance of federal court desegregation orders, Faubus turned a blind eye to gambling in Hot Springs.\u000aGambling was finally closed down permanently in 1967 by two Republican officeholders, Governor Winthrop Rockefeller and Circuit Judge Henry M. Britt. Rockefeller sent in a company of state troopers to shutter the casinos and burn their gaming equipment. Until other forms of gambling became legal in Arkansas four decades later, Oaklawn Park, a thoroughbred horse racing track south of downtown, was the only legal gambling establishment in Hot Springs and one of only two in the state of Arkansas; the other was the Southland Greyhound Park dog track in West Memphis. Both Oaklawn and Southland remain in operation.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== World War II ===\u000a\u000aThe military took over the enormous Eastman Hotel across the street from the Army and Navy Hospital in 1942 because the hospital was not nearly large enough to hold the sick and wounded coming in. In 1944, the Army began redeploying returning overseas soldiers; officials inspected hotels in 20 cities before selecting Hot Springs as a redistribution center for returning soldiers. In August 1944 the Army took over most of the hotels in Hot Springs. The soldiers from the west-central states received a 21-day furlough before reporting to the redistribution station. They spent 14 days updating their military records and obtaining physical and dental treatment. The soldiers had time to enjoy the baths at a reduced rate and other recreational activities. The redistribution center closed down in December 1945 after processing more than 32,000 members of the military. In 1946, after the war, the Eastman was demolished when the federal government no longer needed it.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 21st century ===\u000aIn 2013, the metro was ranked by Forbes as one of the top "small places for business and careers", citing a low cost of doing business, high job growth and an educated workforce.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geography ==\u000a\u000aHot Springs is located in southeastern Garland County at 34°29\u203250\u2033N 93°03\u203219\u2033W. It sits at the southeastern edge of the Ouachita Mountains and is 55 miles (89 km) southwest of Little Rock.\u000aAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Hot Springs has a total area of 35.1 square miles (91.0 km2), of which 35.0 square miles (90.7 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.3 km2), or 0.35%, is water.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Natural springs ===\u000aThe city takes its name from the natural thermal water that flows from 47 springs on the western slope of Hot Springs Mountain in the historic downtown district of the city. About 1,000,000 US gallons (3,800,000 L) of 143 °F (62 °C) flow from the springs each day. The flow rate is not affected by fluctuations in the rainfall in the area. Studies by National Park Service scientists have determined through radiocarbon dating that the water that reaches the surface in Hot Springs fell as rainfall 4,400 years earlier. The water percolates very slowly down through the earth's surface until it reaches superheated areas deep in the crust and then rushes rapidly to the surface to emerge from the 47 hot springs.\u000aHot Springs Creek flows from Whittington Avenue, then is underground in a tunnel beneath Bathhouse Row (Central Ave). It emerges from the tunnel south of Bathhouse Row then flows through the southern part of the city before emptying into Lake Hamilton, a reservoir on the Ouachita River.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Climate ===\u000aHot Springs lies in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen Cfa). The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. July and August are the hottest months of the year, with an average high of 93 °F (34 °C) and an average low of 70.5 °F (21.4 °C). The city's highest temperature was 115 °F (46.1 °C), recorded in 1986. The lowest temperature recorded was \u22125 °F (\u221220.6 °C), in 1989\u000aPrecipitation is weakly seasonal, with a bimodal pattern: wet seasons in the spring and fall, and relatively drier summers and winters, but some rain in all months. The spring wet season is more pronounced than fall, with the highest rainfall in May. Hot Springs precipitation is impacted by the orographic effect of the Ouachita Mountains.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Demographics ==\u000aHot Springs is the principal city of the Hot Springs metropolitan area, which includes all of Garland County, registering a population of 96,024 in 2010 according to the United States Census Bureau.\u000aAs of the census of 2000, there were 35,750 people, 16,096 households, and 9,062 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,086.9 people per square mile (419.7/km2). There were 18,813 housing units at an average density of 572.0 per square mile (220.8/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 78.86% White, 16.87% Black or African American, 0.55% Native American, 0.79% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 1.02% from other races, and 1.86% from two or more races. 3.80% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\u000aThere were 16,096 households out of which 22.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.2% were married couples living together, 12.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43.7% are classified as non-families by the United States Census Bureau. Of 16,096 households, 690 are unmarried partner households: 580 heterosexual, 78 same-sex male, and 32 same-sex female. 38.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 18.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.12 and the average family size was 2.80.\u000aIn the city, the population was spread out with 20.2% under the age of 18, 8.2% from 18 to 24, 25.4% from 25 to 44, 23.0% from 45 to 64, and 23.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females there were 88.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.6 males.\u000aThe median income for a household in the city was $26,040, and the median income for a family was $32,819. Males had a median income of $25,861 versus $20,155 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,961. About 13.7% of families and 19.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 30.7% of those under age 18 and 11.7% of those age 65 or over.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Arts and culture ==\u000aThe city has been a tourist mecca for generations due to the thermal waters and attractions such as Oaklawn Park, a thoroughbred racing facility; Magic Springs and Crystal Falls theme parks; a fine arts community that has earned the city the No. 4 position among "America's Top 100 Small Arts Towns"; the Hot Springs Music Festival; and the Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival, held each October at the historic Malco Theater, attracting numerous Academy Award-winning films and producers.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Annual cultural events ===\u000aOther annual events in town include the Valley of the Vapors Music Festival, the free Hot Springs Jazz Festival in September, the free Hot Springs Blues Festival in September, the downtown Bathtub Races in the spring, the Big Barbecue Cookoff in spring and fall, the World's Shortest St. Patrick's Day Parade every March 17, and the outdoor skating rink November through January. Venues for live music are Low Key Arts, Maxine's, The Ohio Club, The Big Chill, and the Arlington Hotel among many others.\u000aSuperlift Offroad Vehicle Park hosts the annual Ouachita Jeep Jamboree, an off-road adventure weekend that draws people and their 4x4's from a dozen states.\u000aEducational institutes and conventions are important events in the spa city. Perhaps the most popular of these events is the Hot Springs Technology Institute (HSTI), drawing over 1,300 participants each June. Hot Springs is also home to the annual alternate reality game Midnight Madness, based on the movie from which it gets its name. Teams race throughout the city at night, solving clues based on difficult puzzle and physical challenges. Games last 12 hours or more, with the winning team designing the following year's game.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Tourism ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Arkansas Alligator Farm and Petting Zoo ====\u000a\u000aFounded on Whittington Avenue in 1902, the Arkansas Alligator Farm and Petting Zoo features approximately 200 alligators. The zoo also contains cougars, turkeys, chickens, wild boars, turtles, bobcats, and ring-tailed lemurs. A petting zoo with goats, emus, llamas, white-tailed deer, pigs, baby alligators, and other animals allows visitors to touch and feed the animals. An alligator feeding show includes educational material about the animals.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Bathhouse Row, Hot Springs National Park ====\u000a\u000aBathhouse Row, consisting of eight turn-of-the century historic buildings, lies within Hot Springs National Park and is managed by the National Park Service. Fordyce Bathhouse was restored in 1989 as the park's visitor center and the beginning of restoring all properties on Bathhouse Row. The series of renovations and leasing public spaces to commercial owners became a model for similar projects across the nation.\u000aBuckstaff Bathhouse has been in continuous operation since 1912 and is one of the best-preserved structures on Bathhouse Row. The Buckstaff Bathhouse Company has completed the majority of maintenance and renovation that has occurred without outside funding. The Quapaw was restored by the NPS in 2004, and the renovated structure was leased to Quapaw Baths, LLC, which now operates a modern spa with pools and hot tubs. The Lamar was renovated into offices for park staff and Bathhouse Row Emporium, the park's official store. The Superior Bathhouse Brewery and Distillery has occupied Superior Bathhouse since 2012, using hot spring water in its beers and spirits. As of February 2014, the Maurice, Ozark, and Hale bathhouses are all available for rent from the NPS.\u000aAtop Hot Springs Mountain in the park is the Hot Springs Mountain Tower, a 216-foot (66 m) observation tower built in 1982.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Central Avenue ====\u000a\u000aAlong Bathhouse Row is Central Avenue, Highway 7, lined with historic buildings, businesses and tourist attractions. Today preserved by NRHP as Hot Springs Central Avenue Historic District, the district includes 77 contributing properties to the district between Prospect Street and Park Avenue. Included within this district are the 1924 Arlington Hotel, the Medical Arts Building, a 1929 Art Deco high-rise, and the Wade Building, built in 1927 in the neoclassical style.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Garvan Woodland Gardens ====\u000a\u000aFounded by the daughter of a lumber and brick magnate in 1985, the 210-acre (85 ha) botanical garden on Arkridge Road features native Ouachita Mountains flora among rocky streams and waterfalls. Garvan also has a Japanese-themed section with several species native to Japan throughout. The garden is situated on a peninsula jutting into Lake Hamilton and began as Verna Garvan's personal garden for decades before being donated to the University of Arkansas landscape architecture department.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Historic hotels and districts ====\u000aThirteen of Hot Springs's hotels are individually listed by the NRHP within the city, with more being listed as contributing properties within other districts. Four of Hot Springs' neighborhoods are preserved as historic districts by the National Register of Historic Places, and the city also contains five historically important commercial districts in addition to the aforementioned Bathhouse Row and Central Avenue Historic District.\u000aThe city contains several historic hotels, including the Arlington Hotel, Jack Tar Hotel and Bathhouse, Mountainaire Hotel Historic District, Park Hotel, and the Riviera Hotel. During Hot Springs' heyday, several tourists visiting the city stayed at motor courts, the precursor to today's hotels. The NRHP recognizes seven of these motels as culturally and historically significant: Bellaire Court Historic District, Cottage Courts Historic District, Cove Tourist Court, George Klein Tourist Court Historic District, Lynwood Tourist Court Historic District, Parkway Courts Historic District, Perry Plaza Court Historic District, and the Taylor Rosamond Motel Historic District.\u000aThe Fordyce-Ricks House Historic District at 1501 Park Avenue includes three buildings on 37 acres (15 ha) formerly owned by Samuel W. Fordyce, a prominent businessman and railroad executive who moved to Hot Springs in 1876. The house and outbuildings are built as log cabins in the Adirondack style. The Pleasant Street Historic District along Malvern Avenue (colloquially "Black Broadway") contains 93 contiguous buildings associated with the city's African American community. Included within the district are the Visitors Chapel AME church and the Woodmen of Union Building, along with 69 other contributing structures. A variety of architectural styles are used, with many of the structures using brick facades. The Quapaw-Prospect Historic District contains 233 structures near downtown Hot Springs, with 139 residential houses contributing to the character of the district built between 1890 and 1950 in several architectural styles. The Whittington Park Historic District is a residential district lining Whittington Park, a long, narrow park between two one-way streets created by the National Park Service in 1897. The 1896\u20131960 district contains 60 single-family houses and ten other structures. Predominantly Craftsman, ranch and Queen Anne-style buildings, the district is northwest of downtown Hot Springs.\u000aSeven districts in Hot Springs have special historical significance to the city's past economy. In addition to the aforementioned Bathhouse Row and Central Avenue Historic District, the Army and Navy General Hospital Historic District includes 31 buildings surrounding and supporting the former Army-Navy Hospital. Built in 1933, the six-story brick building built in the Spanish Colonial Revival style with Art Deco detailing is the centerpiece of the district, and remains the most imposing figure on the Hot Springs skyline. The Forest Service Headquarters Historic District encompasses six structures on Winona and Indiana Streets built by the Civilian Conservation Corps as the headquarters of the Jessieville Ranger District of the Ouachita National Forest. The Hot Springs Railroad Warehouse Historic District preserves three brick buildings between the Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks and Broadway. Almost entirely unaltered, the 1920s structures are associated with the railroad industry, which was extremely important to Hot Springs in the early 20th century. As the city grew during the early 20th century, commercial activity developed along Ouachita Avenue south of Bathhouse Row, today preserved as the Ouachita Avenue Historic District. Mostly consisting of brick commercial and multifamily buildings, the district maintains the character of an historic commercial area. The 1905 Peter Joplin Commercial Block building was the only building to survive the 1913 "Black Friday" fire, making it a remnant of early commercial activity on Ouachita Avenue when all contemporary structures have been destroyed.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Lake Catherine and Lake Hamilton ====\u000a\u000aLake Hamilton and Lake Catherine are two reservoirs of the Ouachita River south of Hot Springs created for hydroelectric power generation and recreational uses. Both created by Arkansas Power & Light (AP&L), Lake Catherine formed following the construction of Remmel Dam in the 1920s. Following a donation of over 2,000 acres (810 ha), the state created Lake Catherine State Park in 1935. Today, the park features fishing and water recreation as well as camping to visitors. Lake Hamilton was created following the construction of Carpenter Dam in the 1930s. Built during the Great Depression, the power produced by the dam is credited with allowing AP&L to survive the difficult economic times. Following construction, resorts, businesses, and homes have been built along the lake, in contrast to Lake Catherine. Due to the economic importance of the dam to Hot Springs, Carpenter Dam was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Fishing is popular on Lake Hamilton, and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission operates a fish hatchery to stock the lake with bass and other species.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Oaklawn Park ====\u000a\u000aOaklawn Park has been in operation since 1904. (An additional horse racing park was once within the city limits, but was eventually closed.) The meet, which is annually held from January through mid-April each year, is sometimes referred to as the "Fifth Season" and features the "Racing Festival of the South" during the last week of the racing season each April. Many Triple Crown contenders compete in the Arkansas Derby, which is the big finale each year of the meet. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, his half-brother Roger, and Billy Bob Thornton, all Hot Springs natives, have been known to frequent Oaklawn Park in the past.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Sister city ===\u000a Hanamaki, Japan (established in 1993)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Government ==\u000aHot Springs operates under the council-manager form of city government, one of the two most common forms of local government in the United States, and common in smaller municipalities. The city is divided into six districts, which elect a city director to the seven-member board of directors. As a body, the board is the prime executive branch of Hot Springs government whose duties include making policy, creating a budget, and passing resolutions and ordinances. The seventh member is a mayor elected at-large by Hot Springs. The mayor presides over city functions in an official capacity and manages the municipal government, without legislative authority. City director elections are held every four years, but are staggered such that elections for three districts coincide with the election of the President of the United States and four occur in November of "off years".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Education ==\u000aHot Springs public secondary education includes five school districts, ultimately leading to graduation from five different high schools. The majority of Hot Springs is included in the Hot Springs School District, which leads to graduation from Hot Springs High School. The northern section of the city is within the Fountain Lake School District, leading to graduation from Fountain Lake High School. East of the Hot Springs School District is the Cutter\u2013Morning Star School District, leading to graduation from Cutter\u2013Morning Star High School, and the Lakeside School District, leading to graduation from Lakeside High School is located southeast of town. To the southwest, students are to be enrolled in Lake Hamilton School District, which leads to graduation from Lake Hamilton High School.\u000aThe Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts (ASMSA), an advanced statewide program within the University of Arkansas System and National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology, is also located in Hot Springs. A two-year residential program, ASMSA was established in 1993 and is available to students from across the state following acceptance. Hot Springs Christian School is the only private provider of K\u201312 education in Hot Springs. The only accredited post-secondary educational opportunity in Hot Springs is at National Park College. Created from a merger between Garland County Community College and Quapaw Technical Institute, the college enrolls approximately 3,000 students annually in credit programs. Champion Baptist College, an unaccredited four-year Christian vocational college associated with Gospel Light Baptist Church, is also located in Hot Springs. Champion Baptist College was issued a Letter of Exemption from Certification by the Arkansas Department of Higher Education to offer church-related courses and grant church-related degrees.\u000aHot Springs previously had a Catholic grade school for black children, St. Gabriel School; it closed in 1968. \u000a\u000a\u000a== Media ==\u000a\u000aThe Hot Springs newspaper is the Sentinel-Record, originally part of the Clyde E. Palmer chain, since renamed WEHCO Media. It is published daily.\u000aThe online newspaper is www.HotSpringsDaily.com. It lists up-to-the minute concise information about the city.\u000aThe Thrifty Nickel, a classified advertising publication, is published from offices at 670 Ouachita Avenue. The Little Rock edition is also published from this office.\u000aSeven AM radio stations and fifteen FM stations broadcast from the area.\u000aIn addition, most of the Little Rock radio stations provide at least secondary coverage of the city.\u000aHot Springs is part of the Little Rock television market.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Infrastructure ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Transportation ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Major highways ====\u000aU.S. Route 70 and U.S. Route 270 bypass the downtown to the south on the four-lane Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway. U.S. Route 70 Business passes through the center of Hot Springs as Grand Avenue, Summer Street, Albert Pike Road, and Airport Road, while U.S. Route 270 Business enters from the east as Malvern Avenue, joins US 70 Business along Grand Avenue and Summer Street, and exits to the west as Albert Pike Road. US-70 leads east 31 miles (50 km) to Benton and west-southwest 32 miles (51 km) to Glenwood, while US-270 leads southeast 20 miles (32 km) to Malvern and west-northwest 36 miles (58 km) to Mount Ida.\u000aArkansas Highway 7 passes through the center of Hot Springs as Central Avenue and Park Avenue.

In 1955 he transferred to Ministry of Foreign Affairs He was married and the father of two.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Professional life ==\u000aIn the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in addition to various offices at home, he served in the embassies in Prague, Chicago, Canberra and Sydney. In 1978 he was appointed as the chief concul in Los Angeles. Los Angeles was a critical point for Turkish representatives, for another chief concul Mehmet Baydar and vice consul Bahad\u0131r Demir were assassniated in 1973. Thus Ar\u0131kan left his two children in Canberra, Australia which was one of his former places of duty. In an interview to Los Angeles Times \u201cYou take precaution\u201d was his answer to a question about risks in Los Angeles .\u000a\u000a\u000a== Assassination ==\u000aOn 28 January 1982, at about 9.30, Ar\u0131kan drove from home to office. When he stopped at red stoplight two terrorists began shooting at him. He was hit 14 times. The two terrorists were Harry Sassounian (also known as Hampig Sassounian) and Krikor Saliba. Although Saliba disappeared without a trace, Sassounian was arrested and in 1984, he was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.\u000aIn 2002, prosecutors agreed to drop the so-called "national origin" special circumstance of the case, making Sassounian eligible for parole, in exchange for his admitting his guilt and formally apologizing. \u201cI participated in the murder of Kemal Arikan,\u201d Sassounian read aloud from a letter detailing the plea bargain. \u201cI renounce the use of terrorist tactics to achieve political goals. I regret the suffering of the Ar\u0131kan family.\u201d The California Prison Parole Board rejected Sassounian's demands of release in 2006, 2010 and 2013. California Board of Parole granted parole to Sassounian on 14 December 2016. Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the decision of his release and Turkish American groups urged the California Governor to deny parole. California Governor Jerry Brown denied the parole in May 2017 vetoing the board's decision. In a statement, Brown said he believes Sassounian would still pose "an unreasonable danger to society if released," adding that "The killing was a deliberate, planned assassination of a diplomat, plotted at least two weeks in advance."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Legacy ==\u000aTwo streets one in Pozant\u0131, Adana Province  and one in Ku\u015fadas\u0131, Ayd\u0131n Province  were named after Kemal Ar\u0131kan.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

The Capricorn Highway enters the suburb from the south and joins the Bruce Highway at a large round-about on the north-east corner of the suburb and then proceed north into Allenstown.\u000aNeerkol Creek is the south-western boundary of the suburb.\u000aFairy Bower is low-lying land, less than 10 metres above sea level, and contains a number of lagoons, including the Yeppen Yeppen Lagoon, the Crescent Lagoon, Nelson Lagoon and Deadmans Lagoon.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Big Bulls ==\u000aThe roundabout (often called the Yeppen roundabout presumably taking its name from the nearby Yeppen Yeppen Lagoon) where the highways meet is well known for the large statue of a Brahman bull that stands in the middle of the roundabout, being one of seven Big Bulls that decorate Rockhampton, which regards itself as the Beef Capital of Australia. The group of bull statues are listed as one of Australia's big things.\u000aThis particular bull attracts some criticism for facing towards the city so approaching motorists are welcomed to the city by a view of its rear end which includes its large testicles. The theft of the testicles from the bulls is a common prank and they frequently have to be replaced. Some residents also feel that the bull statues over-emphasise one aspect of the city and should be relocated to less prominent locations. However, there is strong public support for the retention of the bulls.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVRelativity is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher, first printed in December 1953.\u000aIt depicts a world in which the normal laws of gravity do not apply. The architectural structure seems to be the centre of an idyllic community, with most of its inhabitants casually going about their ordinary business, such as dining. There are windows and doorways leading to park-like outdoor settings. All of the figures are dressed in identical attire and have featureless bulb-shaped heads. Identical characters such as these can be found in many other Escher works.\u000aIn the world of Relativity, there are three sources of gravity, each being orthogonal to the two others. Each inhabitant lives in one of the gravity wells, where normal physical laws apply. There are sixteen characters, spread between each gravity source, six in one and five each in the other two. The apparent confusion of the lithograph print comes from the fact that the three gravity sources are depicted in the same space.\u000aThe structure has seven stairways, and each stairway can be used by people who belong to two different gravity sources. This creates interesting phenomena, such as in the top stairway, where two inhabitants use the same stairway in the same direction and on the same side, but each using a different face of each step; thus, one descends the stairway as the other climbs it, even while moving in the same direction nearly side-by-side. In the other stairways, inhabitants are depicted as climbing the stairways upside-down, but based on their own gravity source, they are climbing normally.\u000aEach of the three parks belongs to one of the gravity wells. All but one of the doors seem to lead to basements below the parks. Though physically possible, such basements are certainly unusual and add to the surreal effect of the picture.\u000aThis is one of Escher\u2019s most popular works and has been used in a variety of ways.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Hazza bin Zayed Stadium (Arabic: \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u062f \u0647\u0632\u0627\u0639 \u0628\u0646 \u0632\u0627\u064a\u062f\u200e) is a multi-purpose stadium, located in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, City of Al Ain, United Arab Emirates. It is the home stadium of Al Ain FC of the UAE Pro-League. The stadium holds 22,717 spectators and opened in 2014. The stadium was named after the chairman of the club, Sheikh Hazza bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.\u000aThe 45,000sqm Hazza bin Zayed stadium is split over seven levels, and is hailed as one of the most modern and unique sporting venues in the Middle East. It is one of the most sophisticated sports venues in the region and is poised to become a central destination for citizens and residents in the United Arab Emirates, as well as tourists visiting from all over the world. The stadium was also named as the 2014's Stadium of the Year by StadiumDB.com.\u000aThe stadium was broke ground in April 2012 and was completed in December 2014. It was planned that Al Ain faced Manchester City in the inaugural ceremony of the stadium, but City drew 1\u20131 with Blackburn Rovers in an English FA Cup match on 4 January and a replay with Rovers scheduled on 15 January prevented the English Premier League champions from a trip to the UAE. However the friendly was instead played after the Premier League season was over and Manchester City beat Al Ain 3\u20130. The stadium will also host the 2017 and 2018 FIFA Club World Cups and the 2019 AFC Asian Cup.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Location and design ==\u000a\u000aThe 25,000 seat stadium is located in Al Ain, approximately 150 kilometres east of Abu Dhabi, close to the borders of Oman. It was designed and built under a contract for a multi-functional stadium in the United Arab Emirates.\u000aClient was represented by AAFAQ Holdings. The project was realised in close cooperation with sister companies BAM Sports, specialised in stadium construction, and BAM Contractors from Ireland. The scope of work included the construction of a multi-functional stadium with a gross floor area of 45,000 square metres. In addition BAM built a six-storey office building, a sports hall and external works comprising roads, car parking, playing fields and landscaping. The stadium architects were London based Pattern Design.\u000aOne of the most characteristic elements of the stadium is the external facade which consists of fabric elements resembling the trunk of a palm tree that also can be lighted by LED lights in 15 different content modes. On the top of the stadium roof, 200 floodlights are fixed to provide the illumination of after-dark soccer games. Due to the extreme temperatures during the hot summer months, the palm bowl shape of the roof also provides pleasant conditions for both the players and the fans. It is one of the stadium's unique features, which is designed in a way that matches can take place in the shadow after 5pm. On the inside, it reveals the complex geometry of its cantilevered steel trusses, which was achieved by using robotic cutting and welding technology. The stadium is the first stadium in the world to featuring a unique parasol roof designed specifically to fully shade all fans.\u000aHazza Bin Zayed Stadium was voted Stadium of the Year 2014.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe stadium has been completed after a 16-month ultra-fast track construction project after being started on 1 June 2012. Built to FIFA standards, the stadium covers an area of 45,000 square metres with a capacity of 25,000 seats. The scope of the project further included a sports hall, commercial buildings and extensive exterior landscaping. The stadium is part of another further development that covers 500,000 square metres and includes 700 apartments, green spaces, two office buildings, 50 restaurants, shops and a 170-room hotel.\u000aThe project is the first component of this broader development that will have its effect first on the city of Al Ain, but also on the wider region including the neighboring countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. It was a design and build contract. BAM introduced a lot of value engineering proposals which had to be integrated into the design and therefore new building permits were required within the 18 months. BAM International started the project in mid-2012 and remained right on schedule with all aspects of the construction, making use of 10.5 million man hours. At peak there were 400 men staff up to the supervisor level and 4500 labourers on site.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Facilities ==\u000aThe stadium is an integral part of a new, wider community. Over the next four years, it will become the centrepiece of a planned 500,000 square-metre development that will include a 175-room hotel, a community of 700 residential units in a complex of apartments and green spaces, two office buildings, a sports centre, retail outlets and 50 restaurants.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Transportation ==\u000aThere are a number of routes to get to Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium.

aVIn a variety of applications, a shock mount is a mechanical fastener that connects two parts elastically. They are used for shock and vibration isolation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Design ==\u000aRubber bushings compress synthetic rubber rings on bolts to provide some isolation. Other shock mounts have mechanical springs or an elastomer (in tension or compression) engineered to isolate an item from specified mechanical shock and vibration. Some form of dashpot is usually used with a spring to provide viscous damping. Viscoelastic materials are common. Maxwell and Kelvin\u2013Voigt models of viscoelasticity use springs and dashpots in series and parallel circuits respectively. Hydraulic and pneumatic components can be included, depending on the use.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Microphone mount ==\u000aShock mounts for microphones can provide basic protection from damage, but their prime use is to isolate microphones from mechanically transmitted noise. This can originate as floor vibrations transmitted through a floor stand, or as "finger" and other handling noise on boom poles. All microphones behave to some extent as accelerometers, with the most sensitive axis being perpendicular to the diaphragm. Additionally, some microphones contain internal elements such as vacuum tubes and transformers which can be inherently microphonic. These are often cushioned by resilient internal methods, in addition to the employment of external isolation mounts.\u000aTraditionally the large side-address studio microphone has been strung in a "cat's cradle" mount, using fabric-wound rubber elastic elements to provide isolation. These designs still find some favour, although the elements tend to deteriorate, and sag with time. Newer designs, such as Rycote's "USM" lyre [4], use plastic elastomers, and patented spring shapes to reduce this problem.\u000aFor end-fire microphones, most often employed for location work, similar elastic stringing was once used. More recently designs moved to o-ring elements, before the Rycote Lyre [5] and Cinela Osix [6] suspensions were introduced. These use spring element designs that give far greater displacement along the microphone's prime axis, while limiting it on the other two. This enables excellent isolation while retaining good control of the microphone.\u000a[4]http://www.reddingaudio.com/rycote-invision-studio.php [5]http://www.ips.org.uk/files/11_Rycote_Lyre_Suspensions.pdf [6]http://www.cinela.fr/catalog.php?pid=6\u000a\u000a\u000a== Mounting machinery ==\u000aMachinery may have flexible mounts to help control vibration and reduce noise. Automobile engines usually have flexible mounts to reduce operating noise.\u000aNaval ships have special shock mounts to minimize machinery noise being transmitted to the water. The shock mounts help protect the shipboard operating equipment from the shock of explosions.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Disc drives ==\u000aShock mounts are found in some disc drives and compact disc players, in which soft bushings are all that mechanically hold the disk and reading assembly, thereby isolating it from outside vibrations and from other outside loads such as torsion.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other ==\u000a\u000aShock mounts can be found in a wide variety of applications.\u000aA similar idea, also known as a shock mount, is found in furniture design, introduced by Charles and Ray Eames. This provides some shock absorption and serves as a living hinge, allowing the seat back to pivot.\u000aShock mounts are also used in bicycle seats.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aBushing\u000aVibration isolation\u000aShock absorber\u000aMIL-S-901\u000aMicrophonism\u000aCushioning\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000aDeSilva, C.

aVA chafing dish (from the French chauffer, "to make warm") is a kind of portable grate raised on a tripod, originally heated with charcoal in a brazier, and used for foods that require gentle cooking, away from the "fierce" heat of direct flames. The chafing dish could be used at table or provided with a cover for keeping food warm on a buffet. Double dishes that provide a protective water jacket are known as bains-marie and help keep delicate foods, such as fish, warm while preventing overcooking.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe Roman politician and writer Cicero described a "kind of saucepan of Corinthian brass", writing "This simple and ingenious vessel possesses a double bottom, the upper one holds the light delicacies . . . and the fire is lit underneath".\u000aFragments of ceramic chafing dishes are common in the archaeology of medieval city sites, such as York, England. Chafing dishes in the form of charcoal-burning braziers are familiar in 17th-century American inventories almost from the start. François Pierre La Varenne, Le Cuisinier françois (Paris, 1652) mentions the use of a réchaut in a recipe for champignons à l'olivier. In describing the Velasquez genre painting (illustration), sometimes art historians not handy in the kitchen describe her as frying eggs in her earthenware dish. In 1520, Hernan Cortez reported to Charles V the manner in which Montezuma was served meals in Tenochtitlan:\u000a"He was served in the following manner: Every day as soon as it was light, six hundred nobles and men of rank were in attendance at the palace, who either sat, or walked about the halls and galleries, and passed their time in conversation, but without entering the apartment where his person was. The servants and attendants of these nobles remained in the court-yards, of which there were two or three of great extent, and in the adjoining street, which was also very spacious. They all remained in attendance from morning until night; and when his meals were served, the nobles were likewise served with equal profusion, and their servants and secretaries also had their allowance. Daily his larder and wine-cellar were open to all who wished to eat or drink. The meals were served by three or four hundred youths, who brought on an infinite variety of dishes; indeed, whenever he dined or supped, the table was loaded with every kind of flesh, fish, fruits, and vegetables that the country produced. As the climate is cold, they put a chafing-dish with live coals under every plate and dish, to keep them warm..." [1]\u000a\u000aIn England silver braziers without handles, upon which a dish would be set, are mentioned in the reign of Queen Anne; wooden balls kept the heat of the charcoal in the pierced container from being transferred to the table surface. Dish-crosses and the chafing dish with a handle were introductions of the reign of George II. In the American colonies, "One chafing dish" was inventoried among the silver at Abraham de Peyster's death in New York, 1728, though only two colonial New York examples are known to survive.\u000aIn a light form and heated over a spirit lamp, a chafing dish could also be used for cooking various dainty dishes at table\u2014 of fish, cream, eggs or cheese\u2014 for which silver chafing dishes with fine heat-insulating wooden handles were made in the late 19th century, when "chafing-dish suppers" became fashionable, even in households where a kitchen maid prepared all the ingredients beforehand. Specialized chafing-dish cookbooks appeared from the 1880s. A book of chafing-dish recipes printed for the silversmiths, Gorham Manufacturing Co. in New York, (2nd edition, 1894), featured a brief history of chafing dishes, followed by proper instruction for use, suggesting its novelty. Fannie Farmer's Chafing Dish Possibilities was published in Boston in 1898.\u000aModern chafing dishes are made of light metal or ceramic casseroles with handles, sometimes covered with a Pyrex lid. Classic uses of a chafing-dish are in preparing Welsh rarebit or cheese fondue.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aChafing fuel\u000aList of cooking vessels\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aBraziers and chafing dishes

She is probably best known for her 2009 book, Latinos in Pasadena.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life and education ==\u000aMartinez was born in Los Angeles, California. She was delivered by a Chinese doctor in what is known as Chinatown at the (then) French Hospital. She was raised in East Los Angeles, California by her parents. Her parents married at an older age and she is an only child. Martinez received her early education in the Los Angeles Unified School District. She attended Eastman Avenue Elementary School, Robert Louis Stevenson Jr. High School, and Garfield High School. She attended High School during the Chicano movement that occurred in the 1960s, otherwise known as the Civil Rights Era. She graduated from high school in January 1970. Her academic performance was not great, but that did not dismantle her love for education. Martinez still had aspirations in pursuing higher education due to her parents\u2019 strong educational values and influences. Her parents always encouraged her to be an independent and brave woman. Her teachers also had an impact in her life due to the fact that they were supportive and dedicated to their profession.

aVThe Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA) was a charity, and an executive non-departmental public body (NDPB) of the Department for Education. In England and Northern Ireland, the QCDA maintained and developed the National Curriculum and associated assessments, tests and examinations, advising the minister formerly known as the Secretary of State for Education on these matters.\u000aRegulatory functions regarding examination and assessment boards have been transferred to Ofqual, an independent regulator.\u000aEducation and qualifications in Scotland and Wales are the responsibility of the Scottish Government and Welsh Government and their agencies. In Scotland, for example, the Scottish Qualifications Authority is the responsible body.\u000aIn May 2010 the Secretary of State announced his intention to promote legislation that would transfer obligations of the QCDA to Ofqual. The newly formed Standards and Testing Agency took on the functions of the agency 3 October 2011.

The QCA had additional powers and duties granted to it by the Education Act 1997, which established the role of the QCA. Under Section 24 of this Act, QCA was granted the right to regulate all external qualifications in England.\u000aIn April 2004, the QCA also launched the National Assessment Agency to take over the delivery and administration of National Curriculum assessments. The National Assessment Agency was transformed into a subdivision and its functions subsumed within the management structure of the QCA.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Formation of Ofqual ===\u000aOn 26 September 2007, DCSF announced that the regulatory functions of the QCA were to become statutorily independent with transferring QCA's obligations to Ofqual.\u000aOn 8 April 2008, Ofqual began work as the independent regulator of exams and tests in England, accountable to Parliament rather than to government ministers. The remaining work of the QCA was transferred to the Ofqual.

aV"Hey Hey Hey" is a song recorded by American singer Katy Perry for her fifth studio album Witness (2017). It was sent to Italian contemporary hit radio stations on January 12, 2018 by Universal Music Group as the album's fourth single. The song was written by Perry, Sia Furler, Sarah Hudson, Max Martin and Ali Payami, while production was handled by Martin and Payami. "Hey Hey Hey" is a rock and electronica-influenced, dark dream pop and electropop track; its lyrical theme is female empowerment. Reviewers speculated that the song was also about the 2016 United States presidential election nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.\u000aMusic critics gave mixed reviews of "Hey Hey Hey", praising it as one of the highlights of Witness, while others deemed it mediocre and called it a failed attempt at duplicating the success of Perry's older hits. It was also compared to the works of American singer Britney Spears and New Zealand recording artist Lorde. To accompany the track, a music video was uploaded onto Perry's official YouTube account on December 20, 2017. The clip was filmed by Isaac Rentz in Beverly Hills, California and is set in the 18th century and the Ancien Régime, with the singer's outfits resembling those of the last Queen of France Marie Antoinette and French heroine Joan of Arc. For further promotion, Perry gave several live performances of "Hey Hey Hey", including those during her concert tour Witness: The Tour (2017\u20132018) and her four-day YouTube live stream Katy Perry Live: Witness World Wide (2017). Commercially, the song appeared on charts in New Zealand and Sweden.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Recording and composition ==\u000a\u000a"Hey Hey Hey" was recorded at MXM Studios in Los Angeles, California, and at Wolf Cousins Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. It was mixed at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia, by Serban Ghenea and John Hanes, and mastered at Sterling Sound in New York City by Randy Merrill. It was written by Katy Perry, Sia Furler, Sarah Hudson, Max Martin and Ali Payami; and was produced by Martin and Payami. Martin performed percussion on the track and Payami provided percussion, bass, synths and piano. Cory Bice and Jeremy Lertola both served as engineer assistants and Peter Karlsson was credited as vocal producer. Perry sang lead and background vocals for "Hey Hey Hey", with Astrid S providing additional background vocals. The song is the second track on Witness (2017), Perry's fifth studio album.\u000aMusically, "Hey Hey Hey" is a rock and electronica-influenced, dark dream pop and "2000s" electropop song. It lyrically "asserts that women can be complex people with a multitude of personality traits" and deals with themes of female empowerment. Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club wrote that "the song depicts a narrow version of femininity and success\u2014lipstick and a dress, and being rich, respectively\u2014and it perpetuates irksome stereotypes about strong women". Lyrics from "Hey Hey Hey" include: "A hot little hurricane/'Cause I'm feminine and soft, but I'm still a boss, yeah/Red lipstick but still so raw, yeah/ [...] I smell like a rose and I pierce like a thorn", and "I ain't got no strings/I'm no one's little puppet". Throughout the recording, Perry denies "she's a fragile little Fabergé", and refers to herself as "a seasoned PR pro". NME writer Leonie Cooper described the line, "Marilyn Monroe in a monster truck" as "retro-meets-trashy" and Lana Del Rey-influenced.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Critical reception ==\u000aUpon its release, music critics gave "Hey Hey Hey" mixed reviews. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised Perry for being "at her most effective and comfortable". Idolator writer Mike Wass positively likened the track to material from American singer Britney Spears' seventh studio album Femme Fatale (2011), and called it a highlight of Witness. Although labelling the production of "Hey Hey Hey" formulaic, Andy Gill of The Independent also highlighted the song as one of the best on the album. Cooper of NME compared the recording's "languid, spacious sound" to the works of New Zealand singer Lorde.\u000aOther reviewers speculated that "Hey Hey Hey" dealt with the 2016 United States presidential election nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, with Perry taking side with the latter. Zaleski of The A.V. Club was negative towards the track, calling it "galling" and "particularly oblivious". She noted the line, "'Cause I'm feminine and soft, but I'm still a boss, yeah", was not in concordance with the "not {...] warm or relatable" Clinton, whom Perry supported on multiple occasions. The Los Angeles Times's Mikael Wood negatively wrote: " 'Hey Hey Hey' plays like a weak attempt to duplicate the success of her uplifting 2013 smash 'Roar', this time with a paper-thin tune and clunky words". Fabian Gorsler from Highsnobiety described the single as "underwhelming".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Music video ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Production and release ===\u000aBefore the release of an accompanying music video for "Hey Hey Hey", Perry began teasing it with a series of the last Queen of France Marie Antoinette-themed pictures of herself. The clip was subsequently uploaded onto the singer's official YouTube channel on December 20, 2017, with a behind-the-scenes video premiering on January 4, 2018 on the same platform. When posting the clip on her Instagram account, Perry added the caption:\u000a\u000aAfter a year of peaks and valleys (remember, it's all a journey), I wanted to end 2017 with a fun, triumphant piece of pop candy. Just think of it as a glam little stocking stuffer from me to you. 'Hey Hey Hey' is one of my favorite songs from "Witness" and for me, it embodies the fighting spirit I always want you to be able to find within yourself, and to see in me.\u000a\u000aThe song's video was filmed in Beverly Hills, California by Isaac Rentz, and was produced by Nina Dluhy-Miller and Danny Lockwood. Six backup dancers were hired; Megan Lawson was credited as their choreographer. During the accompanying behind-the-scenes video, Perry resumed the clip's message: "You don't have to be just one thing if you're a woman, you can be all things. And just 'cause you're vulnerable does not make you weak". Reviewers said the music video depicts events occurring in the 18th century and Ancien Régime, while also incorporating modern elements. During the clip, Perry wears a sculptural blonde wig with curls, and her looks resemble those of French heroine Joan of Arc and Antoinette. Joey Nolfi of Entertainment Weekly found similarities between the singer's wardrobe and that of Sofia Coppola's 2006 film Marie Antoinette.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Synopsis ===\u000a\u000aThe music video opens with a shot of a castle and one of its French-inspired hallways. Lying in her bed, Perry is awakened by the sound of a horn blown by three women, and is given a brown drink ("Napoleon's Coffee") and her smartphone, where she communicates in-video with Prince Piggy (played by Tad Brown) regarding their date. The three women are seen cleaning Perry's underwear, lacing her corset and walking with books on their heads, among other activities. Perry, seemingly overwhelmed, falls down and sees a book titled "JOAN!", with its cover displaying a female warrior. The video subsequently transitions to a scene depicting Perry holding a sword and wearing a dress with an eye placed on her breast. She dances with three female background dancers and eats cake with them.\u000aFollowing this, a scene shows Perry's and Prince Piggy's date; the latter makes advances towards Perry and arranges his vegetables on his plate to spell DTF. Disgusted, Perry seeks the advice of her friend Lord Markus on her phone, who tells her to "get out of there!". Perry then fights with Prince Piggy in a video game theme, defeating him. Returning to the video's main plot, Perry and the prince dance together and watch a puppet show. Prince Piggy tries to kiss the singer; she slaps him and gets decapitated, but her head is picked up by the version of Perry seen earlier. The clip ends with Perry running with her sword towards the prince and his servants.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Reception ===\u000aCritics gave mixed reviews of the music video upon its premiere. Nina Braca from Billboard called it "triumphant", while The Malay Mail said it was "humorous", and Nolfi from Entertainment Weekly described it as "candy-colored". Direct Lyrics' Kevin Apaza wrote: "We totally dug this video. We liked the high budget, all the perfect details, the deep message conveyed, and of course Katy's humor too". Ross McNeilage from MTV UK similarly praised the video, pointing out its "high-concept" and stating: "The [...] singer's visual treatment brings the lyrics to life, highlighting its themes of resilience with a fitting storyline. Despite the serious undertones of defiance, the video is jam-packed with Katy's goofy humour throughout and doesn't take itself too seriously at all." Evan Jorssen of NRJ likened the three women seen in the clip accompanying Perry to characters from the 1993 American comedy horror fantasy film Hocus Pocus and the 1899 French film Cinderella. Julien Goncalves of Pure Charts compared parts of the video's concept to Madonna's live performance of "Vogue" (1990) at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards. In a negative review, Highsnobiety's Gorsler wrote: "The visuals are, to put it kindly, less than stellar, with over-the-top production and a lavishly nonsensical plot making the music video one of the weirdest things to come out this year. But all that is to be expected from an artist like Katy Perry, who is famous for her eccentricity." He also criticized the heavy product placement and the use of an air horn rap trumpet sound at the beginning of the video, which "sound[s] like Katy Perry spent a little too much time playing around with Virtual DJ". Vice magazine also slightly criticized the product placement sequences.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Live performances ==\u000aPerry promoted "Hey Hey Hey" with several live performances and included the song in the closing segment of her Witness: The Tour (2017\u20132018) concert tour, where she performed it on a Tron-style motorcycle. Perry also sang the track during her four-day YouTube live stream Katy Perry Live: Witness World Wide (2017); at the Glastonbury Festival near Pilton, Somerset, England, on June 24, and for British radio station Kiss on June 26, 2017, where she performed an acoustic version of the song.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Credits and personnel ==\u000aCredits and personnel adapted from the liner notes of Witness.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Recording ===\u000aRecorded at MXM Studios (Los Angeles, California), MXM Studios (Stockholm, Sweden) and Wolf Cousins Studios (Stockholm, Sweden)\u000aMixed at MixStar Studios (Virginia Beach, Virginia)\u000aMastered at Sterling Sound (New York City, New York)\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Personnel ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Charts ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Release history ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVDuane Steele is a Canadian country music artist. He has released five studio albums and one greatest hits album, and has charted multiple singles on the Canadian country singles charts, including the Number One hit "Anita Got Married" in 1996.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aDuane Steele's career began when he became the lead singer of the band Rock 'N' Horse in 1984. The band released one album, Highways, in 1991, and the song "Real Good Love" reached No. 69 on the Canadian country singles chart. However, members of the band went their separate ways in 1993.\u000aSteele moved to Nashville and signed a publishing contract with Warner-Chappell. He scored a record deal with Mercury Records in 1995 after a performance during Canadian Country Music Week. The following year, he released his debut solo album, P.O. Box 423. The first four singles from the project all reached the top 10 on the Canadian country chart, including "Anita Got Married," which became Steele's first No. 1 song. He was nominated for the Vista Rising Star Award by the Canadian Country Music Association (CCMA) in 1996, but lost to Terri Clark. He also received a nomination for Male Vocalist of the Year. In 1997, the Juno Awards nominated Steele for Best Country Male Vocalist, and also the all-genre Best New Solo Artist. He won his first award, Vocal Event of the Year, at the 1997 CCMA Awards for his duet with Lisa Brokop, "Two Names On An Overpass."\u000aSteele's second album, This Is the Life, was released in September 1997. The disc included a cover of Gordon Lightfoot's "If You Could Read My Mind." The first two singles, "Tell The Girl" and "If I Could Just Get To You," both reached the Canadian top 10. Steele was again nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year in 1998 at both the CCMA Awards and the Juno Awards. When subsequent singles failed to reach the top 30, Steele and Mercury parted ways.\u000aSteele moved back to Canada in 1999 and began writing for his third album. I'll Be Alright was released in August 2000 on Steele's own Jolt Records and distributed by Royalty Records. Seven singles were released from the project, including "The Good Side Of Your Goodbye," "This Is Love," "I-65" and "The Heart Of The It Don't Matter." In 2001, the CCMA named Steele Independent Male Artist of the Year.\u000aSteele released a greatest hits album, Set List, in 2004. The album collected seventeen of Steele's biggest hits, along with three new songs. Steele's fourth studio album, Ghost Town, was released in 2006 on Icon Records. It was followed by Gas and Time, released in 2010 on Jolt.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Studio albums ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Compilation albums ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Singles ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== 1990s ====\u000a\u000a\u000a==== 2000s and 2010s ====\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Featured singles ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Music videos ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Awards ==\u000aCanadian Country Music Awards\u000a1997 - Vocal Collaboration of the Year ("Two Names On An Overpass" with Lisa Brokop)\u000a2001 - Independent Male Artist of the Year\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aDuane Steele

aVJohn Ormsby (1829\u20131895) was a nineteenth-century British translator. He is most famous for his 1885 English translation of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote de la Mancha, perhaps the most scholarly and accurate English translation of the novel up to that time. It is so precise that Samuel Putnam, who published his own English translation of the novel in 1949, faults Ormsby for duplicating Cervantes' pronouns so closely that the meaning of the sentences sometimes becomes confusing.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aHe was born at Gortner Abbey, co. Mayo, on 25 April 1829, was the eldest son of George Ormsby (died 1836), a captain in the 3rd dragoons and high sheriff of co. Mayo in 1827, and his wife Marianne, third daughter of Humphrey Jones of Mullinabro, co. Kilkenny. He was a direct descendant of the Ormsby family which migrated from Lincolnshire to co. Mayo in the reign of Elizabeth. On the death of both parents during his childhood, he was placed under the guardianship of Denis Brown, dean of Emly. He was educated at Dr. Roman's private school at Seapoint, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated B.A. in 1843, and he won a silver medal for chemistry at the university of London in 1846. Two years later, he was admitted at the Middle Temple, but he was never called to the bar. His literary tastes were developed early, and he contributed papers of travel to Fraser's Magazine, to the Saturday Review, and to the early numbers of the Cornhill and the Pall Mall Gazette. He lived at this period in King's Bench Walk in the Temple, a 'denizen of Bohemia, but of the cultivated and scholarlike Bohemia,' and his friends often remarked that he would be an 'excellent representative of Warrington in "Pendennis."' He was extremely well read in eighteenth-century literature, and especially in Defoe, Fielding, and Boswell.\u000aHe was a member of the Alpine Club almost from its inauguration in 1858. He was one of the first party to climb the Pic de Grivola in August 1859, and he contributed an amusing paper on 'The Ascent of the Grivola' to the second volume of the second series of Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers, by members of the Alpine Club (1862).\u000aIn 1864, he published Autumn Rambles in North Africa, travel sketches from La Grande Kabylie and Tunis during 1863-4, originally contributed for the most part to Fraser, with illustrations by the author. In 1876, he collected in volume form his Stray Papers, including some amusing pieces, 'Sandford and Merton,' 'Mme. Tussaud's,' and 'Swift on the Turf.' In 1879, he published a translation from Spanish of the Poem of the Cid, dedicated to Pascual de Gayangos.\u000a\u000a\u000a== His translation of Don Quixote ==\u000aOrmsby's translation has seen more editions than any other nineteenth-century English version of the novel, having been included in the Heritage Book Club series of great novels, and in the Great Books of the Western World set. The contemporaneous translations by Alexander James Duffield (1881) and Henry Edward Watts (1888) have been virtually forgotten. Ormsby's translation was the first English version of Cervantes's book to appear complete on the Internet.\u000aOrmsby not only translates the novel; he provides a long and informative introduction with a brief analysis of all the major English versions of "Don Quixote" up to then (except for the Duffield version), as well as explaining the conceptual choices that he himself made in translating the novel, in terms of affectation, for example, or using the simplest everyday language. He also features a short biography of Cervantes in his introduction, as well as providing his own controversial analysis of the work. Ormsby refutes the widely accepted view that "Don Quixote" is a sad novel with allegorical meanings and a pessimistic philosophy, and states that because Cervantes himself declared it to be a satire against books of chivalry, it is primarily only that, although it does contain much observation on human character. Ormsby also refutes, in addition, the commonly held view that Don Quixote is an innately noble person, stating that his nobility of character is an attitude that he assumes simply to imitate his knightly heroes. An 1886 edition of the Quarterly Review, published only a year after Ormsby's translation was first issued, took him to task for his limited interpretation of the novel and of Don Quixote's character, while praising the accuracy of the translation.\u000aAlthough he keeps referring to Don Quixote as a "great classic", he's far from being an unquestioning admirer of Cervantes's work. Ormsby was at times highly critical of the author's writing habits and linguistic style. He wrote, for example: \u201cNever was great work so neglected by its author. That it was written carelessly, hastily, and by fits and starts, was not always his fault, but it seems clear he never read what he sent to the press.\u201d. He wrote two versions of his introductory analysis, a longer version published in the original 1885 edition of his translation, in which he severely criticized Cervantes's writing style, and a more concise version (the one published in most editions of the translation), in which some of the criticisms have been omitted.\u000aOrmsby also provided his own footnotes for his translation.\u000aA revised version of Ormsby's translation, by Kenneth Douglas and Joseph Jones, was published by W. W. Norton in 1981 (ISBN 0393090183). It is out of print (do not confuse it with Norton's current text), but easily found.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000aAttribution\u000a This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Seccombe, Thomas (1901).

aVHaircloth is a stiff, unsupple fabric typically made from horsehair and/or from the wooly hair of a camel. Although horsehair generally refers to the hair of a horse's mane or tail, haircloth itself is sometimes called horsehair. Horse or camel hair woven into haircloth may be fashioned into clothing or upholstery.\u000aIn the history of brewing, for drying the malt, haircloth was spread over the kiln floor to keep grain from dropping down into the furnace. Perforated metal or tile (gratings, meshes) were also used, but had a drawback of scorching the grain.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVI'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue is a BBC radio comedy panel game. Introduced as "the antidote to panel games", it consists of two teams of two comedians "given silly things to do" by a chairman. The show launched in April 1972 as a parody of radio and TV panel games, and has been broadcast since on BBC Radio 4 and the BBC World Service, with repeats aired on BBC Radio 4 Extra. The 50th series was broadcast in November and December 2007.\u000aAfter a period of split chairmanship in the first series, Humphrey Lyttelton ("Humph") served in this role from the programme's inception until his death in 2008. In April 2008, following the hospitalisation and subsequent death of Lyttelton, recording of the 51st series was postponed. The show recommenced on 15 June 2009 with Lyttelton being replaced by a trio of hosts serving in tandem: Stephen Fry, Jack Dee and Rob Brydon. Dee went on to host all episodes of the 52nd series later that year. He continues in that role for forthcoming series. The chairman's script is written by Iain Pattinson, who has worked on the show since 1992.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aI'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue developed from the long-running radio sketch show I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again, the writers of which were John Cleese, Jo Kendall, David Hatch, Bill Oddie, Tim Brooke-Taylor and especially Graeme Garden who suggested the idea of an unscripted show which, it was decided, would take the form of a parody panel game. A panel game with no competition was not itself a new idea: the BBC had a history of successful quiz shows designed to allow witty celebrities to entertain where winning was not important. Examples include Ignorance is Bliss, Just a Minute, My Word! and My Music on the radio and Call My Bluff on television.\u000aThe pilot episode (where it was originally called I'm Sorry, They're At It Again) opened with Graeme Garden and Jo Kendall singing the words of "Three Blind Mice" to the tune of "Ol' Man River" followed by Bill Oddie and Tim Brooke-Taylor performing the lyrics of "Sing a Song of Sixpence" to the melody of "These Foolish Things". Dave Lee, who was bandleader on I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again, was at the piano and a number of rounds were introduced by a short phrase of music. Other rounds included "Dialogue Read in a Specific Accent" and "Songs Sung as Animals". In 1974 Bill Oddie was replaced by Willie Rushton, with Barry Cryer as Graeme Garden's teammate, and Humphrey Lyttelton as chairman, and the personnel remained constant from this point until Rushton's death in 1996. Since then the fourth seat on the panel has featured a variety of guest comedians.\u000aThe show has over two million listeners on Radio 4 and its recording sessions typically fill 1500-seat theatres within a week of being advertised. At least one recording for the spring 2006 series filled all its seats within three hours of the free tickets being made available, and the London recording of the autumn series in that year sold out in ten minutes. Although there are twelve Clue shows broadcast per year these are the result of just six recording sessions, with two programmes being recorded back-to-back. The show was recently voted the second funniest radio programme ever, after The Goon Show. It has a large following among professional comedians such as Armando Iannucci, who turned down opportunities to work on it, preferring to remain a listener.\u000a\u000aThe official, authorised history of the show and ISIRTA, The Clue Bible by Jem Roberts, was published by Preface Publishing in October 2009.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Participants ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Chairman ===\u000aHumphrey Lyttelton, primarily known as a jazz trumpeter and bandleader, was invited to be chairman because of the role played by improvisation in both comedy and jazz music. In the first series Lyttelton shared the role of chairman with Barry Cryer but he made it his own (especially once Cryer replaced Cleese as a regular panellist) and continued as chairman until his death on 25 April 2008. He read the script introducing the programme and segments in an utterly deadpan manner. He claimed the secret was just to read what was in front of him without understanding why it was funny. He adopted the grumpy persona of someone who would really rather be somewhere else, which he attributed to worrying that, surrounded by four professional comedians, he would have nothing worthwhile to chip in. He did occasionally depart from the script, however, often bringing the house down with an ad-lib. He was credited by the regular panellists as being the chief reason for the show's longevity.\u000aOn 18 April 2008 the producer of I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, Jon Naismith, announced that, owing to hospitalisation to repair an aortic aneurysm, Humphrey Lyttelton would be unable to record the scheduled shows and that they would have to be postponed. The final show of the 2008 Best of tour on 22 April would be presented by Rob Brydon. Following Lyttelton's death there was speculation that the series might be cancelled because replacing him would be extremely difficult if not impossible. In a eulogy in The Guardian Barry Cryer did not allude to the future of the programme but said that there's "got to be an agonising reappraisal" and that Lyttelton was the "very hub of the show". Cryer, Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden all ruled themselves out as hosts: Cryer did not think the programme would work if a panellist became chairman and it "would need somebody of stature to be parachuted in". Jeremy Hardy also ruled himself out, saying "Humph had big shoes to fill and I wouldn't do it."\u000aIn the Clue mailout for September 2008 Naismith stated: "Despite the rumours, we've made no decisions about possible replacements for Humph, and are unlikely to make any decisions this year at least. Certainly I don't envisage us selecting anyone on a permanent basis for several series." It was announced that the show would continue recording beginning in 2009. The first new shows would be hosted by rotating guest presenters (similarly to the format of Have I Got News for You) before a permanent replacement host was decided. In the Clue mailout for February 2009 Naismith announced that Stephen Fry, Jack Dee and Rob Brydon would host two shows each, to be recorded in April, May and June 2009 respectively. The programme returned on 15 June 2009, chaired by Fry with the usual panellists and special guest Victoria Wood. Every series since then has been chaired by Dee.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Panellists ===\u000aThe regular panellists for much of the show's history were:\u000aGraeme Garden was a member of the I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again team from which the programme grew and has been a panellist since the first episode. Lyttelton described him as very dry, biding his time before stepping in with a perfect punchline. Garden last appeared in January 2016 and was absent for the whole of series 65, 66 and 67. On 12 October 2017 Garden announced that he would be rejoining the team.\u000aBarry Cryer hosted six episodes in the show's first series before moving to a permanent seat on the panel. He was credited by then-chairman Lyttelton as being the show's "bricks and mortar", providing quick-fire one-liners in any situation. There is a running joke in the programme that he is a dirty old man with a drink problem.\u000aTim Brooke-Taylor was also part of the I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again team and has also been with the show since the start. He is very popular with the crowd and adopts a vulnerable persona. Garden and Brooke-Taylor had previously worked together on television in The Goodies and Brooke-Taylor in particular will occasionally drop references to that show into some of the games, eliciting cheers from the audience.\u000aWillie Rushton was one of the regular panel members from 1974 until his death in 1996. The other panellists have fond memories of his off-the-wall sense of humour and quick-fire puns. Since Rushton's death his seat has been turned into a permanent guest spot. Guests have also appeared when one of the regulars was unavailable.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Producers ===\u000aThe show has had a number of producers over the years:\u000aDavid Hatch (produced only the pilot episode in 1972)\u000aJohn Cassels (1972\u201374)\u000aSimon Brett (1975\u201377)\u000aGeoffrey Perkins (1978\u201381)\u000aPaul Mayhew-Archer (1982\u201386)\u000aPaul Spencer (1987\u201389)\u000aJon Magnusson (1990\u201391)\u000aJon Naismith (1991\u2013present)\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Musical accompaniment ===\u000aEarly episodes featured Dave Lee, who provided piano accompaniment on I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again. However, Colin Sell now usually fills this role. He is often the butt of jokes about his musical ability to which he is unable to respond as he has no microphone. For example: "When music experts hear Colin's compositions, they say he could have been another Berlin, Porter or anybody else employed by the German State Railway." Guest pianists are called in when Sell has been unable to attend (or the ISIHAC team have "won the coin toss" as Lyttelton once said on the show), including Neil Innes, Denis King and Matthew Scott. Lyttelton's band also appeared on a couple of Christmas specials. Once when Innes was guesting Lyttelton outlined the musician's career, concluding that this "has brought him to where he is today: standing in for Colin Sell." In another appearance Innes sang along to his own composition "I'm the Urban Spaceman" during a round of "Pick Up Song".\u000aThe theme music is called "The Schickel Shamble", by Ron Goodwin, and is from the film Monte Carlo or Bust. It was chosen by David Hatch.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Guests ===\u000aGuests have included:\u000aBill Bailey (2002)\u000aMax Boyce (1998)\u000aJo Brand (2009, 2014, 2017)\u000aRory Bremner (2016)\u000aMarcus Brigstocke (2011)\u000aRob Brydon (2006\u201307, 2009, 2011\u201313, 2015)\u000aSusan Calman (2014\u201317)\u000aJohn Cleese (regular panel member during the first series, 1972)\u000aDenise Coffey (1979, 1981, 1983, 1991, 1997)\u000aJack Dee (2004\u201305, 2007)\u000aOmid Djalili (2014\u201315)\u000aPippa Evans (2016)\u000aKenny Everett (1985)\u000aJohn Finnemore (2013\u201314, 2017)\u000aStephen Fry (1986\u201387, 1989, 1997, 2000, 2002, 2007, 2012)\u000aAndy Hamilton (1999, 2001\u201302, 2005\u201307, 2011, 2014, 2017)\u000aMike Harding (1984, 1986)\u000aJeremy Hardy (1995, 1998\u20132007, 2009\u201312, 2015\u201317)\u000aTony Hawks (1995, 1997, 1999\u20132006, 2012\u201317)\u000aHarry Hill (2003, 2005, 2014)\u000aJohn Junkin (1975, 1979, 1986)\u000aPhill Jupitus (1999, 2001, 2009, 2011)\u000aMiles Jupp (2013, 2015\u201317)\u000aJo Kendall (regular panel member during the first series, 1972)\u000aJonathan Lynn (1978)\u000aFred MacAulay (1998\u201399, 2016)\u000aPaul Merton (1991\u201392, 1994, 1997\u201398)\u000aDavid Mitchell (2009\u201311, 2013)\u000aNeil Mullarkey (2000)\u000aRoss Noble (2003, 2005, 2011\u201312)\u000aBill Oddie (regular panel member during the first two series, 1972\u201373)\u000aRichard Osman (2016)\u000aJan Ravens (2017)\u000aLinda Smith (2001, 2004)\u000aBill Tidy (1985, 1989, replacement for Tim Brooke-Taylor for one series in 1991)\u000aSandi Toksvig (1997\u20132005, 2010, 2015\u201316)\u000aVictoria Wood (2009, 2012\u201313)\u000aRaymond Baxter was occasionally drafted to commentate on sessions of Mornington Crescent and also presented the one-off special Everyman's Guide to Mornington Crescent. Both Judi Dench and Alan Titchmarsh took part in "Celebrity What's My Line?". Judi Dench and Michael Gambon performed the Mornington Crescent drama The Bromley by Bow Stratagem. Alan Titchmarsh also played every questioner (that is, famous gardeners) on a 2012 show which featured Victoria Wood. A 2013 episode featured a round of Useless Celebrities, a parody of Pointless Celebrities, and featured Richard Osman as the co-presenter (this was broadcast three years before Osman appeared on the panel). A 2017 episode featured a spoof of The Chase which featured Anne Hegerty, one of the Chasers from the show.\u000aOn one occasion Humph announced that they had a very distinguished actor as a guest who would join in the game of Mornington Crescent. When the game started, after great ceremony, the penultimate player, the last of the panellists, won on his first move, thus denying the distinguished guest the opportunity to make a single move. The chairman apologised but explained that this was an unavoidable possibility and the guest left without having uttered a word. The show was allegedly inundated with complaints at the treatment of Sir Alec Guinness as on the actual recording Lyttelton can be heard to say, "Well I'm very sorry about that. Rather unfortunate. We would like to go on and ask you a few things about what you're doing currently, Sir Alec, but we do have to hurry on to the next game." This story became a favourite of Lyttelton's, who claimed in interviews that the "distinguished actor" had never actually been named on the show.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Scorers ===\u000aSince 18 May 1985 (in the same episode as Kenny Everett made his debut) the show has included a fictional and completely silent scorer "whose job is eased by the fact no points are actually awarded", usually "the lovely Samantha" who sits on Humph's left hand. There is a seat with a microphone next to the Chairman which is "used" by Samantha. During the introductory music Humphrey Lyttelton would stand up and "help" Samantha into her seat. In practice the seat and microphone were only used by the producer to welcome the audience, to introduce the participants and to give any other information to the audience such as the expected date of broadcasting, and to supervise re-recordings of fluffs made in the programme.\u000aLyttelton would describe Samantha's social activities, usually in an apology received from the unseen character who had been detained, often with a "gentleman friend". His comments included innuendo and double entendres, like "Samantha likes nothing better than a little potter in the woodshed in the morning". During early episodes of Samantha's appearance on the show, it was not completely clear that she was a fictional character, garnering complaints about the sexist and humiliating treatment she received. Producer Jon Naismith recalled "when we [Naismith and Iain Pattinson] took over the show we used to get quite a few letters accusing us of sexist references to Samantha" (the character was named after the page 3 topless model Samantha Fox). Samantha's inabilities as score-keeper often form the basis for humour; in a programme from 1997, Humph said: "It's just occurred to me that Samantha hasn't given us the score... since 1981."\u000aSamantha has sometimes been replaced by a Swedish stand-in, Sven, or occasionally another substitute, Monica. When Margaret Thatcher left office in 1990 Lyttelton introduced a scorer named Margaret. In an episode in November 1991 both Samantha and Sven were present but occupied with each other and unable to award points.\u000aThe programme's scoring is completely nonexistent. Similarly, in rounds such as "Sound charades", where one team of panellists have to guess the charade of the other team, the answer may be obvious (usually a pun) but the opposing team pretends it is cryptic and they have no idea and deliberately guess wrongly.\u000aIn rounds in which the panel must not see what the audience sees, there is the "advanced laser display-board" (actually a sign with the answer written on, held by Jon Naismith), sometimes described in more elaborate terms and "so generously funded by our hosts" but these of course do not exist: they are conveyed to "listeners at home" by the "mystery voice", alluding to the 1960s radio programme Twenty Questions.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Correspondence ===\u000aA regular feature on the programme, preceding the game Mornington Crescent, is a fictional letters section which begins with the chairman's comments ("I notice from the sheer weight of this week's postbag, we've received a little over no letters" and "I see from the number of letters raining down on us this week that the Scrabble factory has exploded again"). The invariably single letter each week is from "A Mrs Trellis of North Wales", one of the many prompts for a cheer from the audience, whose incoherent letters usually mistake the chairman for another Radio 4 presenter or media personality. "Dear Libby" (she writes), "why oh why ... very nearly spells YOYO", or "Dear Mr Titchmarsh, never let them tell you that size isn't important. My aunt told me that, but then all my new wallpaper fell off."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Format ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Introduction ===\u000aThe chairman introduces the show with remarks such as:\u000a\u000a"Hello and welcome to I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue. Tonight, we promise you a nail-biting contest. Which will be followed by a nose-picking contest."\u000a\u000aand continues by providing a little background material, usually derogatory, about the show's location:\u000a\u000a"Hastings joined with Romney, Hythe, Dover and Sandwich to form a brotherhood of coastal towns in 1067, intended to defend England from any cross-Channel invasion; they took the crest of a running horse rampant and stable door bolted."\u000a\u000aThen the teams' introduction:\u000a\u000a"The Dorset coast is also famous for its sedimentary deposits dating from the Eocene Age, and the curious still come here in search of fossils and even obscure little-known dinosaurs...Let's meet the teams..."\u000a\u000aThe teams are often mocked at their introduction:\u000a\u000a"As I introduce the teams today I must say we couldn't have asked for four better comedians. So that's answered your next question..."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Games ===\u000a\u000aMany games are played on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, some frequently and dozens less often. A few have only been played once either because the joke only works once or because the result was not particularly successful. Popular games include "One Song to the Tune of Another", "Mornington Crescent", "Sound Charades", "Late Arrivals", "Double Feature", "Cheddar Gorge" and "Uxbridge English Dictionary". "One Song to the Tune of Another" is always introduced using a complex analogy, despite its self-explanatory title, often ending with a joke at the expense of Colin Sell.\u000aThe panellists play as individuals or as two teams. "Celebrity What's My Line?" completely destroyed the intent of the original \u2014 for players to guess the occupation of a third party by asking yes/no questions. The I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue version once employed the famous actress (and fan of the show) Dame Judi Dench in this role and the renowned television gardener Alan Titchmarsh. Each began by performing a mime illustrating their occupation, giving a cryptic clue to the panel (appearing to a radio listener as a short silence punctuated by exclamations from the panel and laughter from the studio audience), before fielding apparently serious questions from the teams (e.g. "Is that your own hair?" or "Do you kill people for money?"), who pretended not to know who they were.\u000aMusical games often involve incongruities such as singing "One Song to the Tune of Another" or playing a song using only a swanee whistle and a kazoo. In "Just a Minim" \u2013 a parody of Radio 4's Just a Minute \u2013 panellists must sing a specified song avoiding repetition, deviation, or hesitation: the chosen songs often have extremely repetitive lyrics.\u000aHumour is derived from wordplay such as puns or mockery of styles of speech. For example, in a round based on suggesting television programmes from biblical times:\u000aThey Think It's All Jehovah\u000aI Love Lucifer\u000aThe Exodus Files\u000aIn "Uxbridge English Dictionary" the panellists contribute humorous redefinitions of words; "Puny: the Roman Catholic equivalent of tennis elbow". More puns are found in the "Arrivals at the Ball" section, of the form "Mr and Mrs X and their son (or daughter)...." the child's name forming a pun, preferably laboured and feeble. This grew out of the "drama" section of later shows in the I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again series, for example, at the Criminals' Ball, "Mr and Mrs Knee, and their Swedish son, Lars Knee".\u000aAccording to Tim Brooke-Taylor twenty per cent of the show is ad-libbed. According to Willie Rushton, it is more like fifty per cent, but he didn't think that a bad thing.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Time, destiny, fate and eternity ===\u000aThe show draws to a close with the chairman imparting some final words of wisdom intended to evoke time, destiny, fate and eternity, undercut with silliness. For example: "...And so, as the hunter of time blasts the moose of eternity, and the dairy counter worker of fate sighs and grabs her mop..." Lyttelton's final sign-off on the show, shortly before his death in April 2008, was: "And so as the loose-bowelled pigeon of time swoops low over the unsuspecting tourist of destiny, and the flatulent skunk of fate wanders into the air-conditioning system of eternity, I notice it's the end of the show."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Humour ==\u000aMost of the humour is detached from the real world. Steve Punt cites it as one of his favourite radio shows because "there's no points being made or targets being attacked." Contemporary references occasionally made by participants are usually asides. The show does occasionally comment on the outside world, though from an innocent perspective. The game "Complete George Bush Quotes" was once played, in which the teams had to supply endings for phrases that George Bush had begun (see Bushism), the teams complaining that they couldn't be any funnier than the original.\u000aAt the close of one show, the chairman asked the teams to read the cuttings that they had brought along with them, in the manner of fellow Radio 4 show The News Quiz. The teams proceeded to read their cuttings, but only to themselves, followed some interested murmurs from the teams and much laughter from the audience.\u000aSelf-deprecation forms a big part of the show's humour. It frequently pokes fun at itself and its supposed low quality. For example, Lyttelton was heard to exclaim at the end of a round:\u000a"Nietzsche said that life was a choice between suffering and boredom. He never said anything about having to put up with both at the same time."\u000a"I'm often prone to bouts of misplaced optimism. This round's going to be a hum-dinger!"\u000a"All good things must come to an end, so let's carry on."\u000aAn introduction to "Sound Charades", a round based on Give Us a Clue, went: "In the TV version the teams were not allowed to speak, making the games both silent and hilarious. Our version differs in just two ways."\u000aAccording to Willie Rushton, "The show gets quite filthy at times, but the audience love it." After over forty years on the air one of the most important aspects of the show is its huge stock of running gags which, if not always funny in themselves, can elicit huge anticipatory laughter from the studio audience. The mere mention of Lionel Blair will often bring roars of laughter in anticipation of an outrageous double-entendre based on his supposed homosexuality (he is not gay). In the "Film Club" round any reference by Graeme Garden to Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia is sure to cause a similar response. The game "Wobbling Bunnies" was introduced several times by Humph, often with eager anticipation by the panel and audience, but time pressures always meant the game was never actually played. Graeme Garden and Barry Cryer frequently play the characters of two Scots, Hamish and Dougal, whose skits usually begin with the phrase "You'll have had your tea, then, Dougal?", as a stereotypical Scots miser when receiving a guest never offers any food or drink. The characters were developed into their own Radio 4 show, Hamish and Dougal. Another long-running gag involves one of the panellists putting forward a challenge of "hesitation" when another panellist leaves a long pause in the middle of speaking, a reference to Radio 4's other long-running panel show Just a Minute. (Likewise, occasionally on Just a Minute, a panellist will make a challenge of "Mornington Crescent".) Chairman Jack Dee frequently pokes fun at Just a Minute, particularly its chairman Nicholas Parsons, whom he mimics in constantly emphasising the long experience of some panellists, and the fact that the programme can be heard all over the world.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Awards ==\u000aThe programme has won the Gold Sony Radio Comedy Award three times:\u000a1995: featuring Humphrey Lyttelton, Barry

The film was later listed among Corliss's "Guilty Pleasures" as a postscript to Time Magazine's list of "All-Time 100 best films."  In his essay, Corliss described the film as a "mini-masterpiece", offering that the film was "a funny, telling comment on how directors bring an audience's gamiest desires to life, and on how power helps define any human relationship." Corliss later wrote that the film was the "friendliest, most naturalistic porno I know" and that it was "a lovely, and hot, demonstration of the thesis that sex is power".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Controversy ==\u000aThe film was the subject of litigation, being declared obscene and its distribution in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 and 1462 (1976).

aVTerrence Hardiman (born 6 April 1937) is an English actor. He is best known for playing The Demon Headmaster in the children's television series of the same name, and also for portraying Luftwaffe Police Major Reinhardt in the 1970s drama series Secret Army.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aBorn in Forest Gate, Essex, Hardiman is often seen playing authority figures, and has played Nazi era German military personnel (Secret Army, Colditz, Wish Me Luck and Enemy at the Door) and British officers (When the Boat Comes In), police inspectors (Juliet Bravo and Softly, Softly), doctors (Home to Roost, The Royal), barristers (Crown Court and The Brittas Empire), judges (The Bill and The Courtroom), Father Abbot Radulfus (Cadfael), and of course an evil headmaster (The Demon Headmaster). He also played Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, in Richard Attenborough's Gandhi.\u000aHardiman's television work has included him playing barrister Stephen Harvestey in Granada Television's Crown Court from 1972 to 1983. Hardiman's portrayal of Major Reinhardt, in Secret Army, the (fictional) head of the Luftwaffe (German Air force) police, often provided a foil to Clifford Rose's more brutal S.S. Chief, Kessler.\u000aAs with many of the characters in Secret Army, Reinhardt was not a one dimensional villain, but a rounded character who often questioned his own motives and methods. The actor's portrayal allowed the viewer to sympathise with this character. In 1990, he played a two dimensional German officer, General Stuckler, in the final series of London Weekend Television's Wish Me Luck.\u000aHardiman starred as the eponymous The Demon Headmaster in the children's television drama series, which ran to three series from 1996 to 1998, and proved popular with adults as well as children.\u000aHe also had a starring role as Charles Pooter in the 1979 television adaptation of George and Weedon Grossmith's Diary of a Nobody, a role which shows his versatility more than the succession of officers he usually portrays. Hardiman's other recurring role was as Brother Cadfael's ecclesiastical superior, Abbot Radulfus, in the television series. Joining him throughout the series as Prior Robert was Michael Culver, who had played his predecessor Major Brandt in Secret Army.\u000aAn notable small role Hardiman played was a version of the Sergeant Wilson character from Dad's Army, in an episode of time travel comedy Goodnight Sweetheart, called "Don't Get Around Much Any More", in which Nicholas Lyndhurst's character Gary Sparrow goes back in time to a bank in the 1940s, and encounters characters called Mainwaring and Wilson. Hardiman's portrayal was a keenly observed impersonation of John Le Mesurier's own performance, incorporating many of the tics and mannerisms of the original.\u000aHardiman also appeared as Grand Wizard Egbert Hellibore in four episodes of The Worst Witch. Hardiman appeared in the second series of The Worst Week of My Life. Another notable recent role was as a devious Swiss murder victim in an episode of crime mystery series Jonathan Creek.\u000aHe made an appearance on the daily soap on BBC One, Doctors, on 3 April 2009, as well as from 14 to 15 January 2015, and in the drama from Yorkshire, Heartbeat, as John Upton in one episode. In 2009, he appeared in a film for the BFI, Radio Mania: An Abandoned Work, directed by British artists Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard. The film was based on The Man from M.A.R.S. (1922). Hardiman appeared as Hawthorne in the episode of Doctor Who, "The Beast Below", on 10 April 2010.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected filmography ==\u000aRunning Scared (1972) as Doctor\u000aPope Joan (1972) as Cardinal Anastasius\u000aLoophole (1981) as David\u000aThe Bunker (1981) as Hermann Fegelein\u000aGandhi (1982) as Ramsay MacDonald\u000aSahara (1983) as Browne\u000aGod's Outlaw (1986) as Thomas Cromwell\u000aMask of Murder (1988) as Dr. Paul Crossland\u000aDistant Shadow (2000) as The Svit\u000aFishtales (2007) as Professor Ratcher\u000aMr. Turner (2014) as Gallery Visitors\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aTerrence Hardiman on IMDb\u000aUnofficial Terrence Hardiman website

aV"Brave Heart" is the sixth episode of the sixth season of House. It aired on October 19, 2009.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000aA police officer, Donny Compson, and his partner are chasing a man who continuously evades them using Parkour techniques, eventually leading the chase to a rooftop. Donny attempts to leap from building to building in pursuit, but falls short and plummets to the ground.\u000aIn the hospital, Donny reveals that his great-grandfather, his grandfather, and his father have all died of a mysterious heart disease shortly after reaching the age of 40. This leads the team to investigate, despite House's insistence that it's merely a coincidence. Chase and Foreman begin performing a battery of tests to look for genetic diseases and examine his ancestors' remains, but find nothing. House eventually fools the patient into believing he has an imaginary disease (Ortolli syndrome) and discharges him after giving him mints as a "treatment" for his illness. However, a few hours later Foreman tells House that Donny had suddenly died while doing his laundry.\u000aDuring the patient's autopsy he bleeds and suddenly awakens, obviously alive, which leads the team to readmit him and to try to find the reason for his illness and "miraculous" resurrection. House eventually solves the case, with the solution being that the patient had an intracranial berry aneurysm in the brain stem which applied pressure on various nerves, leading to the patient's symptoms, including the "stopping" of his heart.\u000aSide stories include House hearing whispering in odd places, which turn out to be Wilson whispering to Amber at night. Chase, who cannot get over Dibala's death, is unable to enter the ICU. At House's behest, Chase finally seeks a priest for help who tells him that the right thing to do would be to turn himself in. Ignoring the priest's advice, Chase tries to drink his troubles away. Cameron is seen phoning the police as Chase walks in late, and goes away on her own when Chase still will not tell her the reason for his odd behavior.\u000aAt the very end, House speaks to his father about focusing on the wrong thing and then yells to Wilson, whom he knows will be listening on the other side of the wall. Wilson replies to his dead girlfriend, "see, he really is getting better".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Music ==\u000a"Set Me Free" by: Monotonix\u000a"Faithfully Remain" by: Ben Harper\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a"Brave Heart" on IMDb\u000aHouse - Episode 6.05 - Brave Heart Recap

aVJustine Henin and Kim Clijsters are Belgian professional tennis players who engaged in a long-standing rivalry which spanned twenty-five meetings over a twelve-year period, with eight taking place in a Grand Slam tournament. Their final competitive meeting came at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships in the fourth round, with Clijsters winning in 3 sets, this brought their head to head record to 13\u201312 in Clijsters' favour. The Belgians have met eight times in Grand Slam tournaments, three of which were finals. Henin leads 5\u20133 in Grand Slam play including winning all their final match-ups.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History of the rivalry ==\u000aThey first met in 1998 with Henin winning in Ramat HaSharon. 2001 was a historic year for the pair. Their first match was decided in the final set at Indian Wells in the third round which Clijsters won. At the French Open the tournament witnessed Clijsters and Henin facing off in the semifinals, where the winner would create history and become Belgium's first ever singles Grand Slam finalist. Clijsters created history by winning the match in three sets before losing an epic contest to Jennifer Capriati in the final. Just two weeks later though Henin beat Clijsters in three sets to win the Heineken Open. In November the pair teamed up to bring Belgium its first success in the Fed Cup competition.\u000aClijsters won in straight sets in both Sydney and the Australian Open quarterfinals at the start of 2002. Henin won only her second match in six meetings against Clijsters in the semifinals of Rome. In their final match of 2002 at the WTA Championships, Clijsters lost just three games to Henin.\u000aAt the Adidas International in the first of eight matches between the pair in 2003, Clijsters saw off Henin\u2013Hardenne in straight sets to reach the final against Lindsay Davenport, which Clijsters won. The pair's next meeting came in the semifinals of their home event, the Proximus Diamond Games, with Clijsters again winning in straight sets before falling to Venus Williams in the final. Henin\u2013Hardenne hit back to win her first match of the year against Clijsters in Berlin. As Clijsters wasted three match points as Henin won the match in the final set 7\u20135. Henin then squared the series up for the year as she lost just four games to Clijsters as she won the French Open. Just two weeks later Clijsters stopped the two-game losing streak as Henin retired from the final of the Ordina Open. The pair's next meeting was at the Acura Classic with Henin fighting back from a set down to defeat her compatriot. Henin went on to claim her second Grand Slam title of the year, defeating Clijsters in straight sets at the US Open. In their final match of the year the World Number One was at stake as they faced off in Germany. It was Clijsters who was the reigning World Number One who claimed it as she defeated Henin, coming from a set down to do so.\u000aThe Belgians met just once in 2004 and 2005, at the opening Grand Slam Tournament of 2004, the Australian Open. Again it was in the final and again Henin triumphed in the final set. It was a year and a half before they met again, this time in the final of the Rogers Cup, and Clijsters defeated Henin-Hardenne, whilst in the middle of a 22-match winning streak. The rivalry came to an end in 2006 as Clijsters retired in 2007, but not before three more matches were played. 2006 witnessed Henin defeating Clijsters in all three matches. Henin won in straight sets at the French Open and at Wimbledon, but needed three sets to get rid of her rival at Eastbourne. Wimbledon was the last match they played and it left Henin winning the series by 12 matches to 10. Also in 2006 Clijsters and Henin guided their nation to the final of the Fed Cup where they lost. Clijsters and Henin only played in the first round together; all other rounds Kirsten Flipkens played, partnering Clijsters in the semifinals and Henin in the final.\u000aHenin then followed suit and retired in 2008, but in 2009, Clijsters came out of retirement and Henin followed for the start of the 2010 season, reigniting the rivalry. Henin met Clijsters in the final at Brisbane in her first tournament back, which Clijsters finally won in the final set tiebreak. They then met in Miami and shared another match which went to the final set tie-break again. Clijsters then defeated Henin in three sets while at Wimbledon, while Henin injured her elbow during the first set, as Clijsters took the renewed rivalry score to 3\u20130. The pair were considering putting their fierce rivalry aside to compete together in the doubles of the 2012 Olympic Games. But the rivalry was ended when Henin retired once again, this time on doctors' advice because of the elbow injury sustained against Clijsters at Wimbledon, after playing the 2011 Australian Open, leaving the final head-to-head 13\u201312 in Clijsters' favour. The pair's final match together was an exhibition in Antwerp in December 2010 with Clijsters winning a match tiebreaker.\u000aDuring the height of their rivalry in 2003, Clijsters openly accused Henin in media for poor sportsmanship and taking advantage by asking for a medical treatment when Henin was behind in their tennis matches. Clijsters stated that Henin often faked her injuries to distract her opponents. In 2011, after her second retirement, Henin talked about the controversial moment during their 2004 Australian Open final, when a Clisjters' forehand swing volley on break point at 3-4 in the third set was incorrectly overruled.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Head-to-head ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Clijsters-Henin (13\u201312) ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Breakdown of the rivalry ==\u000aHard courts: Clijsters, 8\u20134\u000aClay courts: Henin, 5\u20131\u000aGrass courts: Henin, 3\u20132\u000aIndoor Carpet: Clijsters, 2\u20130\u000aGrand Slam matches: Henin, 5\u20133\u000aGrand Slam finals: Henin, 3\u20130\u000aYear-End Championships matches: Clijsters, 1\u20130\u000aYear-End Championships finals: None\u000aFed Cup matches: None; They are unable to play each other in a Fed Cup match because they both represent Belgium.\u000aAll finals: Henin, 7\u20134\u000a\u000a\u000a== WTA Rankings ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Year-end ranking timeline ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of tennis rivalries\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aClijsters-Henin rivalry preview 2010 Wimbledon

A number of clubs took on Anglicised names, such as league rivals Montevideo Wanderers; in this case, the team paid homage to Liverpool FC.\u000aFor the 2005\u201306 season, the away kit changed to a new all red one, thus looking exactly like the English Liverpool FC.

Due to the bridge's low height, there is no pavement on the section of the road underneath the bridge. The remainder of the road, however, is paved. In 2000, under the direction of Prince Edward Island Director of Transportation, Gail Shea, an identical bridge in nearby Harper Road was demolished and the trail was lowered to road level. Protests were made to do the same in Ascension, and the bridge in Ascension remains the only one on Prince Edward Island.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other information ==\u000aAscension Road is a secondary highway in Prince Edward Island, and is one of the busiest secondary highways in the Tignish area.

aVWalkabout is a novel written by James Vance Marshall, first published in 1959 as The Children. It is about two children who get lost in the Australian Outback and are helped by an Aborigine on his walkabout. A film based on the book, with the same title came out in 1971, but deviated from the original plot.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot summary ==\u000aThe book opens with two American siblings, Peter and Mary, in a gully in the Australian outback. They are lost as a result of a plane crash. Peter says they should seek out their uncle, who lives in Adelaide; Mary agrees and they begin walking across the desert, but they don't know that it is across the other side.\u000aThe next day they keep walking and searching for food but their efforts are in vain. Suddenly, an Aborigine appears and startles them, mostly due to his nudity. Hoping to make him leave, Mary glares at him. This proves ineffective. Hoping to find out about the strangers, he inspects both of them but finds nothing of interest, so he leaves.\u000aPeter and Mary, shocked at losing their only hope for survival, follow him. Peter attempts to communicate with him through gestures of eating and drinking and the Aborigine comprehends their situation. He indicates that they should follow him, which they do. He arrives at a waterhole where the children drink their fill. Then, the Aborigine prepares food for the hungry children. After this, he begins to lead the children to the next waterhole.\u000aThe problems of the lack of communication shows clearly in this book. The Aborigine misreads Mary's look of disgust at his nakedness and thinks she has seen the spirit of death and is about to die soon and falls into a mental euthanasia.\u000aWhen the trio arrived at the next waterhole, the symptoms of the flu Peter has unwittingly passed on to him start to show in the Aborigine. He begins to worry and decides he must tell the children he needs a burial platform to keep bad spirits from his body and to keep the snakes from "molesting his body" after his death. Peter is gathering firewood so to avoid interrupting a man at work, the Aborigine seeks Mary who is bathing. The Aborigine doesn't see a bath as something private; he arrives at the pool and Mary is terrified; she begins to threaten the Aborigine with snarls and a rock. He is confused and becomes depressed, believing that he will not have his burial platform.\u000aMary goes to Peter and tells him to leave with her but Peter is concerned about the Aborigine so Mary is forced to stay. Peter tells her that the Aborigine is very sick; he realizes that the Aborigine could die while Mary refuses to believe that the flu could be fatal, not understanding the native boy's fear of the Spirit of Death he believes she saw in him. Soon, Mary goes to investigate. Finally, she acknowledges that he is actually dying and forgives him. She lays his head in her lap and he touches her hair. Mary realizes that they are not so different, despite his appearance and language. He dies later in the night. They bury him and leave for the food and water-filled valley Peter was told about by the Aborigine before he died.\u000aThey stop at a pool where they eat some yabbies, observe platypus and leave. In a valley rich in water, food, and wildlife, they survive for many days with the skills learned from the Aborigine. They also discover some wet clay which they use to draw pictures: Peter draws nature while Mary draws stylish women and her dream house. Eventually, the children see smoke and see Aboriginal swimmers. One of the swimmers, a man, sees the drawings. His son owns a "warrigal", or pet dog, which serves as a link between the boy and Peter. The father sees Mary's dream house and realizes Mary and Peter seek civilization. In a wide variety of gestures and drawings, he tells the children that there is a house like that across the hills and demonstrates how to reach there. The overjoyed children begin their trek back to civilization.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reception ==\u000aIt is by far Vance's most popular work, due in large part to the success of the related film. Reviewers have praised Walkabout for its detailed and accurate descriptions of the Australian environment.\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aSummary and Teacher's notes (pdf)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe DDZ Bridge over New Fork River is a Kingpost pony truss bridge located near Boulder, Wyoming, which carries Sublette County Road 136 across the New Fork River. The bridge was built in 1917 by Lincoln County's government, as Sublette County had not yet been formed. Unlike most truss bridges at the time, the bridge was built with timber trusses rather than steel; it is the only wooden two-span Kingpost truss bridge remaining in Wyoming. The bridge's construction is considered to be "the most sophisticated" of extant wooden truss bridges in the state.\u000aThe bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 22, 1985. It was one of several bridges added to the NRHP for its role in the history of Wyoming bridge construction.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aPhotos from the NRHP nomination\u000aNew Fork River Bridge, County Road 136, Boulder vicinity, Sublette, WY at the Historic American Engineering Record (HAER)

aVAmerican Ninja Warrior (sometimes abbreviated as ANW) is an American sports entertainment competition that is a spin-off of the Japanese television series Sasuke. It features hundreds of competitors attempting to complete a series of obstacle courses of increasing difficulty, trying to make it to the national finals on the Las Vegas Strip, in hopes of becoming an "American Ninja Warrior". To date only two competitors, rock-climbers Isaac Caldiero and Geoff Britten, have won the course and achieved "Total Victory". Caldiero is the only competitor to win the cash prize. The series began on the now-defunct cable channel G4 and now airs on NBC with encore episodes airing on USA Network and NBC Sports Network.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aAmerican Ninja Warrior succeeded G4's American Ninja Challenge as the qualifying route for Americans to enter Sasuke. Beginning with the fourth season in 2012, regional finalists and wild card competitors competed on a nearly identical Mount Midoriyama course in Las Vegas, Nevada, rather than traveling to Japan to compete on Sasuke.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Hosts and co-hosts ==\u000aAmerican Ninja Warrior was originally hosted by G4's American television personality Blair Herter, and actress and former television correspondent Alison Haislip. In the second season, American actor, comedian, and television host Matt Iseman joined the show, replacing Herter. Additionally, Jimmy Smith was brought in as a co-host, while Haislip was the sideline reporter. The panel remained the same throughout season three.\u000aFor season 4, skier Jonny Moseley was brought in as the new co-host, replacing Smith. American journalist, sportscaster, and documentary filmmaker Angela Sun replaced Haislip.\u000aFor season 5, two newcomers were added. Sports analyst and former NFL football player Akbar Gbaja-Biamila replaced Moseley, while ESPN sportscaster and model Jenn Brown replaced Sun as sideline reporter. The season five panel remained the same through the sixth season.\u000aFor season 7, CBS Sports reporter Kristine Leahy joined the show as the new sideline reporter, replacing Brown. The roster stayed the same through season 9. The current panel consists of Iseman, Gbaja-Biamila, and Leahy.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Timeline ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Format ==\u000aPotential contestants go through a rigorous series of steps before the possibility of becoming the next American Ninja Warrior. Over 3,500 athletes have attempted to conquer Mount Midoriyama and become an American Ninja Warrior since the series began in 2009.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Contestant eligibility ===\u000aThere are some requirements possible contestants have to meet before participating at a regional qualifier. Contestants must be legal residents of the US and be in decent physical shape. There is no upper age limit, but participants must be at least 19 years old (during the first 9 seasons, it was 21 years old). Contestants have to fill out a 20-page questionnaire and make a video about themselves. The required length of the video has differed over the years. Submission video length requirements have varied from 2 to 8 minutes, depending on the season. Producers select 100 applicants from each region to participate in their regional qualifiers. Producers also select 20 to 30 "walk-ons" who in some cases wait for weeks camping outside to get a chance on the course. 1,000 people applied to compete in season one, 5,000 people in season 6, 50,000 in season 7, and 70,000 in season 8.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== City qualifying ===\u000aIn each city, the competitors that the producers have selected compete on a 6 - obstacle course in hopes of making it to the city finals. The top 30 finishers make it to the city finals. Also, in Season 9, the top 5 women make it. The first obstacle is the quintuple steps or the floating steps and is the same for the rest of the cities for that season. Then comes an obstacle that moves along tracks. Next is either a balance obstacle or an upper-body obstacle. The other type will be fourth. Fifth is usually a grip obstacle, and sixth is the Warped Wall. In Season 9, the balance or the grip obstacle is an obstacle previously found in Stage 1 of Mount Midoryama. The obstacles are given by the sideline reporter at the beginning of every episode.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== City timeline ====\u000a\u000a\u000a=== City finals ===\u000aCity finals courses are the follow-up to each city qualifying course. Qualifying and finals courses are filmed back-to-back, usually over two days. The top 15 finishers overall from each city finals course move on to compete in the National Finals. In addition, as of season 9, the top two women in each city finals are guaranteed to advance, even if they do not finish in the top 15. Small prizes ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 are awarded to first, second, and third finishers who complete the finals course.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Mount Midoriyama ===\u000aMount Midoriyama is the finals course for American Ninja Warrior. Located on the Las Vegas strip, it consists of four stages, each containing various obstacles of increasing difficulty. Competitors must complete all of the 23 obstacles. Should they complete the first three stages, competitors will advance to Stage 4, where competitors attempt to climb the 75-foot rope climb, known as Mount Midoriyama, in 30 seconds or less. Should a competitor achieve Total Victory, he or she receives a money prize of $500,000 from season 4 to season 6, and $1,000,000 from season 7. Beginning in season 8, if multiple competitors complete stage 4, the competitors split the prize money, although in prior years the fastest competitor would receive the full amount.\u000aStage 1 consists of obstacles that test the competitors' agility and speed. The first stage is timed, and only the competitors who successfully complete it within the time limit of 2:30 advance to Stage 2.\u000aStage 2 consists of obstacles that test the competitors' strength and speed. Competitors must complete challenges that strain their upper-body strength (such as the Salmon Ladder) without running out of time. Just as in the first stage, only the competitors who successfully finish within the time limit of 4:00 move on to Stage 3.\u000aStage 3 consists of obstacles that test the competitors' upper body and grip strength. It is the only stage in Mt. Midoriyama that has no time limit. Like Stages 1 and 2, only the competitors who successfully complete Stage 3 move on.\u000aStage 4 of Mt. Midoriyama is a 75-foot rope climb. Competitors must complete the rope climb and hit the buzzer in under 30 seconds.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Series overview and season synopses ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Season 1 (2009) ===\u000aThe first season of American Ninja Warrior was held in Los Angeles, where hundreds of competitors came to challenge themselves against the course and qualify for a shot at making it to Japan to compete in Sasuke 23 later in the year. The special premiered on December 12, 2009, on G4 TV and was hosted by G4's Blair Herter and Alison Haislip. Notable competitors this season included freerunners Levi Meeuwenberg and Brian Orosco, mixed martial artist Jason "Mayhem" Miller, and Hollywood stuntman Rich King.\u000aOut of the ten Americans who qualified to compete at Mount Midori in Japan, only Rich King, Levi Meeuwenberg and Brian Orosco successfully completed Stage 1. The majority of the American Ninja Warrior competitors ran out of time or failed the obstacles. Levi Meeuwenberg was the only American competitor to complete Stage 2. The sole American competitor on Stage 3, he fell on the "Shin-Cliffhanger", and his run came to an end.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Season 2 (2010) ===\u000a\u000aThe second season premiered on December 8, 2010, on G4 and concluded on January 2, 2011. It began in Venice Beach, California, where 300 competitors took on the course. The 15 semi-finalists moved on to the "Ninja Warrior Boot Camp" in the remote California mountains, where they competed in a series of team challenges. Then the finalists moved on to compete in the season finale of American Ninja Warrior 2 as a part of Sasuke 26 at Mount Midori in Japan. No competitor made it beyond Stage 3.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Season 3 (2011) ===\u000a\u000aThe third season began airing on July 31, 2011, on G4 and concluded with the finale airing on August 22, 2011, as a two-hour primetime special on NBC. Tryouts took place in May 2011 at Venice Beach, California. After the tryouts, the top 15 competitors competed in Ninja Warrior Boot Camp with the top 10 moving on to Japan for the finals of the competition as a part of Sasuke 27 and a chance at becoming the first American to conquer the course and win a $500,000 endorsement deal with K-Swiss. No competitors made it beyond Stage 3.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Season 4 (2012) ===\u000a\u000aThe fourth season of American Ninja Warrior began airing on May 20, 2012, on both G4 and NBC. There were six regional competitions held in three locations: Venice Beach (Southwest and Northwest), Dallas (Midwest and Midsouth), and Miami (Northeast and Southeast), that determined the 100 competitors to participate in the qualifying rounds. The winner of the ANW season 4 competition would receive $500,000 and the coveted "American Ninja Warrior" title. The season finale, held in Las Vegas, was the first time that Mount Midori was held on U.S. soil. Submission videos for American Ninja Warrior season 4 had been collected since January 25, 2012.\u000aThe entire format was changed as well \u2013 regional qualifiers in different parts of the country were aired, and the Mt. Midori course was recreated just off the Las Vegas Strip for the national finals. The regional qualifiers would narrow down its selections down to 30 contestants who finished its qualifying course in the fastest time as well as the contestants who finished the furthest the fastest. Qualifying obstacles would include common Stage 1 obstacles such as the Quintuple steps and the Warped wall, but its contents would change from city to city. The 30 contestants were then cut in half in the regional finals where the course would extend to include common Stage 2 and Stage 3 obstacles such as the Salmon Ladder, Cliffhanger and Body Prop. The 100 contestants who qualified (including wild cards) earned tickets to Las Vegas to challenge Mt. Midori. Brent Steffensen was the first American to defeat the Ultimate Cliffhanger on Stage 3, and he made it the farthest that season, falling on the Hang Climb. He was the only competitor to reach Stage 3 in this competition.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Season 5 (2013) ===\u000a\u000aThe fifth season of American Ninja Warrior premiered on June 30, 2013, on G4 with subsequent shows airing on NBC and G4. Notably, the sideboard advertising along the course listed Esquire Network as the broadcaster as the fifth season was to premiere after G4's transition to Esquire on April 22, 2013. The network switch was eventually delayed to September 23, 2013, and Esquire took over Style Network's channel space instead. Because of this, additional reruns of the season aired on Saturday nights on NBC through the summer to maintain ratings momentum due to G4's lame duck status, with ANW being their only new program since they wound down all their original programming in January 2013. The success of the NBC re-airings led to the series being considered for NBC's main summer schedule for the next season.\u000aRegional competitions were held in Venice Beach, Baltimore, Miami, and Denver. Tryouts for the season began in February 2013 and ended with the last of the regional rounds taking place the following May. The finale was once again held in Las Vegas. No one defeated Stage 3, but Brian Arnold fell on the last obstacle, the Flying Bar, making him the farthest-going American on the Mount Midori course since Kane Kosugi reached the final stage on Sasuke 8.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Season 6 (2014) ===\u000a\u000aThe sixth season of American Ninja Warrior premiered on May 26, 2014, on NBC with subsequent shows airing on Monday nights at 9:00 pm EST and Tuesday nights at 8:00 pm EST on Esquire Network. Regional competitions were held at Venice Beach, Dallas, St. Louis, Miami, and Denver. The season finale was again held in Las Vegas, the permanent home of the U.S. version of Mount Midori. Notable competitors this season included The Biggest Loser personal trainer Kim Lyons, U.S. Olympic gymnasts Jonathan Horton and Terin Humphrey, among others. Female competitor Kacy Catanzaro became the first female to make it up the "Warped Wall" in the Dallas Qualifiers. Later in the Dallas Finals, she became the first woman to complete that finals course, in 8 minutes, 59 seconds. Again, no competitor achieved "total victory". Kacy's run has over ten million views. Joe Moravsky, the "Weatherman", made it farther than anyone on Season 6, falling on the Hang Climb, where Brent Steffensen failed two years ago.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Season 7 (2015) ===\u000a\u000aThe seventh season of American Ninja Warrior premiered on NBC on May 25, 2015. This season's grand prize was increased from $500,000 to $1,000,000. Qualifying and finals courses were held in Venice Beach, Kansas City, Houston, Orlando, Pittsburgh, as well as a special military-only course in San Pedro. Stage 1 had a total of 38 finishers including Brent Steffensen and Dustin McKinney. In Stage 2, 30 of the 38 competitors failed. Only eight were remaining in Stage 3 including Drew Dreschel, Abel Gonzalez, Isaac Caldiero, Ian Dory, Jeremiah Morgan, Kevin Bull, Joe Moravsky and Geoff Britten. Only two competitors finished the course: Isaac Caldiero and Geoff Britten. It was the first time that any American had finished Stage 3. The season concluded with a victory: Geoff Britten was the first to complete Stage 4 with a second remaining; however, Isaac Caldiero achieved the Stage 4 rope climb in a faster time and was awarded the grand prize of $1,000,000 and the title of "American Ninja Warrior". Geoff Britten was the first Ninja to complete all six courses in a single season.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Season 8 (2016) ===\u000a\u000aSeason 8 of American Ninja Warrior began on June 1, 2016, on NBC, with encore episodes airing the following day on Esquire Network. Regional competitions were held in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Indianapolis, Oklahoma City, and Philadelphia, with 28 new obstacles. Over 40 percent more women registered for season 8 compared to the previous season. Additionally, prize money for possible Stage 4 winners would now be split equally among competitors who complete the rope climb in under 30 seconds.\u000aIn Philadelphia's city finals, no competitors completed the finals course, a first in American Ninja Warrior history. In Stage 1 of the National Finals, many veterans of the show such as Geoff Britten and Brent Steffensen were eliminated early, while Jessie Graff became the first woman to complete Stage 1, placing fifth. Tyler Yamauchi became the shortest person ever to complete the Jumping Spider obstacle at 5'1". Only 17 competitors successfully completed Stage 1, the lowest in ANW history. On Stage 2, all athletes were eliminated except Drew Drechsel and Daniel Gil. During Stage 3, both Drechsel and Gil could not complete the course. Gil fell on the Ultimate Cliffhanger, while Drechsel went the farthest, but fell on the Hang Climb. Contrary to season 7's multiple winners, no season 8 competitor was even able to complete Stage 3.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Season 9 (2017) ===\u000a\u000aSeason 9 of American Ninja Warrior began on June 12, 2017, on NBC; Esquire Network ended operations fifteen days later on June 27, thus encore episodes shifted over to NBCSN on non-event nights with this season. The premiere was preceded by a special episode, "Celebrity Ninja Warrior" on May 25, 2017, the U.S. Red Nose Day, which was followed by a "USA vs. the World" special on June 4. New for season 9, the top five women in each city qualifying course qualified for the city finals course, and the top two women in each city finals qualified for national finals, regardless of their placement overall. Also this season, fans were given the opportunity to design their own obstacles through ANW Obstacle Design Challenge and seven fan-submitted obstacles have been featured on the show.\u000aIn the national finals, a record 41 competitors successfully completed Stage 1, including Allyssa Beird, the second woman to complete Stage 1. On Stage 2, all athletes were eliminated except Joe Moravsky, Sean Bryan and Najee Richardson. During Stage 3, none of the three could complete the course. Richardson and Bryan fell on the Ultimate Cliffhanger, while Moravsky went the farthest, but failed Time Bomb. As in season 8, no competitor was able to complete Stage 3.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Season 10 (2018) ===\u000aSeason 10 of American Ninja Warrior is set to premiere in 2018. Cities announced are listed below.\u000a\u000a\u000a== ANW Specials ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== USA vs. the World / Japan ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== USA vs. Japan (Las Vegas, January 2014) ====\u000aDuring the season 5 finale of American Ninja Warrior, NBC announced that a special "USA vs. Japan" matchup would take place, the first-ever team competition in American Ninja Warrior's history. The two-hour special premiered on January 13, 2014, at 8 pm EST on NBC and matched five Japanese Sasuke All-Stars and New Stars - heroes of the original Ninja Warrior - against five American stars representing American Ninja Warrior at the American reconstruction of the Mount Midoriyama course in Las Vegas. At stake was the United States vs. Japan championship; also branded as the first world championship for Sasuke/American Ninja Warrior, and a trophy to match. The special featured American Ninja Warrior's regular broadcasting crew: analysts Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila along with sideline reporter Jenn Brown.\u000aThe teams faced off on each stage in turn, with each stage hosting its own round of five one-on-one matches and no competitor allowed to run the same stage twice. The first national team to win three matches out of five earned the point(s) for that stage. Stage One was worth one point, while Stage Two was worth two points and Stage Three was worth three. In the event of a 3-3 tie after the first three stages, the tiebreaker would be a one-off showdown where each country would pick one team member for a race to the top of the Final Stage.\u000aThe winners of the special were the Americans over Japan.\u000aFinal Score: Americans: 6, Japan: 0.\u000aRosters\u000a\u000a\u000a==== USA vs. the World (Las Vegas, September 2014) ====\u000aDuring the Season 6 finale, NBC announced that another special entitled "USA vs. the World" matchup would take place in Las Vegas under a new format. On September 15, Team USA competed against a returning Team Japan, and a new team, Team Europe. This was the "Second Annual International Competition" that pitted top competitors from the United States American Ninja Warrior, Japan Ninja Warrior (Sasuke), and also European All Stars. The three-hour special aired on September 15, 2014, on NBC with an encore airing September 16, 2014, on Esquire. The special once again was hosted by hosts Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila as well as sideline reporter Jenn Brown.\u000aThe winners of the special were the Europeans, winning over America and Japan.\u000aRosters\u000aTeam rosters were revealed late summer 2014.\u000aFinal Score: Europe: 10, USA: 9, Japan: 0\u000aHighlights\u000aJoe Moravsky beat Brent Steffenson's record (from ANW 4) for the fastest time in Stage 1, beating Steffenson's time of 1:14.53 with a time of 1:12.72. However, Tim Shieff beat Moravsky's time in a subsequent heat by finishing in 1:02.70 - the fastest time ever on Stage 1 in ANW history.\u000aTravis Rosen achieved the fastest time by an American on Stage 2 with 1:48.00, but Sean McColl finished with a time of 1:46.51, the fastest of the season. All three Americans (Travis Rosen, Elet Hall, and Brian Arnold) completed Stage 2, with Sean McColl also completing it for Team Europe.\u000aYusuke Morimoto made ANW history by becoming the first athlete to ever finish Stage 3 with a time of 5:38.91. Stefano Ghisolfi also completed Stage 3 in the same heat, beating Morimoto's time finishing in 4:46.89. Ryo Matachi followed by becoming the third athlete to complete Stage 3 with a time of 5:04.67. In the last run of Stage 3, Brian Arnold became the second American athlete to complete the stage (after Kane Kosugi did it in Sasuke 8) with a time of 4:39.90, the fastest time of the four finishers. Arnold's finish moved USA into a tie with Team Europe, forcing a deciding tie-break on Stage 4.\u000aFor the first time in ANW history, the athletes competed on Stage 4. Travis Rosen was selected as the first competitor on ANW to attempt the final stage and he made it all the way up Midoriyama's 90-foot tower with a 77-foot rope with a time of 0:35.77. However, Sean McColl beat Rosen's time by 3/10th of a second (0:00.31), winning the competition for Team Europe as they became the World Champions of ANW. Rosen missed on his first attempt at hitting the buzzer at the end of the rope climb.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== USA vs. the World II (Las Vegas, January 2016) ====\u000aNBC announced that another USA vs. the World matchup would again take place in Las Vegas.

aVThe Eritrean Democratic Working People's Party, more commonly referred to as the Labour Party, was a clandestine political party in Eritrea. The party existed between 1968 and 1982, constituting the core of the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF).\u000aThe party was founded by Marxists inside the ELF in November 1968. Amongst the founders were key ELF ideologues like Azein Yassin and Saleh Iyay. The goal of the party was the creation of an independent, socialist Eritrean state. It adhered to the Soviet-inspired 'Non-Capitalist Path of Development'. ELF leaders who were members of the party included Ahmed Nasser Mohammed, Abdellah Idris and Herui Tedla.\u000aThe party negotiated with the Eritrean People's Revolutionary Party about a merger of the ELF and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, but these talks resulted fruitless.\u000aThe party was dissolved in 1982. Several key personalities of the party joined either the ELF faction of Abdellah Idris, or the ELF-Revolutionary Council.  Another group, known as Sagem, joined the Eritrean People's Liberation Front in 1987 after the latter's second congress.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVA rootless cone, also formerly called a pseudocrater, is a volcanic landform which resembles a true volcanic crater, but differs in that it is not an actual vent from which lava has erupted. They are characterised by the absence of any magma conduit which connects below the surface of a planet.\u000aRootless cones are formed by steam explosions as flowing hot lava crosses over a wet surface, such as a swamp, a lake, or a pond. The explosive gases break through the lava surface in a manner similar to a phreatic eruption, and the tephra builds up crater-like forms which can appear very similar to real volcanic craters.\u000aWell known examples are found in Iceland like the craters in the lake Mývatn (Skútustaðagígar), the Rauðhólar in the region of the capital city Reykjavík or the Landbrotshólar in the southeast of Iceland near Kirkjubæjarklaustur. Rootless cones have also been discovered in the Athabasca Valles region of Mars, where lava flows superheated groundwater in the underlying rocks.\u000aVolcanologists witnessed the formation of a rootless cone for the first time in history during a steam explosion in connection with the first eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in March 2010.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Images ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aHornito\u000aList of rocks on Mars\u000aLittoral cone\u000aMaar\u000aVolcanism in Iceland\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aPseudocraters and Mars (PDF file)\u000aCones and Inflated Lava Flows on Mars\u000avideo and pictures of the formation of pseudocraters at Eyjafjallajökull 2010

aVGravesend  is an ancient town in northwest Kent, England, situated 21 miles (35 km) east-southeast of Charing Cross (central London) on the south bank of the Thames Estuary and opposite Tilbury in Essex. Located in the diocese of Rochester, it is the administrative centre of the Borough of Gravesham.\u000aIts geographical situation has given Gravesend strategic importance throughout the maritime and communications history of South East England. A Thames Gateway commuter town, it retains strong links with the River Thames, not least through the Port of London Authority Pilot Station and has witnessed rejuvenation since the advent of High Speed 1 rail services via Gravesend railway station.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Toponymy ==\u000aRecorded as Gravesham in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it belonged to Odo, Earl of Kent and Bishop of Bayeux, the half-brother of William the Conqueror, its name probably derives from graaf-ham: the home of the reeve or bailiff of the lord of the manor. Another theory suggests that the name Gravesham may be a corruption of the words grafs-ham \u2013 a place "at the end of the grove". Frank Carr asserts that the name derives from the Saxon Gerevesend, the end of the authority of the Portreeve (originally Portgereve, chief town administrator). In the Netherlands, a place called 's-Gravenzande is found with its name translating into "Sand (or sandy area) belonging to the Count". The 's is a contraction of the old Dutch genitive article des, and translates into plain English as of the. The neighbourhood of Gravesend, Brooklyn in the United States is said by some to have been named for 's-Gravenzande.\u000aThe Domesday spelling is its earliest known historical record; all other spellings \u2013 in the later (c. 1100) Domesday Monachorum and in Textus Roffensis the town is Gravesend and Gravesende, respectively. The variation Graveshend can be seen in a court record of 1422, where Edmund de Langeford was parson, and attributed to where the graves ended after the Black Death. The municipal title Gravesham was formally adopted in 1974 as the name for the new borough.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aStone Age implements have been found in the locality since the 1900s, as has evidence of an Iron Age settlement at nearby Springhead. Extensive Roman remains have been found at nearby Vagniacae; and Gravesend lies immediately to the north of the Roman road connecting London with the Kent coast \u2013 now called Watling Street. Domesday Book recorded mills, hythes, and fisheries here.\u000a\u000aMilton Chantry is Gravesend's oldest surviving building and dates from the early 14th century. It was refounded as a chapel in 1320/21 on the original site of a former leper hospital founded in 1189.\u000aGravesend has one of the oldest surviving markets in the country. Its earliest charter dates from 1268, with town status being granted to the two parishes of Gravesend and Milton by King Henry III in its Charter of Incorporation of that year. The first Mayor of Gravesend was elected in 1268, although the first Town Hall was not built until 1573, being replaced in 1764 with a new frontage added in 1836. Although it ceased to be a town hall in 1968 when the new Gravesend Civic Centre (Woodville Halls) was opened, it remains in use as Magistrates' Courts, and in 2004, following a full refurbishment funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and grants from Kent County Council and Gravesham Borough Council, the Old Town Hall now thrives as a venue for weddings and private functions as well as community and public events.\u000aIn 1380, during the Hundred Years' War, Gravesend suffered being sacked and burned by the Castilian fleet.\u000aIn 1401, a further Royal Charter was granted, allowing the men of the town to operate boats between London and the town; these became known as the "Long Ferry". It became the preferred form of passage, because of the perils of road travel (see below).\u000aOn Gravesend's river front are the remains of a Tudor fort built by command of King Henry VIII in 1543.\u000a\u000aOn 21 March 1617, John Rolfe and Rebecca (aka Princess Pocahontas) with their two-year-old son, Thomas, boarded a ship in London bound for the Commonwealth of Virginia; the ship had only sailed as far as Gravesend before Rebecca fell fatally ill, and she died when her body was taken ashore. It is not known what caused her death. Her funeral and interment took place on 21 March 1617 at the parish church of St George, Gravesend. The site of her grave was underneath the church's chancel, though since the previous church was destroyed by fire in 1727 her exact resting place is unknown. Thomas Rolfe survived, but was placed under the supervision of Sir Lewis Stukley at Plymouth, before being sent to his uncle, Henry Rolfe whilst John Rolfe and his late wife's assistant Tomocomo reached America under the captaincy of Sir Samuel Argall's ship.\u000a\u000aAt Fort Gardens is the New Tavern Fort, built during the 1780s and extensively rebuilt by Major-General Charles Gordon between 1865 and 1879: it is now Chantry Heritage Centre, partly open-air, under the care of Gravesend Local History Society.\u000aJourneys by road to Gravesend were historically quite hazardous, since the main London-Dover road crossed Blackheath, notorious for its highwaymen. Stagecoaches from London to Canterbury, Dover and Faversham used Gravesend as one of their "stages" as did those coming north from Tonbridge. In 1840 there were 17 coaches picking up and setting down passengers and changing horses each way per day. There were two coaching inns on what is now Old Road East: the Prince of Orange and the Lord Nelson. Post coaches had been plying the route for at least two centuries: Samuel Pepys records having stopped off at Gravesend in 1650 en route to the Royal Dockyards at Chatham.\u000aA permanent military presence was established in the town when Milton Barracks opened in 1862.\u000aAlthough a great deal of the town's economy continued to be connected with maritime trade, since the 19th century other major employers have been the cement and paper industries.\u000aFrom 1932 to 1956, an airport was located to the east of the town. It began as a civilian airfield, but during World War II it became a Royal Air Force fighter station, RAF Gravesend, and so Gravesend was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe. In 1956 the site was taken over by Gravesend Town Council; a large housing estate known as Riverview Park was built on its site. At 03:35 GMT on Sunday 5 February 1939, Alex Henshaw took off from Gravesend Airport at the start of his record-breaking flight to Cape Town and back. He completed the flight in 39 hours 36 minutes over the next four days; his record still stands.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Governance ==\u000aGravesend is part of and is the principal town of the Borough of Gravesham. The borough was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by the merger of the Municipal Borough of Gravesend and Northfleet Urban District along with several parishes from Strood Rural District. Gravesend was incorporated as a Municipal Borough in 1835 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 and Northfleet was constituted an Urban District in 1894 under the Local Government Act 1894: Gravesend absorbed Milton (1914), Denton, Chalk and part of Northfleet, including Claphall, Singlewell and King's Farm (1935).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geography ==\u000aThe location of Gravesend is at a point where the higher land \u2013 the lowest point of the dip slope of the North Downs \u2013 reaches the river bank. To the east are the low-lying Shorne Marshes; to the west, beyond Northfleet and the Swanscombe Marshes. The settlement thus established because it was a good landing place: it was also sheltered by the prominent height of what is now called Windmill Hill (see Landmarks below); although Windmill Hill still remains a dominant feature, Gravesend's highest point is actually further inland at Marling Cross, adjacent to the A2.\u000aFrom its origins as a landing place and shipping port, Gravesend gradually extended southwards and eastwards. Better-off people from London visited the town during the summer months; at first by boat, and then by railway. More extensive building began after World War I; this increased after World War II, when many of the housing estates in the locality were built.\u000aGravesend's built-up areas comprise Painters Ash, adjacent to the A2; King's Farm (most of King's Farm estate was built in the 1920s); and Christianfields. The latter housing estate has been completely rebuilt over a 6-year project from 2007 to 2013.\u000aPart of the southern built-up area of the town was originally two separate rural parishes: viz, Cobham and Northfleet.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Climate ==\u000aGravesend has an oceanic climate similar to much of southern England, being accorded Köppen Climate Classification-subtype of "Cfb" (Marine West Coast Climate).\u000aOn 10 August 2003, Gravesend recorded one of the highest temperatures since records began in the United Kingdom, with a reading of 38.1 °C (100.6 °F), only beaten by Brogdale, near Faversham, 26 miles (42 km) to the ESE. The Brogdale weather station, which is run by a volunteer, only reports its data once a month; Gravesend, which has a Met Office site, reports its data each hour.\u000aBeing inland and yet relatively close to continental Europe, Gravesend enjoys a somewhat more continental climate than the coastal areas of Kent, Essex and East Anglia and also compared to western parts of Britain. It is therefore less cloudy, drier, and less prone to Atlantic depressions with their associated wind and rain than western parts, as well as being hotter in summer and colder in winter.\u000aThus Gravesend continues to record higher temperatures in summer, sometimes being the hottest place in the country, e.g. on the warmest day of 2011, when temperatures reached 33.1 °C. Additionally, the town holds at least two records for the year 2010, of 30.9 °C and 31.7 °C. Another record was set during England's Indian summer of 2011 with 29.9 °C., the highest temperature ever recorded in the UK for October.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Demography ==\u000aSince 1990 the economy of Gravesham has changed from one based on heavy industry to being service-based. The borough's estimated population in 2012 was 101,700: a 6,000 increase in less than a decade. It has a high population density (almost 10 people per hectare) compared to nationally; it has a relatively young population (40% of the population are below 30); and 60% of the population are of working age.\u000aBased upon figures from the 2001 Census, the second largest religious group in the Borough are Sikh, who at that time made up 6.7% of the population. However, if the term belief is used, Christians are most numerous at more than 70%, non-religious and undeclared are second and third, with Sikhs as the fourth group.\u000aThe 2011 Census shows that, in the Medway area, Christians are now approximately 57% of the population, with the non-religious at 28%, whereas, in Gravesham, specifically, the population comprises 61% Christian, non-religious at 22% and Sikhs at 7.6%.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Economy ==\u000a\u000aGravesend today is a commercial and commuter town, providing a local shopping district: there are several of the multiple stores, and a good range of local shops. It has a market hall, open six days a week, and a recently established farmers' market. Crew for Thames tugboats live in town, with Gravesend watermen often hailing from a family tradition.\u000aThe Port of London Authority Control Centre (formerly known as "Thames Navigation Service") has its headquarters at Gravesend, providing maritime pilots with radar nowadays playing an important role in shipping navigation up the Thames.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Shopping ==\u000aGravesend hosts both major and independent retail stores and shops, including Bennett & Brown,  Munns, as well as Asda, Morrisons, Sainsburys and Tesco.\u000aIts geographical location in the Thames Gateway is a significant advantage: there are many commuters in its environs, with local enterprises employing as many people.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Landmarks ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Gravesend Town Pier ===\u000a\u000aGravesend has the world's oldest surviving cast iron pier, built in 1834. It is a unique structure having the first known iron cylinders used in its construction. The pier was completely refurbished in 2004 and now features a bar and restaurant; with public access to the pier head when the premises are open. A recent £2 million investment in a pontoon is now in place at the pier head onto the Thames, which provides for small and medium-sized craft to land at Gravesend. On 17 September 2012, the Gravesend - Tilbury Ferry, relocated to the Town Pier, from its previous terminal in nearby West Street.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Royal Terrace Pier ===\u000a\u000aBuilt in 1844 and originally named Terrace Pier, the prefix "Royal" was added in honour of Princess Alexandra of Denmark, who arrived at the Gravesend on her way to marry Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) in 1865. River pilots have been based at this pier since the late 19th century. Today, Royal Terrace Pier is in constant 24-hour use, keeping vigilant as part of the Port of London Authority main operations centre; thus, its public access is available only occasionally during the year.\u000aThis pier's initial construction was funded by the Gravesend Freehold Investment Company, at a cost of £9,000. It is 'T' shaped, with a pontoon at its pier head. Like the Town Pier, Royal Terrace Pier is also a Grade II listed structure.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Gravesend Clock Tower, Harmer Street ===\u000a\u000aSituated at the top of Harmer Street, its foundation stone was laid on 6 September 1887. The memorial stone records that the clock tower was erected by public subscription (£700 was raised toward its construction) and dedicated to Queen Victoria, to commemorate the 50th year of her reign. Built of Portland and Dumfries stone and backed by London stock brick, the design of the structure is based on the design of the Elizabeth Tower in the Palace of Westminster, which houses Big Ben. The centre of the clock itself is measured at 50 feet (15 m) above ground and the face measures 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m) in diameter.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Pocahontas Statue ===\u000aAn American sculptor, William Ordway Partridge, created a life-size statue of the 17th-century Native American princess Pocahontas, which was unveiled at Jamestown, Virginia in 1922. Queen Elizabeth II viewed this statue in 1957 and again on 4 May 2007, while visiting Jamestown on the 400th anniversary of foundation, it being the first successful English colonial settlement in America.\u000aOn 5 October 1958, an exact replica of the statue by Partridge was dedicated as a memorial to the 17th-century Native American princess at St George's Parish Church. The Governor of Virginia presented the statue as a gift to the British people in 1958, a gesture prompted by The Queen's visit to the USA in the previous year.\u000aIn 2017, US Ambassador Matthew Barzun visited the statue to mark the 400th anniversary of the death and burial of Pocahontas in Gravesend. The Ambassador, laid a floral tribute of 21 roses at the base of the statue, symbolising each year of Pocahontas' life. \u000a\u000a\u000a=== Windmill Hill ===\u000a\u000aWindmill Hill, named after its former windmills, offers extensive views across the Thames and was a popular spot for Victorian visitors to the town because of the camera obscura installed at the Old Mill and for its tea gardens and other amusements.\u000aThe hill was the site of a beacon in 1377, which was instituted by King Richard II, and still in use 200 years later at the time of the Spanish Armada, although the hill was then known as "Rouge Hill". A modern beacon was erected and lit in 1988, the 300th anniversary of the Armada.\u000aIt was during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I that the first windmill was placed at the highest point in Gravesend, 179 ft (55 m) overlooking the high-water mark of the river. One mill burnt down in 1763 but was replaced the following year and that too demolished in 1894. The last surviving windmill is reported as having been destroyed by fire during Mafeking Night celebrations in 1900.\u000aDuring World War I an Imperial German Navy airship passed over Windmill Hill, dropping bombs on it; today there are three markers indicating where these bombs struck.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Gravesend and the River Thames ==\u000a\u000aThe Thames has long been an important feature in Gravesend life and may well have been the deciding factor for the first settlement here. One of the town's first distinctions was in being given the sole right to transport passengers to and from London by water in the late 14th century. The "Tilt Boat" was a familiar sight on the Thames. The first steamboat plied its trade between Gravesend and London in the early 19th century, bringing with it a steadily increasing number of visitors to the Terrace Pier Gardens, Windmill Hill, Springhead Gardens and Rosherville Gardens. Gravesend soon became one of the first English resort towns and thrived from an early tourist trade.\u000aGravesend "watermen" were often in a family trade; and the town is the headquarters of the Port of London Authority Control Centre (formerly known as Thames Navigation Service), supplying both river and sea pilots. Today radar plays an important role in the navigation of shipping on the River Thames.\u000aA dinghy at an unmodernised Gravesend was the backdrop to the 1952 thriller The Long Memory starring Sir John Mills. In the film, Mills plays a character living in poverty on a derelict fishing boat stranded in the mud flats.\u000aGravesend also has one of England's oldest regattas retained from its strong maritime links with the Thames. Although the origins of the regatta are unknown it dates back at least to Tudor times. The races are traditionally competed by Gravesend Skiffs, 21-foot-long (6.4 m) oak-built clinker-built boats.\u000a\u000aThe Thames Navigation Service was first thought up between 1950 and 1952 by Cdr Peter de Neumann GM RN, when he was captain of HMRC Vigilant (HM Customs & Excise) based at Gravesend Reach. [It is possible that "Vigilant Way" in Gravesend is named for her.] This idea followed on from considering such incidents as the accidental ramming of HMS Truculent by the Divina in 1950, the collision with the Nore Forts by Baalbek, and the disastrous flooding of Canvey, Foulness and the East Coast in 1953. In these and other situations, rescue and intelligence gathering were severely hampered by a lack of centralised command and control, and lack of detailed "picture". De Neumann resigned his command after returning Vigilant from the Spithead Review and joined the PLA, immediately suggesting in a report to them, submitted in 1953, that a feasibility study of such a system be commenced. He then oversaw its development and ultimate installation at Gravesend.\u000aUntil the building of Tilbury Docks on the opposite side of the river, between 1882 and 1886, Gravesend was the Thames' first port of entry. Thousands of emigrants, as well as large numbers of troops, embarked from here. Tilbury Docks have expanded considerably since with the closure of all the London Docks. The entrance to the Docks is somewhat awkward, situated as it is on the sharp bend of the river, and often need tugboat assistance, as do the larger ships moored at Tilbury landing stages. There have been many tug companies based at Gravesend: among them the Sun Company, the Alexandra Towing Company and, today, the Smith Howard Towing Company. East Indiamen traditionally stopped here at a point known as Long Reach to lighten their loads before sailing up the Thames to moorings at Blackwall.\u000aFor some years after war steamer excursions were run on the MV Royal Daffodil down the Thames from Gravesend to France, but they ceased in 1966. Cruises are now operated by the Lower Thames and Medway Passenger Boat Company up the river to Greenwich. The cross-river passenger ferry to Tilbury provides a long-established route to and from Essex. Before the Dartford Crossing came into being there was a vehicle ferry at Gravesend too.\u000aThere is a RNLI lifeboat station based at Royal Terrace Pier which has become one of the busiest in the country.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Thames and Medway Canal ===\u000a\u000aThe Thames and Medway Canal was opened for barge traffic in 1824. It ran from Gravesend on the Thames to Frindsbury near Strood on the Medway. Although seven miles long it had only two locks, each 94 ft by 22 ft in size, one at each end. Its most notable feature was the tunnel near Strood which was 3,946 yds long, the second longest canal tunnel ever built in the UK. The great cost of the tunnel meant that the canal was not a commercial success.\u000aAfter only 20 years most of the canal was closed and the canal's tunnel was converted to railway use. Initially canal and railway shared the tunnel, with the single track built on timber supports, but by 1847 canal use was abandoned and a double track laid. Today Gravesend Canal Basin is used for the mooring of pleasure craft. Gravesend Sailing Club which was founded so that working men could participate in the sport while still having to earn a living is based here. The lock has been dredged and restoration and strengthening works have been carried out to the basin walls as part of regeneration of the area.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Transport ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Roads ===\u000aThe main roads through the town are the west-east A226 road from Dartford and beyond to Rochester; and the A227 road to Tonbridge. The A2 road passes two miles (3 km) south of Gravesend town centre; a mile stretch of it was rerouted in the early 2000s to take the traffic away from the south end of the town.\u000aIn March 2006 the first of the area\u2019s new Fastrack bus services, which use a combination of ordinary roads and dedicated 'bus tracks', opened. The service links to Ebbsfleet International railway station, Greenhithe, Bluewater Shopping Centre and Dartford.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Rail ===\u000a\u000aGravesend railway station lies on the North Kent Line, and was opened in 1849. The Gravesend West Line, terminating by the river and for some time operating as a continental ferry connection, closed in 1968.\u000aGravesend is the primary north Kent interchange for high speed and metro rail services. In December 2009, the full high-speed timetable between London and Kent came into force and passenger usage from Gravesend has exceeded expectations. High-speed services from London St Pancras International and Stratford International, are offered via Gravesend to the Medway towns, Sittingbourne, Faversham, Margate, Broadstairs and Ramsgate. Some of these services continue to Ashford International via Sandwich and Dover Priory. There are also metro services to London Charing Cross, London Waterloo East and London Bridge via Sidcup, via Woolwich Arsenal and Lewisham and Bexleyheath, and to Gillingham.\u000aUnusually Gravesend features a Platform 0, one of the few in the country, it is used for terminating services from Cannon Street or Charing Cross via Sidcup\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Buses ===\u000aGravesend is served by several Arriva Kent Thameside bus services connecting the town with other areas in Kent including Dartford, Bluewater and Sevenoaks and to the Medway Towns.\u000aGravesend is also served by Fastrack bus services connecting the town with Bluewater, Darent Valley Hospital and Dartford.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ferry ===\u000a\u000aPassenger ferry services to Tilbury, Essex, operate daily (except Sundays), from Gravesend Town Pier.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Footpaths ===\u000aThe Saxon Shore Way, a long distance footpath, starts at Gravesend and traces the coast as in Roman times as far as Hastings, East Sussex; 163 miles (262 km) in total. The Wealdway also starts at the Town Pier, and continues almost due south over the Weald to Eastbourne in East Sussex where it links with South Downs Way, a distance of 80 miles (128 km).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Religious buildings ==\u000aThe town's principal Anglican place of worship is the Church of St George, Gravesend. This Georgian building is a tourist attraction because of its association with Princess Pocahontas, as well as being the parish church. Gravesend has three other Church of England parishes and Roman Catholic, Methodist, United Reformed and Baptist churches as well as other smaller chapels.\u000aGravesend has a significant Sikh population. Its first gurdwara was founded in 1956 by Bhat Sikh Santokh Singh Takk (off Pelham Road South) in Edwin Street with a second one opening, ten years later, in a former Congregationalist church, but this gurdwara closed in 2010. The same year, one of the United Kingdom's largest and most impressive Sikh temples was opened at a cost of £12 million.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Education ==\u000aIn secondary education, Gravesend has the following schools: Gravesend Grammar School; Northfleet School for Girls; Northfleet Technology College (Northfleet School for Boys, on the former sites of Northfleet Secondary School for Boys and Gravesend Technical High School for Boys); Mayfield Grammar School (formerly Gravesend Grammar School for Girls); St John's Catholic Comprehensive School; Thamesview School and St George's Church of England School. There are also primary age schools such as Whitehill Primary School, special schools and several independent schools.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Health ==\u000aGravesend Hospital was opened in 1854, following the donation of a site by the 6th Earl of Darnley in 1853; it had its origin on 2 December 1850, as a dispensary on the Milton Road "to assist the really destitute poor of Gravesend and Milton and vicinities ... unable to pay for medical aid". By 1893, 4,699 such people had benefited by its presence. In 2004 the original building, and parts of the newer buildings were demolished to make way for a new community hospital. Gravesend Community Hospital provides a Minor Injury Unit, Dental services, Speech and Language therapy and Physiotherapy. It also has a Stroke Ward and offers inpatient care. The outpatient department provides care for much of the local area and is separate from those offered at Darent Valley Hospital. In addition, Gravesend emergency doctors out of hours service as well as podiatry are offered.\u000aIn the town centre is a large medical clinic at Swan Yard, next to the Market car park, and several other doctors' surgeries are located in the area.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sport ==\u000aThe Stonebridge Road football ground at neighbouring Northfleet is home to Ebbsfleet United F.C., which changed its name from Gravesend and Northfleet F.C. in June 2007. Ebbsfleet currently plays in the Conference South, and the club won the FA Trophy in May 2008. An agreement was reached for the MyFootballClub online community to purchase a 75% stake in the club in November 2007, and its takeover was completed early in 2008.\u000aGravesend Cricket Club is based at the Bat and Ball Ground on Wrotham Road, where cricket has been played since its foundation at the behest of the 6th Earl of Darnley (grandfather of the celebrated England cricketer, The Hon. Ivo Bligh, later 8th Earl of Darnley) in the mid 19th century.\u000aGravesend also has two rugby teams, Gravesend RFC and Old Gravesendians, both situated next to each other opposite the Gravesend Grammar School. Established in the 1870s, Gravesend RFC have been the towns senior club since league rugby was established in the 1980s. In the 2009/10 season Gravesend RFC secured a league and cup double by winning the London 1 South title in emphatic style and the Kent Cup for just the second time. The 2010/11 season saw the club make their debut in National League 3 London & SE finishing a respectable 6th. This is the highest level attained, in their 130-year history, and only four leagues below The Aviva Premiership.They were also successful in retaining the Kent Cup, beating Tonbridge Juddians in a close fought final. Unfortunately, in the 2012/13 season, Gravesend were relegated from the National Leagues, but completed yet another league and cup double in 2013/14 beating Blackheath in the county final and promotion back to National League 3. The team also saw players in the victorious Kent team who won the County Plate at Twickenham.\u000aOld Gravesendians was traditionally the Old Boys Club for former Gravesend GS pupils. Old G's have had some of their best success in recent seasons reaching six Kent Plate Finals (winning two of these) and achieving promotion to London League rugby in 2009. Unfortunately this proved a step too far with relegation in 2009/10. Old G's put out three sides with the first team playing in Kent 1.\u000aThe multi-sport facility at Gravesend Rugby Club, includes cricket, bowls, tennis, hockey, pigeon fanciers, table tennis, Wheelchair Rugby League, Wheelchair Rugby 7's and pétanque. The latter facilities with seventeen international size pistes are some of the best in the south of England, and can with a width reduction to 3 metres accommodate 48 teams.\u000aRowing races have been held on the River Thames at Gravesend since at least 1698, with the first organised Regatta recorded in 1715. The first Borough Regatta began in 1882, setting the pattern for an annual event on the Thames that is carried on to this day. The River Thames in Gravesend is home to Gravesend Rowing Club, the oldest sports club in the town, the Regatta Committee's skiff rowers, and Gravesend Sailing Club.\u000aTo the south of Gravesend on the ancient site of Watling Street on 43ha of land adjacent to the A2, Cyclopark, a venue for cycling events and other activities has been developed. The site which features mountain bike trails, a road circuit, a BMX racetrack and family cycling paths was formally opened in early 2012.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Culture ==\u000aThe Gravesend Historical Society meets regularly and produces a biannual magazine on its activities.\u000aCharles Dickens lived at Gad's Hill Place, 2 miles (3.2 km) east of Gravesend and specifically mentions the town and its environs in at least three of his novels. In David Copperfield Mr. Peggotty, Ham and the Micawbers say their goodbyes and sail away from Gravesend to begin a new life in Australia. In Great Expectations, Pip, with accomplices, rows Magwitch from London downriver in expectation of waylaying a regular steamer (whilst under way in the Lower Hope, off Gravesend) bound for Hamburg. (Gravesend also appears in The Pickwick Papers).\u000aGravesend is briefly mentioned in the 1818 novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley during Victor's travels through the United Kingdom with Clerval; ultimately culminating in Victor's residence in the Orkney Islands.\u000aAlso in the 1902 novel Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad the narrator has dark aired Gravesend as the perspective from which we continue our gaze of a sky that is mournfully gloomy over London. Waiting for the tide near the shores of Gravesend is the setting from which shipmate Marlow tells his tale.\u000aThe The War Game was a 1965 television drama-documentary film depicting a nuclear war. Written, directed, and produced by Peter Watkins for the BBC's The Wednesday Play anthology series, it caused dismay within the BBC and in government, and was withdrawn before the provisional screening date of Thursday 7 October 1965.[1] The corporation said that "the effect of the film has been judged by the BBC to be too horrifying for the medium of broadcasting. It will, however, be shown to invited audiences..."[2]\u000aDespite this decision, it was publicly screened and shown abroad, winning the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1966.\u000aThe film was eventually broadcast on 31 July 1985 on the BBC, during the week before the fortieth anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing, the day before a repeat screening of Threads.[4]\u000aThe film was shot in the Kent towns of Tonbridge, Gravesend, Chatham and Dover. The cast was almost entirely made up of non-actors, casting having taken place via a series of public meetings several months earlier. Much of the filming of the post-strike devastation was shot at the Grand Shaft Barracks, Dover. The narration was provided by Peter Graham with Michael Aspel reading the quotations from source material.\u000aThe 1952 film "The Long Memory" starring John Mills was filmed in and around Gravesend. It features many squalid streets running down towards the river that even then were being progressively cleared for redevelopment. It is also possible to hear in the background steam engines working out of the Gravesend West Line West Street terminus. Except for the skeletal remains of the pier all evidence of this station has now disappeared.\u000aGravesend is mentioned in Ridley Scott's 2010 film Robin Hood. Robin (played by Russell Crowe) and his companions intend to return to England from France by boat to Gravesend, after they flee the army of King Richard I, at whose death in battle they were present as archers.\u000aGravesend is also briefly mentioned in John Irving's novel A Prayer for Owen Meany, noting that the fictitious town of Gravesend, New Hampshire, is named after the original Gravesend in Kent.\u000aIn the 1978 version of John Buchan's The 39 Steps the German agents plan to blow up Big Ben, triggering the start of World War I, and escape on a ship called Ariadne which is anchored off Gravesend.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notable people ==\u000a\u000aPocahontas (1595\u20131617), the daughter of a Native American chieftain, was to become the first such American to visit England. After marrying an English colonist in America, John Rolfe, she later sailed with him to London, with their two-year-old son, Thomas, where she was received at Court being feted as a celebrity in London. On their return voyage, seven months later, she was taken ill and died ashore in Gravesend at age 21. She was then buried under the chancel of St George's parish church.\u000aCharles Dickens is associated with Gravesend and villages around the borough. Although he died over 100 years ago, many of the links between him and Gravesham are still in evidence \u2013 Gravesend he visited, at Chalk he spent his honeymoon, at Higham he lived and died, and at Cobham he found inspiration for The Pickwick Papers.\u000aGravesend is associated with Major-General Charles Gordon (1833\u20131885), who lived in the town during the construction of the Thames forts. For six years he devoted himself to the welfare of the town's "poor boys", establishing a Sunday School and providing food and clothes for them from his Army wages. As commanding officer of the Royal Engineers from 1865 to 1871, he was in charge of the forts guarding the Thames downstream from Gravesend, New Tavern Fort in the town, Shornemead Fort on the Thames's south bank, and Coalhouse Fort on the north in Essex. His links with Gravesend are commemorated locally on the embankment at the Riverside Leisure Area, which is known as the Gordon Promenade, and at Khartoum Place that lies just to the south. General Gordon's tomb lies in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral.\u000aThe composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844\u20131908) was an officer in the Russian Navy and was posted to Gravesend in 1862, where he wrote part of his first symphony, said to be the first such style of composition attempted by a Russian composer.\u000aSir Edwin Arnold (1832\u20131904), English poet and journalist whose most prominent work as a poet was The Light of Asia (1879).\u000aGemma Arterton (born 1986), actress, was born at Northfleet and attended Gravesend Grammar School for Girls.\u000aHarry Reid (actor) (born 1992), actor whose most prominent work as an actor is currently in EastEnders as Ben Mitchell, was born in and lives in Gravesend.

aVSigma Kappa (\u03a3\u039a) is a sorority founded in 1874 at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. Sigma Kappa was founded by five women: Mary Caffrey Low Carver, Elizabeth Gorham Hoag, Ida Mabel Fuller Pierce, Frances Elliott Mann Hall and Louise Helen Coburn. Since its founding in 1874, the sorority has initiated more than 165,000 members worldwide and has more than 120 collegiate chapters in 36 states and over 120 alumnae chapters in 40 states.\u000aThe sorority's official philanthropies are gerontology (with a focus on Alzheimer's disease research), Inherit the Earth, and the Maine Sea Coast Mission. In 2015, Sigma Kappa alumna, Donna King, Epsilon Rho, was installed as the 2015-2017 Chairman of the National Panhellenic Conference.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aColby College in Waterville, Maine, was the first college in New England to admit women on an equal basis with men; in 1871, Mary Caffrey Low Carver became the first female student at Colby. For two years, she was the only woman at the school. But in 1873, four more young women from Maine, Elizabeth Gorham Hoag, Ida Mabel Fuller Pierce, Frances Elliott Mann Hall and Louise Helen Coburn were admitted to Colby. Being the only women in the college, the five of them found themselves together frequently. In 1873-74, the five young women decided to form a literary and social society. They were instructed by the college administration that they would need to present a constitution and bylaws with a petition requesting permission to form Sigma Kappa Sorority. They began work during that year and on November 9, 1874, the five received a letter from the faculty approving their petition. They sought for and received permission to form a sorority with the intent for the organization to become national.\u000aSince that time, Sigma Kappa annually celebrates November 9 as its Founders' Day.\u000aMary Caffrey Low was the first woman to appear on the rolls of Sigma Kappa and the first to preside over an initiation. The first Sigma Kappa emblem was designed by Elizabeth Gorham Hoag, who died shortly thereafter of tuberculosis. A large portion of the initiation ceremony was written by Louise Helen Coburn. Much of the original initiation music was written by Hoag's cousin, Emily Peace Meader, who was inducted shortly before Hoag's death in 1875. Frances Mann Hall was the first Sigma Kappa to get married, to a fellow Colby student.\u000aIn the first constitution, chapter membership was limited to 25. The original group was known as Alpha chapter and as the sorority grew, Beta chapter and Gamma chapter were also established at Colby College. Early records indicate that the groups met together; but in 1893, the Sigma Kappa members decided that intramural expansion was not desirable. They voted to fill Alpha chapter to the limit of 25 and to initiate no more into Beta and Gamma chapters. Eventually, the second and third chapters would vanish from Colby campus. Finally, Sigma Kappas realized if the organization was going to continue to grow, it had to expand beyond the walls of Colby College.\u000aThe Delta Chapter of Boston University is now the oldest existing chapter. The Eta Chapter of Illinois Wesleyan University is the longest continuously running chapter. In 1984, Colby College banned fraternities and sororities, ensuring that Sigma Kappa's Alpha, Beta, and Gamma chapters will probably never be resurrected.\u000aIn 2005, the Sigma Kappa Mu Chapter House obtained City of Seattle Landmark status, becoming the only sorority or fraternity in Seattle to achieve Historic Landmark status both at the City of Seattle and on the National Historic Register.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Jewelry ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Membership badge ===\u000aThe current membership badge is a one-inch jeweled triangle with Greek letters \u03a3 and \u039a. The triangle badge was chosen in 1894. Jeweled badges were approved at the 1915 convention when the pearl was adopted as the national jewel. Unjeweled badges have a scroll edge. Badges are either made of silver, white gold or yellow gold.\u000aThe new members pin is only worn during the new member period. It is a serpent in the form of the Greek "\u03a3" (Sigma) intertwined on a Greek "\u039a" (Kappa). This design was adopted as the new member pin in 1920.\u000aThere are also alumni pins, 25-year pins, and 50-year pins, and the "Pearl Court Pin" which is given to recipients of the Ernestine Duncan Collins Pearl Court Award, which is a national award given by the organization.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Symbols ==\u000aIn June 1892, the violet was adopted as the official flower. In 2008, the official flower became the Wild Purple Violet to distinguish it from other varieties of violets.\u000aSigma Kappa's colors are lavender and maroon. The pearl is the official jewel of Sigma Kappa. The dove was accepted as an official symbol of Sigma Kappa at the 1984 convention and the heart was adopted at the 1988 convention.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Crest ===\u000aThe Sigma Kappa coat-of-arms includes the symbols of the sorority - the dove, the violet, the Greek letters, and maroon and lavender. Adopted in 1911, the coat-of-arms consists of a maroon shield with a diagonal bar of gold, bearing five lavender stars; the lower portion a coiled serpent. Above is a wreath of alternate maroon and gold, surmounted by a dove in silver, with outspread wings, all beneath an arch of gold rays. Below is a scroll of silver, bearing in black the open motto and the date 1874. The significance of the coat-of-arms is revealed only during the ceremony of Initiation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Philanthropies ==\u000aSigma Kappa is associated with the Sigma Kappa Foundation, which was established in 1962, and incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in 1989.Since 1918, Sigma Kappa has worked with the Maine Sea Coast Mission to aid communities and ecologies of coastal Maine. Since 1954, the organization has also supported Alzheimer's Disease research and other issues related to gerontology. In 1945 gerontology was adopted as another main philanthropy of Sigma Kappa. Members help elderly people in their communities. The Organization's "Inherit the Earth" program involves working to protect the environment through a variety of different projects.\u000aThe Walk to End Alzheimer's and Ultra Violet are the two biggest philanthropy events that every Sigma Kappa chapter takes part in. Every year each sorority for the Walk to End Alz, makes a team and raises money weeks prior to the walk. Then after this done the sororities participate on the day of the walk and the money goes directly to the Alzheimer's Association. The Sigma Kappa Foundation has had a long-term partnership with the Alzheimer's Association. According to sigmakappa.org, "In 2015, Sigma Kappa raised over $700,000 across the country and became a 2016 Platinum National Walk Team. The Ultra Violet is another one of Sigma Kappa's philanthropy events. A lot of chapters have Galas, raffles, auctions and much more and make them customizable for their chapter to give back to it's foundation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Values ==\u000aSigma Kappa is known for its four core values that are all bound by a promise. The four values are friendship, loyalty, service and personal growth. There values are all what binds Sigma Kappa together. The value friendship is important not only to your sisters but to the alumna and by having self respect for not only themselves but one another. The value loyalty is a bound with the promise that each sister will remain loyal and will live out the values in her every day life. Personal growth is bound by the promise that each women will be the best they can be intellectually, spiritually and socially. Lastly, service is important that each sister spends time helping not only those in the community but every one around them and will take the time to offer new ideas for the common good. \u000a\u000a\u000a== Notable Sigma Kappas ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Chapters ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aSigma Delta, former chapter at Dartmouth College.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aSigma Kappa Sorority website\u000aAlzheimer's Association\u000aMaine Sea Coast Mission\u000aGuide to Sigma kappa Records at the University of Denver Retrieved 2014-09-26.\u000aLouisvillle Sigma Kappa

aVThe gens Herminia was an ancient patrician house at Rome. Members of the gens appear during the first war between the Roman Republic and the Etruscans, circa 508 BC, and from then to 448 BC. Two members of the family held the consulship, Titus Herminius Aquilinus in 506 BC, and Lars Herminius Aquilinus in 448.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Origin ==\u000aThe Roman antiquaries regarded the Herminii as an Etruscan family. Silius Italicus mentions an Etruscan fisherman by this name. The Herminii are one of the only Roman families known to have used distinctly Etruscan praenomina. However, in the traditions relating to the stand of Horatius and his companions at the Sublician Bridge, Titus Herminius appears to represent the ancient tribe of the Titienses, the Sabine element of the Roman populus. A number of Sabine and Oscan names begin with the syllable, Her-.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Praenomina ==\u000aThe praenomina associated with the Herminii are Titus and Lars, although in place of Lars, some sources give Spurius or Lucius.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Branches and cognomina ==\u000aThe only Heminii appearing in the consular fasti bore the cognomen Aquilinus, apparently derived from aquila, an eagle.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Members ==\u000aThis list includes abbreviated praenomina.

aVThe Nokia 6303 classic is a mobile telephone handset produced by Nokia in Hungary. The Nokia 6303 classic has been in production since the second quarter of 2009. It is the successor to the Nokia 6300 (even though PhoneArena confirmed the Nokia 6700 classic was the successor [1]).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Features ==\u000aThe phone supports MicroSD cards up to 32 GB, meaning that the phone can be used practically as an MP3 player. Using the supplied and freely available Nokia PC Suite, one has the option of converting MP3s to e-AAC for more compression. The 3.5 mm headphone jack means that many standard commercial headsets will fit the phone. Like most other recent Nokia phones, the 6303 classic replaced their old Pop-Port connector for a standard micro-USB connector.\u000aThe phone allows the user to view the video clips in full-screen landscape mode and set the fast-forward/rewind interval from a few seconds to minutes. Improved audio quality for music playback was also noted for this firmware version, thus making the Nokia 6303 classic a music phone similar to its counterparts, the Nokia XpressMusic. In addition, video clips can replace ringtones so that an actual motion picture is shown while there is an incoming call.\u000aNokia announced the "i" version of the 6303 classic phone in February 2010 which was released in March that year. The 3.2-megapixel camera lacked autofocus and video recording was now done at 240×320 at 8 frames per second. It has been refreshed with a new UI and new graphics. The 6303i classic supports up to 8 GB (16 GB according to some sources) MicroSD cards, supplied with 2 GB instead of 1 GB. The internal memory has also been raised to 55 MB. The battery life has been enhanced to 515 hours of standby and 8 hours talk time. It now comes with 7 inbuilt games instead of four (the 6303 had Bounce Tales, Brain Champ, City Bloxx and Sudoku where the 6303i has those 4 games, plus the additional games which are Block'd, High Roller casino and Rally Stars). The 6303i classic has faced negative reviews due to the camera downgrade. Both models are available in the market.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reception ==\u000aAlthough the 6303 classic has smartphone features, it is more user-friendly and straightforward. It is aimed for users who want a reliable and stylish phone, used mostly for calling and texting.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Specification sheet ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVChangi General Hospital (Abbreviation: CGH) is a 1000-bed hospital located in Simei, eastern Singapore. It is Singapore's first purpose-built general hospital to serve communities in the east and north-east regions.\u000aThe hospital has a comprehensive range of more than 23 medical services, from general surgery, internal medicine, cardiology, ENT to orthopaedic surgery and sports medicine. It houses six specialist centres \u2013 Breast Centre, Changi Sports Medicine Centre, Diabetes Centre, Geriatric Centre, Integrated Sleep Service and Medical Centre for International Travellers.\u000aThe hospital is JCI (Joint Commission International) accredited.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aOn 15 February 1997, the Old Changi Hospital merged with Toa Payoh Hospital to form New Changi Hospital and began to move into the present premises.

aVThe Kanawha Madonna is a wood carving of a person holding a four-legged animal. The carving is part of the collection of the West Virginia State Museum and displayed in the Cultural Center as an example of prehistoric Native American wood carving. The statue is nearly 4 feet (1.2 m) tall with a 8 inches (20 cm) in height by 13 inches (33 cm) in width base. It was carved from the trunk of a honey locust tree. The base has a hole in the bottom, possibly for mounting on a pole.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discovery ==\u000aIn 1897, four teenaged boys found the statue while exploring a cave set in a cliff above the lower New River, in Kanawha County, West Virginia. They found the statue under a large flat stone. A member of the West Virginia Historical and Antiquarian Society, Dr. John P. Hale acquired the statue. Hale visited the cave and presented a paper about the statue.\u000aIn 1964 a radiocarbon date put the statue's age at 350 years. A more recent radiocarbon dating estimates the wood to date from between 1440 to 1600 CE, although this does not mean it was carved at this time.

aVBrad Miller (born 6 July 1983) is a former Australian rules football player who last played for the Richmond Football Club. He previously played with the Melbourne Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL) until he was delisted at the end of the 2010 season.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aBrad is the son of Neville Miller, who played 28 games with the South Melbourne Football Club. Having spent his early childhood in Sandy Bay, Tasmania, Miller moved to Brisbane in Queensland with his family at an early age, where he played rugby league from age 13. On his father's advice, he later tried Australian rules football, ending up at the Mount Gravatt Football Club, where he was scouted by AFL club the Melbourne Demons.\u000a\u000a\u000a== AFL career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Melbourne ===\u000a\u000aPicked at number 55 in the 2001 AFL Draft, Miller carried a reputation and promise of becoming a key position centre half forward in the mould of Wayne Carey or Jonathan Brown. However he spent much of his early career in defence and did not kick a goal until his 17th game.\u000aAt the Demons, Miller struggled early to reach his potential at centre half forward, showing promise with 2 goal hauls and taking strong marks, but poor decision making and kicking skills often resulted in turnovers. In some games but with a reputation for disgressions that ended with tribunal appearances and suspensions. A maximum kicking distance of just under 50 metres made Miller an unlikely option for centre half forward.\u000aAt times, he was used by coach Neale Daniher in defence, and held down big key opposition forwards like Barry Hall, but was ultimately a second choice in defence behind Nathan Carroll and Ben Holland.\u000aIn a game against Richmond in round 17 of 2004, he kicked a rare bag of four goals. He had previously never kicked more than a goal a game.\u000aA slump in form in 2006, saw him play most of the season for the Sandringham Zebras, including an appearance in their premiership side.\u000aWhile he was still fairly early in his career, the media began speculating that he might be traded to the Brisbane Lions for Jason Akermanis so that Miller could return to his home of Queensland.\u000aWhen he did return to the senior Demons lineup just before the finals, he was involved in a collision that led to Geelong player Tom Lonergan losing one of his kidneys.\u000aMiller played a best on ground performance in the Demons losing finals game against the Fremantle Dockers in Perth in an impressive performance. Many believe that this saved him from being traded in the pre-season draft.\u000aMiller played what was possibly his best game at the club in Round 7 of the 2008 Season against Fremantle at the MCG.\u000aAfter the retirement of David Neitz and Achilles tendon injury to Russell Robertson, coach Dean Bailey tried a number of options at full forward in a forward line which struggled to kick goals before eventually entrusting the role to Miller. Miller had an immediate impact with bags of 3 goals against Richmond, the Western Bulldogs and North Melbourne. He had also shown an impressive increase in goalkicking accuracy.\u000aHe came of age when he kicked the winning goal in a career high four goal haul against the Brisbane Lions in round 14.\u000aMiller finished the year with 26 goals. The fact that this was the highest total by a Melbourne player in 2008 highlighted their forward line struggles.\u000aIn 2010, Miller lined up for the round 1 clash versus Hawthorn but was subsequently dropped the next week following the teams poor performance, he would not return to the seniors until round 9 against Port Adelaide at TIO stadium in Darwin. Miller kicked five goals, helping the team win a thrilling match by one point in high humidity conditions. Miller struggled to remain in the senior team and was eventually dropped back to the VFL where he played out the rest of the season.\u000aIn Round 15 in a VFL match against Gold Coast Suns, Miller sparked the side with six goals in the third quarter. He finished with 10.4 for the afternoon and his team, Casey, won the match by four points.\u000aOn 23 August 2010, Brad Miller, alongside teammate Daniel Bell, were delisted by the Melbourne Football Club. However, Miller was the highest polling Melbourne player in the Casey Scorpions Best and Fairest and several clubs, including the new Gold Coast Football Club and the Richmond Football Club both expressed interest in recruiting him.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Richmond ===\u000aRichmond picked up Brad Miller with pick 28 in the Rookie Draft on 7 December 2010.\u000aOn August 16, 2012, Miller, along with Tigers teammate Kelvin Moore, announced his retirement, effective immediately, due to a calf injury. He left Richmond, having played 157 AFL games (133 with Melbourne, 24 with Richmond) and having booted 120 goals. (89 with Melbourne, 31 with Richmond).\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aBrad Miller's profile on the official website of the Melbourne Football Club\u000aBrad Miller's statistics from AFL Tables\u000aDemon Wiki profile

aV"Lil Star" is the second international single from Kelis' fourth studio album, Kelis Was Here (2006). Released outside US (where "Blindfold Me" served as the second single), the single features Cee-Lo, who is known for being a half of the duo Gnarls Barkley. Following the moderate success of "Bossy", the single has proven to be a return to form for Kelis; it debuted at number eight in Ireland and was also a huge hit in the United Kingdom reaching number three on the UK Singles Chart. The track was hailed by many music fans and critics as Kelis' "comeback" single, despite the fact "Bossy" was written specifically for Kelis' return to music.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Song information ==\u000aAs for the song, the soulful and pensive "Lil Star" features Kelis singing about the time when she has self-doubt, giving fans a look at her vulnerable side. "I can't be confident and bold and obnoxious all the time", Kelis says. "What kind of person would I be? I'm a human being and I have other sides, too. I'm not always secure and I'm not always confident. I have moments where I get self-conscious."\u000aThe song was tentatively set to be released on January 8, 2007, but to allow time for promotion the release date was pushed back to February 19. However, on January 8, the song was added to the C List of BBC Radio 1 Playlist, and has since been promoted to their A List, guaranteeing at least 20 plays a week.\u000aThe video for "Lil Star" was filmed by Marc Klasfeld, and has been on rotation since January 13, 2007 when it was added to British urban music channel MTV Base's videos roster.\u000a"Lil Star" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 37 on January 28, 2007. The following week, high download sales enabled an 18-position jump to number 19. On February 12, 2007 "Lil Star" moved into the UK top 15 at the number-13 position. During its fourth week in the top 40, the song es slid down two placto number 15. However, on February 26, 2007, in the fifth week on the UK chart it moved from number 15 to the top three. "Lil Star" landed at number three on the UK Singles Chart in the week of its physical release.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Chart performance ==\u000a"Lil Star" made its debut on the UK Singles Chart at number eighty-four on January 21, 2007 based on downloads alone five weeks before its release and climbed the charts rapidly to number thirty-seven within a matter of weeks due to strong download sales. Several weeks later it managed to make its initial peak at number thirteen based on downloads sales. After is official release it peaked at number three, becoming the first single from Kelis Was Here to reach the top three in the UK, and became Kelis' highest-charting single since 2004's "Millionaire". "Lil Star" also entered several other UK charts including the UK R&B Singles Chart where it peaked at number one, the UK Airplay Chart where it peaked at number three, the UK Official Download Chart where it reached number nine, and the UK iTunes Top 100 countdown where it peaked at number eleven. To date, "Lil Star" remains one of Kelis' best-selling singles in the UK where it sold over 118,000 copies. "Lil Star" also peaked at number eight in Ireland, her highest-peaking single since "Milkshake" back in 2003. "Lil Star" found similar success in Eastern Europe; it peaked at number four in Slovenia, number seven in Hungary, and number eighteen in Slovakia. Although "Lil Star" performed well in European countries such as the UK and Ireland, it became a commercial failure in Germany, peaking at number ninety-nine, Kelis' lowest-charting single there to date. "Lil Star" was to be released in Australia as the second single from Kelis Was Here, with its video having been aired on music programs around Australia, but for unknown reasons it did not happen and instead "I Don't Think So" was released.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Music video ==\u000aThe video for "Lil Star" was filmed in Los Angeles in December 2006 and directed by Marc Klasfeld, who had previously worked with Kelis on "Bossy" and "Blindfold Me" earlier in 2006.

aVMeramec State Park is a state-owned, public recreation area located near Sullivan, Missouri, about 60 miles from St. Louis, along the Meramec River. The park has diverse ecosystems such as hardwood forests and glades. There are over 40 caves located throughout the park, the geology of which is a mixture of limestone and dolomite. The most famous is Fisher Cave, located near the campgrounds. The park borders the Meramec Conservation Area.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe park was acquired by the state in 1927, then saw active development by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) between 1933 and 1935. At that time, trails were laid out and numerous buildings constructed including a dining hall, recreation hall, concession building, and shelters. Three surviving CCC-era structures were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985: the Meramec State Park Lookout House/Observation Tower, the Meramec State Park Pump House, and the Meramec State Park Shelter House. In 1991, the Meramec State Park Beach Area Historic District was also added to the list.\u000aMeramec State Park Lookout House/Observation Tower: It was built about 1934, and is a rustic style, stone and trussed timber octagonal lookout tower.\u000aMeramec State Park Pump House: It was built in 1934, and is a rustic style, stone pump house (well house) on the Lodge Trail.

aVThe one-sex and two-sex theories are two models of human anatomy or fetal development discussed in Thomas Laqueur's book Making Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud. He theorizes that a fundamental change in attitudes toward human sexual anatomy occurred in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. Prior to the eighteenth century, it was a common belief that women and men represented two different forms of one essential sex: that is, women were seen to possess the same fundamental reproductive structure as men, the only difference being that female genitalia was inside the body, not outside of it. Anatomists saw the vagina as an interior penis, the labia as foreskin, the uterus as scrotum, and the ovaries as testicles. However, around the 18th century, the dominant view became that of two sexes directly opposite to each other. There was an abundance of literature written in the 18th century supporting the two-sex model. Jacques-Louis Moreau wrote that "not only are the sexes different, but they are different in every conceivable aspect of body and soul, in every physical and moral aspect. To the physician or the naturalist, the relation of woman to man is a series of opposites and contrasts". Women and men began to be seen as polar opposites and each sex was compared in relation to the other. Gender, prior to the eighteenth century, was not prescribed upon individual; a man could be physically male, but he could have a feminine gender identity. This was seen as being normal and acceptable. With the switch to the two-sex model, differences that had been expressed with reference to gender now came to be expressed with reference to sex and to biology.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The one-sex theory ===\u000aAccording to Laqueur, prior to the eighteenth century it was acknowledged that there were physical differences between the sex organs of men and women, but these differences were never made to be of significance; "no one was much interested in looking for evidence of two distinct sexes, at the anatomical and concrete physiological differences between men and women, until such differences became politically important." Until the beginning of the eighteenth century, Laqueur claims, the one-sex model dominated medical and philosophical literature and there was a web of knowledge to support it.\u000aLaqueur uses examples from ancient thinkers to help support his claim to the dominance of the one-sex model prior to the eighteenth century. He mentions Galen who asks us to "think first, please, of the man's [external genitalia] turned in and extending inward between the rectum and the bladder. If this should happen, the scrotum would necessarily take the place of the uterus with the testes lying outside, next to it on either side." For Galen, "women have exactly the same organs as men, but in exactly the wrong places" Women are seen as less perfect versions of men, albeit still a version of them. Laqueur provides us with Galen's comparison between the eyes of a mole and the genitals of a woman. For Galen "the eyes of the mole have the same structures as the eyes of other animals except that they will not allow the mole to see. They do not open\u2026so to do the female genitalia 'do not open' and remain an imperfect version of what they would be were they thrust out." There were very few specific words associated with either male or female anatomy at the time of Galen. The ancients "regarded organs and their placement as epiphenomena of a greater world order". The absence of words associated with female anatomy shows that people did not want to see a difference between the male and female body. Laqueur argues that philosophers like Aristotle share Galen's views about the one-sex model. Aristotle was committed to the idea of there being two different sexes, but he saw males and females as having certain roles in society, and these roles were not necessarily tied to their bodies. Aristotle said that "all of the male organs are similar in the female except that she has a womb, which presumably, the male does not." Laqueur believes that men and women were seen as comparable variations of one type of sex; that there were many genders at this time, but there was only one sex.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The two-sex theory ===\u000aThe "one-sex/two-sex" theory claims that the switch from the one-sex model to the two-sex model created the foundations of gender as we know them today. The explanations for this shift are both epistemological and political. In terms of the epistemological, in the beginning of the eighteenth century, experts with authority were determining what was natural and what was not. Michel de Montaigne, a writer during the French Renaissance, writes in his Travel Journal, about a group of young girls who dressed up like males and led their lives as males. For him, this was seen as perfectly normal and that "there is no ontological sex, only organs assigned legal and social status". In the two-sex model though, these experts wanted to create a link between biological sex and theoretical gender and anything transgressing these boundaries was seen as being abnormal. Although it was thought in the one-sex model that feminine men may lactate and that "almost all the men have a great quantity of milk in their breasts", the notion of interconvertibility of fluids among men and women was thrown out the window in the two-sex model. Sex became related to physical facts and the uterus became a justification for the status of women. Gender roles became institutionalized and what was meant to be male or female was based on what the experts thought was natural. Philosophers like Rousseau supported this view and he saw women as being relegated to the private sphere as wives and mothers while men dominated the public sphere.\u000aThe "one-sex/two-sex" theory also sees politics as helping to bring about the dominance of the two-sex model. There were endless struggles for power and position occurring between and among men and women. In order to have power over women, men would use sexual anatomy and sexual differences to support their superiority. The subordination of women by men began with the hierarchical ordering of their bodies and ended with their firmly defined gender roles. Thus, "women's protected and conservative role in the household and society was justified by arguments preordained function." Sex was seen as being a major battleground during the French Revolution and "the creation of a bourgeois public sphere...raised with a vengeance the question of which sex(es) ought legitimately to occupy it." Articulate men were the ones who brought about biological evidence to support the notion that women were "unfit for the chimerical spaces that the revolution had inadvertently opened" and thus propagated the notion that women were inferior to men.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Role of science ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The one-sex theory ===\u000aRenaissance anatomical illustrations depicted a woman as a man turned inside out. Male and female organs were often depicted side by side to demonstrate their correspondence to one another. Anatomist and physician Andreas Vesalius, represented women's organs as versions of man's in all three of his influential works. The vagina was often depicted as long, phallic and almost indistinguishable from a penis. Representation of the anatomical difference between men and women were independent of the actual structures of these organs and "ideology, not accuracy of observation, determined how they were seen and which differences would matter." Often, the only way to distinguish a female set of organs from a male set of organs would be if the illustrator were to cut away the front of what appears to be a womb in his drawing to reveal a child inside. This is because "the more Renaissance anatomists dissected, looked into and visually represented the female body, the more powerfully and convincingly they saw it to be a version of the males"\u000aPhysiologically, the one-sex model explains that "in the blood, semen, milk and other fluids of the one-sex body, there is no female and no sharp boundary between the sexes". Different levels of each of the fluids are what would determine gender. The body was also seen as composed of four humours: cold, hot, moist, and dry. Just as with fluid composition, individuals varied in the humoral composition as well. "Though women were always dominated by cold and moist humours, and men by hot and dry humours, difference in sex were seen as differences of degree." In terms of reproduction in the one-sex model, the sex of the child produced by a couple was based on the intermixing of the fluid of a couple. Both males and females were thought to emit a sperm like substance during intercourse. If both partners produce a strong sperm, then a male will result; if both produce weak sperm, a female is born; and if in one partner the battle has gone to the weak and in the other to the strong, then the sex of the offspring is determined by the quantity of sperm produced". It was also thought prior to the eighteenth century by people such as Galen, that in order for a woman to get pregnant, she must have an orgasm.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Role of the female orgasm ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== One-sex theory ===\u000aThe idea of a woman having to have an orgasm in order to conceive was prevalent in the one-sex model. It was thought by people such as Galen that in order for a woman to get pregnant, she must have an orgasm. When a woman would reach an orgasm, the mouth of her womb would open and suck up the male ejaculate like a sponge. It was thought that both males and females experience an orgasm during intercourse and that both released some sort of fluid, which would mix together and the two emissions would result in conception. If women have organs that resemble those of men, and since men obviously experience an orgasm, the woman must too. Women needed to orgasm to produce fluids during intercourse that would stir with the male ejaculate to conceive a child. Laqueur notes that "the fact that women had gonads like men, that they had sexual desires, that they generally produced fluid during intercourse and presumably showed signs of 'delight and concussion', all confirmed the orgasm/conception link." Albrechet von Haller, an eighteenth-century biologist, felt that male and female sexual experiences were the same. He felt this because to him the "analogy of the sexually aroused woman to the sexually aroused man seemed so commonsensical"\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Two-sex theory ===\u000aAs opposed to the one sex model, the two-sex model held that a woman could conceive without an orgasm. At the beginning of Making Sex, Laqueur provides us with the anecdote of a beautiful young woman who was in a deathlike coma. She was raped by a young monk and conceived a child. This story challenges the one sex notion that a woman needs to experience an orgasm in order to conceive. It was also thought prior to the eighteenth century that ovulation corresponded to sexual intercourse. Biologists at this time had very little knowledge of what actually governed the production of an egg. By saying that conception was not related to orgasm, sexual pleasure for women seemed to lose importance. When in the eighteenth century it became a possibility that "the majority of women are not much troubled with sexual feelings, the presence of or absence of orgasm became a biological signpost of sexual difference." Women were to be seen as passionless and not enjoying sex. There was biological evidence around at the time that parts of the female anatomy, specifically the clitoris "contributes a large share, and perhaps the greater part, of the gratification which the female derives from sexual intercourse." Laqueur says that it was "culture and not biology that was the basis for claims bearing on the role and even the existence of female pleasure. The body shifted easily in the eighteenth century from its supposedly foundational role to become not the cause but the sign of gender."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sex socialized ==\u000aThe change from the one sex model to the two-sex model helped to create a new understanding of gender in the meaning of human history. There is an "increasing differentiation of male and female social roles; conversely, a greater differentiation of roles and a greater female 'delicacy and sensibility' are [seen as] signs of moral progress." If men and women are seen as being physically different, then they must be treated differently as well.\u000aIn the two-sex model, since there are physical differences between men and women, there must be differences in how they receive pleasure. Sigmund Freud tries to explain the functions of the clitoris by challenging the preconceived notions about it. Freud feels that "if we are to understand how a little girl turns into a woman, we must further follow the vicissitudes of [the] excitability of the clitoris." He sees the clitoris as being "the organ through which excitement is transmitted to the 'adjacent female sexual parts' to its permanent home, the true locus of a woman's erotic life, the vagina." For Freud he uses the analogy of the clitoris as "pine shavings [used to] set a log of harder wood on fire". For Freud, there is no real female interior if pleasure can transfer from the clitoris to the vagina. Freud tries to provide evidence for a vaginal orgasm and he makes it so a clitoral orgasm is seen to be adolescence. By downplaying the role of the clitoris, he makes women's sexual needs seen as being inferior and secondary to those of men. He says that "whenever a woman is incapable of achieving an orgasm via coitus, provided the husband is an adequate partner, and prefers clitoral stimulation to any other form of sexual activity, she can be regarded as suffering from frigidity and requires psychiatric assistance." In the two-sex model, it is seen that Freud "must be regarded as a narrative of culture in anatomical disguise. The tale of the clitoris is a parable of culture, of how the body is forged into a shape valuable to civilization despite, not because of itself". Freud changed the meaning of the clitoris and contributes to the notion of the passionless woman.\u000aLaqueur says that there was obvious evidence around in Freud's time that the clitoris was in fact the source of pleasure in women. François Mauriceau notes that the clitoris is "where the author of Nature has placed the seat of voluptuousness \u2013 as he has in the glans of the penis \u2013 where the most exquisite sensibility is located, and where he placed the origins of lasciviousness in women." The vagina on the other hand was seen as "a far duller organ" and "only the glands near its outer end are relevant to sexual pleasure because they pour out great quantities of a saline liquor during coitus, which increases the heat and enjoyment of women". By changing the meaning of the clitoral orgasm, Freud seems to be putting women in opposition to men and further assigning women to socially assigned roles. To say that a woman is supposed to orgasm through her vagina as opposed to her clitoris "works against the organic structures of the body." In Laqueur's "one-sex/two-sex" theory, he sees Freud as being instrumental in the sexual socialization of women. He feels that "the cultural myth of vaginal orgasm is told in the language of science. And thus, not thanks to but in spite of neurology, a girl becomes the Viennese bourgeois ideal of a woman."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Bibliography ===

aVGolfsmith International Holdings Inc. was an American golf specialty retailer based in Austin, Texas. Each store, along with golfsmith.com, housed a wide selection of golf clubs, shoes, apparel, gadgets and gear from all the major brands as well as proprietary offerings. They also offered custom club fitting, lessons and services for golfers.\u000aFounded by Carl and Barbara Paul in 1967, Golfsmith began as a custom golf club components supplier. As of August 2014, the company had expanded to comprise over 100 retail stores in over 20 states, selling golf clubs, performance apparel, skills improvement products, etc. Golfsmith generated net revenues of over $338 million in fiscal year 2009.\u000aIn May 2012, Canadian pension fund OMERS announced plans to take over Golfsmith for $6.10 per share, and the transaction was completed in July 2012. OMERS also owns Golf Town, the largest golf retailer in Canada. The two brands operated as Golfsmith International, the largest golf specialty retailer in the world. \u000aOn November 3, 2016, Golfsmith was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy court of Delaware to be acquired by Dick's Sporting Goods after being purchased for 69 million dollars.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aIn 1967, Carl Paul and his wife Barbara Paul founded Golfsmith in their Edison, N.J. home. Inspired by a custom club maker who had built him a tailor-made set, Carl recognized an unfilled niche in the golf industry: the design and distribution of custom golf clubs and their components, along with instruction about how best to assemble them. Beginning with a typewritten, hand illustrated catalog, Golfsmith first became successful by helping transform club repair shops across the country into custom golf club makers.\u000aIn the early 1970s, Carl\u2019s brother Frank joined the family business, and it moved to Austin, Texas. The first Golfsmith storefront was a components showroom housed in 6,000 square feet (560 m2) of unused army barracks. In 1975, the Pauls embarked on their first consumer retail expansion by creating The Golfsmith Store accessory catalog. In 1976, the company first grossed more than $1 million.\u000aGolfsmith operated primarily as a catalog-based business until 1992. That year the company moved to its present headquarters location, a 40-acre campus that includes the corporate offices, a practice range, a 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) Golfsmith store, and 240,000 square feet (22,000 m2) of shipping and distribution facilities.\u000aGolfsmith\u2019s retail expansion began in 1995 with the opening of retail stores in Houston, Denver and Dallas. Golfsmith\u2019s initial public offering of stock was in June 2006. As of August 2014, Golfsmith operated over 100 stores in over 20 states.\u000aIn October 2002, Golfsmith sold a majority share in the company to First Atlantic Capital. On June 15, 2006, Golfsmith International Holdings Inc. made its initial public offering and since has been traded under NASDAQ symbol GOLF.\u000aOn September 14, 2016 Golfsmith International Holdings, Inc filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, owing millions to Nike, Inc, Callaway Golf Company, and others.\u000aOn November 3, 2016, Golfsmith was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy court of Delaware to be acquired by Dick's Sporting Goods after being purchased for 69 million dollars.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Brands ===\u000aGolfsmith offers golf clubs, apparel, accessories and practice gear from brands like Adams Golf, Adidas, Bridgestone, Bushnell, Callaway, Cleveland, Cobra, ECCO, FootJoy, MacGregor, Mizuno, Nike Golf, Odyssey, OGIO, PING, Scotty Cameron, SkyGolf, Srixon, Sun Mountain, TaylorMade, Titleist, and Wilson Staff.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Proprietary Brands ===\u000aIn 1998, Golfsmith secured a $30 million private placement with DLJ Investment Partners. The private placement helped fund the acquisitions of Lynx Golf Inc., Black Rock Golf Corp. (maker of Killer Bee golf clubs) and Snake Eyes Golf Clubs Inc. In 2003, the company acquired Zevo Golf. In May 2009, Golfsmith acquired the intellectual property rights to MacGregor Golf.\u000aAlongside products from external manufacturers, Golfsmith offered complete golf clubs, component club parts, apparel and golf accessories under its own Lynx, MacGregor, Killer Bee, Snake Eyes, Golfsmith, XPC, Zevo, ZTech, Tour Trek, Profinity and MaggieLane brands.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Clubmaking ===\u000aBeginning in 1970, Golfsmith offered the first golf club maker training programs to teach custom club fitting, assembly and repair. Golfsmith now conducts clubmaking schools throughout the year, at three levels of expertise: the Complete Clubmaker\u2019s Training School, the Advanced Clubmaking, Fitting and Repair School, and the Master Craftsman School.\u000aIn 1980, Golfsmith established the Golf Clubmakers Association (GCA) to support and guide the growing number of clubmakers around the world. The GCA offers three levels of professional accreditation: Accredited Clubmaker, Professional Clubmaker and Advanced Clubmaker. In 1988, Golfsmith hosted the first GCA International Conference.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Lessons ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Golfsmith Learning Center ====\u000aIn 1993, Golfsmith collaborated with teacher Harvey Penick to develop the Austin-based Harvey Penick Golf Academy, which instructed golfers in the methods and philosophies of the \u201cLittle Red Golf Book\u201d coauthor. The academy was renamed the Golfsmith Learning Center in 2009.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Partnership with GolfTEC ====\u000aIn 2004, Golfsmith formed a partnership with GolfTEC, a Denver-based national chain of golf instruction facilities. As of August 2010, GolfTEC provided golf lessons in 57 Golfsmith stores.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Tennis Products and Services ==\u000aIn 2003, Golfsmith acquired six San Francisco-based Don Sherwood Golf and Tennis stores and began offering a wide selection of major-brand tennis merchandise. At one point, the company sold tennis gear in over 55 of its stores nationwide, as well as online and via direct-to-consumer marketing. Golfsmith also offered tennis racquet restringing by technicians certified by the United States Racquet Restringers Association. As of 2013, Golfsmith no longer sold nor serviced tennis related products.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Stores ==\u000aAs of August 2014, Golfsmith operated over 100 stores in over 20 states, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.\u000aGolfsmith stores had putting greens, driving ranges and digital swing analysis equipment inside most locations, and tennis courts inside some.\u000aIn 2009, Golfsmith introduced the Golfsmith Xtreme brand of superstores, which is larger, with more interactive features like indoor hitting bays and sand bunkers.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bankruptcy/Ceasing of Operations ==\u000aA few different factors contributed to Golfsmith's bankruptcy, the primary factor being Golfsmith not slowing store openings as its business began to decline. Golfsmith was opening dozens of stores yearly during the 00's while golf was seeing an increase in popularity--mostly attributed to Tiger Woods. Golfsmith took this opportunity to establish itself as the largest golf retailer in North America (164 stores before the bankruptcy). The stores Golfsmith operated were 15,000-40,000 sq. ft each (the average being 23,000 square feet). This led to expensive operating costs, which hurt the company, especially when the golf business began to weaken. Massive amounts of inventory sat in Golfsmith stores losing value as the newer models came out. This was the reason Golfsmith owed $5.5 million to Callaway Golf Co., $5.1 million to Taylormade Golf Co. Inc., $3.5 million to Nike, $2.3 million to PING Inc. and $2.1 million to Titleist. Golfsmith CEO David Roussy blamed "a recession-driven decline in golf participation and an oversized brick-and-mortar retail presence" for its situation. Golfsmith was purchased at auction by Dick's Sporting Goods. Most Golfsmith stores closed on December 28, 2016. Any remaining Golfsmith stores were converted to Dick's Sporting Goods' Golf Galaxy brand. Hilco Liquidation purchased approximately 80 million dollars of Golfsmith's inventory for approximately 8 million dollars. This led to steady price discounts of everything in the stores, including clubmaking shop tools, hitting bays, shelves, and other fixtures. Hilco dropped prices up to 95% off the original retail price in the final hours of operation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Website, Mobile Devices and Social Media ==\u000aGolfsmith\u2019s website, golfsmith.com, offers online shopping, product reviews by customers, streaming videos about products, and services such as golf handicap tracking and live online customer service.\u000aIn 2007 and 2008, golfsmith.com was cited for exemplary customer service in the E-tailing Group\u2019s annual Mystery Shopping Survey. In 2009 and 2010, Internet Retailer put golfsmith.com on its \u201cHot 100\u201d list of the best e-commerce sites.\u000aIn 2010, Golfsmith launched a new mobile website and iPhone application. The company uses both Facebook and Twitter to reach customers.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Catalogs ==\u000aGolfsmith published and distributed multiple print catalog titles throughout the year, including a general golf equipment catalog, one for custom golf club makers and one offering only tennis products. The company was the first golf retailer to publish a catalog of equipment and fashion exclusively for women.\u000a\u000a\u000a== International Operations ==\u000aGolfsmith operated Golfsmith Canada LLC, a club components distribution center in Ontario, Canada.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial website (Archive)

Ladram Bay lies just under 2 miles southwest of Sidmouth and about 2.5 miles northeast of Budleigh Salterton. Directly southwest of Ladram Bay are Smallstones Point and Chiselbury Bay. To the east is a hill called High Peak and below the hill are the Hern Point and Big Picket Rocks.\u000aThe holiday park at Ladram Bay is the second largest holiday centre in Devon.

The localities along the Jurassic Coast includes a large range of important fossil zones.\u000asee also: List of places on the Jurassic Coast\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geology ==\u000aAmong the most impressive sights along the Jurassic Coast are the sea stacks at Ladram Bay. The sandstones contain numerous vertical fractures and joints that were formed deep in the Earths crust during past mountain building periods. The sea picked out these planes of weakness to form caves and natural arches that have since collapsed to produce sea stacks. The \u201cOtter Sandstone\u201d that forms the cliffs and sea stacks were deposited in a hot dry climates in the Triassic Period about 220 Million years ago. The stacks are composed of the same rock, which is relatively soft, but they have a harder band of sandstone at their base which prevents their rapid erosion by the sea. The striking red colour of the rock is caused by iron oxide, which tells us that the layers were formed in a desert. The presence of ripple marks and channels in the sandstones, together with the remains of the long-extinct plants, insects, fish, amphibians and reptiles, show that the desert was crossed by fertile river valleys.\u000aThe \u201cOtter Sandstone\u201d is the richest source of Triassic reptile remains in Britain and one of the most important in the world. At the south-west end of the bay, the most common fossils in the sandstone are networks of vertical, tube-like carbonate petrifactions (rhizocretions): these represent the roots of plants that were able to survive in the harsh dry climate of the Triassic Period.\u000aThe bay is sited on the same band of Sandstone that forms the oil reservoir at the Wytch Farm oilfield on the Isle of Purbeck.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a\u000aMap sources for Ladram Bay

aVLuis de Unzaga y Amezaga (1721\u20131790), also known as Luis Unzaga y Amezaga, was a Spanish governor of Louisiana from late 1769 to mid-1777, as well as a Captain General of Venezuela and Cuba.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aUnzaga was born in Málaga, Spain, the son of a well-known Basque family. He served in the Italian war of 1735 and went to Havana in 1740, where he was appointed lieutenant governor of Puerto Principe, Cuba and later of Santiago de Cuba. During the Seven Years' War he defended Havana against a British siege, in 1762.\u000aUnzaga accompanied Alejandro O'Reilly to New Orleans in 1769 to put down the Rebellion of 1768 by French and German colonists objecting to the cessation of Louisiana to Spain via the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762). Following the formal establishment of the cabildo (council), Unzaga became governor on December 1, 1769. In 1770, he married Marie Elizabeth de St. Maxent, second daughter of Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent, the wealthiest man in Louisiana.\u000aUnzaga was noted for allowing open trade. During the summer of 1776, he secretly helped the Americans by privately delivering five tons of gunpowder from the king's stores to Captain George Gibson and Lieutenant Linn of the Virginia Council of Defense. The gunpowder moved up the Mississippi under the protection of the flag of Spain and was used to thwart British plans to capture Fort Pitt.\u000aFrom June 17, 1777, to December 10, 1782, Unzaga served as Captain General of Venezuela. In 1783 he became governor of Cuba, where one of his first actions was ordering a halt to the unrestrained cutting of cedar trees.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVFinch were an Australian hard and pub rock band, initially forming as Stillwater in 1972. By 1973 they had changed their name with the line-up of Peter McFarlane on drums, Owen Orford on lead vocals, Bob Spencer on lead guitar, and Tony Strain on bass guitar. They won a 2SM/Pepsi Pop Poll, earning a contract with Picture Records to release their debut single, "And She Sings" in January 1974. Their first album, Thunderbird, appeared in May 1976. In March of the following year Spencer left to join Skyhooks and the group went through various line-ups to settle with McFarlane and Orford joined by Mark Evans (ex AC/DC) on bass guitar. Their second album, Nothing to Hide, was issued in March 1978. Upon attempting to enter the international market they changed their name to Contraband by October that year. They issued a self-titled album in May of the next year but disbanded later in 1979.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aStillwater formed in 1972 in Sydney as a hard rock band and by the following year had changed their name to Finch. The line-up of Finch was Peter McFarlane on drums, Owen Orford on lead vocals, Bob Spencer on lead guitar, and Tony Strain on bass guitar. They won a 2SM/Pepsi Pop Poll, earning a contract with Picture Records. The group released their first single, "And She Sings", in January 1974 while Spencer was still in high school. Finch contributed to the soundtrack album for the surfing film, Drouyn (August 1974), which featured world champion, Peter Drouyn. Finch's tracks, "Sail Away", "Lady of Truth" and "Roses" were used in contrast to "jazzy incidental material". The Canberra Times' Michael Foster noted the "sound is no less compelling, and perhaps is more evocative because it is less insistent on the one beat and theme".\u000aThe band worked in the pub rock circuit and released a self-financed album, Thunderbird, in May 1976 on Eagle Records. It was produced by John Zulaikha (Buffalo), Brian Todd (their manager) and the band. Tony Catterall of The Canberra Times felt it was "not without its merits" as the group "are always at least exuberant", however "[it] suffers sadly from a lack of originality (Free, Status Quo and Black Sabbath influences abound), naivety in the lyrics and poor production". Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, noted the group "had a good deal of English-flavoured blues and hard rock buzzing around in their systems". In December they released a single, "Short Changed Again", which peaked at number 29 on the Sydney chart. As the single gained notice their distribution company foundered.\u000aLate in 1976 Finch moved to Melbourne and supported a national tour by Supernaut. In March 1977 Spencer left to replace Red Symons on guitar in Skyhooks. Tony Strain left the band at the same time. From April to July the band went through nine different members (including Sam Mallett, Skeeta Pereira, Gary Quince, and Graham Thompson) before Peter McFarlane and Orford were joined by Mark Evans (ex AC/DC) on bass guitar, Graham Kennedy on guitar and vocals, and Chris Jones on guitars. The band signed to CBS / Epic Records and issued the single, "One More Time" in October. They started recording material for their second album, Nothing to Hide, in the following month. Dave Hinds (ex-Marshall Brothers, Rabbit) replaced Chris Jones (who joined Feather) on guitar and vocals in December.\u000aThe band adopted a more hard rock style, and the next single, "Where Were You?" reached number 14 in Melbourne and number 33 in Sydney in February 1978. Nothing to Hide (March) was produced by Peter Dawkins (Dragon) and provided a second single, the title track (May). The Canberra Times' Luis Feliu opined that they continued to provide "punchy rock and roll and a bit of R and B, the British way ... However, Finch's style has now become overworked to the point of being uninteresting". Finch signed with CBS's United States subsidiary label, Portrait Records. Due to a Dutch band also called Finch, the Australian group were renamed as Contraband.\u000aIn October 1978 Portrait issued Contraband's debut single, "That's Your Way" and Barry Cram (ex-Pantha, Avalanche, Russell Morris Band) replaced McFarlane on drums, who joined Swanee. In May the following year an album, Contraband was released, which was also produced by Dawkins. Some interest was generated in the US but the album was not successful in Australia. It provided two singles "Rainin' Again" (March 1979) and "Gimme Some Lovin'" (July) \u2013 which is a cover of The Spencer Davis Group 1966 single. Earlier Finch material was re-released under the Contraband name.

The rope was situated so that the bottom of the rope was above the heads of the athletes so that they had to jump up to grab the rope and do the first pulls without using their legs. The final movement was pushing what was called a "snail," a large heavy barrel that had to be rolled for 40 feet. The event was won Samantha Briggs and Brent Fikowski.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Event 9: The Separator ====\u000aThis event was performed in a different order for the Men and Women's competition.\u000aMen's Event 9\u000a12 ring handstand push-ups\u000a15 back squats at 225 pounds\u000a20 burpees\u000a9 ring handstand push-ups\u000a18 front squats at 205 pounds\u000a20 burpees\u000a6 ring handstand push-ups\u000a21 overhead squats at 185 pounds\u000a20 burpees\u000aWomen's Event 9\u000a15 back squats at 165 pounds\u000a20 burpees\u000a6 ring handstand push-ups\u000a18 front squats at 145 pounds\u000a20 burpees\u000a4 ring handstand push-ups\u000a21 overhead squats at 125 pounds\u000a20 burpees\u000a2 ring handstand push-ups\u000aThe handstand push-ups where done in gymnastic rings and it was the second time the movement has been done at the CrossFit Games.

The Facebook post announcing the decision attracted more than 4,000 comments, with many members drawing attention to the recent spate of mass shootings in the US. One Facebook user wrote "As a reward for fitness you can potentially shoot people?...After the worst mass shootings in USA, I hardly feel bringing a community together via guns is in the spirit of Crossfit. Shameful." Title sponsor Reebok said in a statement: "While we understand CrossFit\u2019s foundations are tied to military and first responders, we do not agree with this decision, particularly in light of current events in the United States." A Change.org petition gathered more than 19,000 signatures against the partnership with Glock. In response to the criticism, director of the games, Dave Castro said, \u201cI am one of millions of people in the U.S. who own guns for recreational and legal purposes. I compete in competitive shooting events, and I have a lot of friends in the shooting industry. Glock offered up pistols as prizes, I agreed to it.\u201d Castro later added, \u201cUnless the state and federal laws regarding gun ownership in California and the U.S. change in the next week, then no, nothing is changing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aCrossFit\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Classen Library (Danish: Det Classenske Bibliotek) was a public library in Copenhagen, Denmark, created from the private book collection of Johan Frederik Classen at the time of his death in 1792. It was the third largest library in the city, surpassed only by the Royal Danish Library and Copenhagen University Library and existed until 1867 when it was merged with the latter.\u000aIts building at 38 Amaliegade now houses Det Konserveringsfaglige Videncenter, a centre for conservation. It was listed in 1918.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aThe successful industrialist and landowner Johan Frederik Classen was an enthusiastic bibliophile, buying books both at home and abroad, until he had a library. At the time of his death, he left his book collection to the public. It consisted of some 20,000 volumes. The library was to receive an annual sum of 3,000 rigsdaler from the Classenske Fideicommis, a charitable foundation which he set up in his will. Classen's brother, Peter Hersleb Classen, paid for the construction of a library building in Amaliegade, opposite Frederick's Hospital and not far from Amalienborg Palace. The library's collections grew to about 30,000 volumes in the middle of the 19th century.\u000aIn 1867 the library was merged with Copenhagen University Library which changed its name to Københavns Universitetsbibliotek og det dermed forenede Classenske Bibliotek.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Architecture ==\u000aThe library was built to Peter Hersleb Classen's own design, presumably assisted by Andreas Kirkerup. The facade has rustication on the ground floor and a loggia with eight columns, showing influence from Ancient Roman architecture. The central library hall is two storeys high and surrounded by double galleries. It contains a bust of Classen.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Today ==\u000aToday the building houses Konserveringsfagligt Videncenter (KViC), the library of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts' School of Conservation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aDen Classenske Legatskole\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aClassenske Bibliotek at arkark.dk\u000aImages from works\u000aBirds of America

aVOseltamivir, sold under the brand name Tamiflu, is an antiviral medication used to treat and prevent influenza A and influenza B (flu). Many medical organizations recommend it in people who have complications or are at high risk of complications within 48 hours of first symptoms of infection. They recommend it to prevent infection in those at high risk, but not the general population. The CDC recommends that clinicians use their discretion to treat those at lower risk who present within 48 hours of first symptoms of infection. It is taken by mouth, either as a pill or liquid.\u000aRecommendations regarding oseltamivir are controversial as are criticisms of the recommendations. A 2014 Cochrane review concluded that oseltamivir does not reduce hospitalizations, and that there is no evidence of reduction in complications of influenza. Two meta-analyses have concluded that benefits in those who are otherwise healthy do not outweigh its risks. They also found little evidence regarding whether treatment changes the risk of hospitalization or death in high risk populations. However, another meta-analysis found that oseltamivir was effective for prevention of influenza at the individual and household levels.\u000aCommon side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and trouble sleeping. Other side effects may include psychiatric symptoms and seizures. In the United States it is recommended for influenza infection during pregnancy. It has been taken by a small number of pregnant women without signs of problems. Dose adjustment may be needed in those with kidney problems.\u000aOseltamivir was approved for medical use in the US in 1999. It was the first neuraminidase inhibitor available by mouth. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines (complementary list), the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. A generic version was approved in the US in 2016. As of 2014 the wholesale cost in the developing world was about US$4.27 per day. As of December 2016, a treatment course cost US$138.70 in the U.S.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Medical use ==\u000a\u000aOseltamivir is used for the prevention and treatment of influenza caused by influenza A and B viruses. It is on the complementary list of the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system. Oseltamivir's risk-benefit ratio is controversial. In 2017 it was moved from the core to the complementary list based on its lower cost-effectiveness.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== High-risk people ===\u000aThe United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Public Health England and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend the use of oseltamivir for people who have complications or are at high risk for complications. This includes those who are hospitalized, young children, those over the age of 65, people with other significant health problems, those who are pregnant, and Indigenous peoples of the Americas among others. The Infectious Disease Society of America takes the same position as the CDC.\u000aA systematic review of systematic reviews in PLoS One did not find evidence for benefits in people who are at risk, noting that "the trials were not designed or powered to give results regarding serious complications, hospitalization and mortality", as did a 2014 Cochrane review. The Cochrane review further recommended: "On the basis of the findings of this review, clinicians and healthcare policy-makers should urgently revise current recommendations for use of the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) for individuals with influenza." That is not utilizing NIs for prevention or treatment "Based on these findings there appears to be no evidence for patients, clinicians or policy-makers to use these drugs to prevent serious outcomes, both in annual influenza and pandemic influenza outbreaks."\u000aThe CDC, ECDC, Public Health England, Infectious Disease Society of America, the AAP, and Roche (the originator) reject the conclusions of the Cochrane review, arguing in part that the analysis inappropriately forms conclusions about outcomes in people who are seriously ill based on results obtained primarily in healthy populations, and that the analysis inappropriately included results from people not infected with influenza. The EMA did not change its labelling of the drug in response to the Cochrane study.\u000aA 2014 review in the New England Journal of Medicine had recommended that all people admitted to intensive care units during influenza outbreaks with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia receive oseltamivir until the absence of influenza infection is established by PCR testing.\u000aA 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis found oseltamivir effective at treating the symptoms of influenza, reducing the length of hospitalization, and reducing the risk of otitis media. The same review found that oseltamivir did not significantly increase the risk of adverse events. A 2016 systematic review found that oseltamivir slightly reduced the time it takes for the symptoms of influenza to be alleviated, and that it also increased the risk of "nausea, vomiting, [and] psychiatric events in adults and vomiting in children."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Otherwise healthy people ===\u000aIn those who are otherwise healthy the CDC states that antivirals may be considered within the first 48 hours. A German clinical practice guideline recommends against its use.\u000aTwo 2013 meta-analyses have concluded that benefits in those who are otherwise healthy do not outweigh its risks. When the analysis was restricted to people with confirmed infection, a Cochrane review found unclear evidence of change in the risk of complications such as pneumonia, while three other reviews found a decreased risk. Together, published studies suggest that oseltamivir reduces the duration of symptoms by 0.5\u20131 day. Any benefit of treatment must be balanced against side effects, which include psychiatric symptoms and increased rates of vomiting.\u000aA 2014 Cochrane Collaboration review concluded that oseltamivir did not affect the need for hospitalizations, and that there is no proof of reduction of complications of influenza (such as pneumonia) because of a lack of diagnostic definitions, or reduction of the spread of the virus. There was also evidence that suggested that oseltamivir prevented some people from producing sufficient numbers of their own antibodies to fight infection. The authors recommended that guidance should be revised to take account of the evidence of small benefit and increased risk of harms.\u000aThe US and European Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Public Health England, Infectious Disease Society of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, and Roche (the originator) rejected the recommendations of the 2014 Cochrane review to urgently change treatment guidelines and drug labels.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Prevention ===\u000aAs of 2017, the CDC does not recommend to use oseltamivir generally for prevention due to concerns that widespread use will encourage resistance development. They recommend that it be considered in those at high risk, who have been exposed to influenza within 48 hours and have not received or only recently been vaccinated. They recommended it during outbreaks in long term care facilities and in those who are significantly immunosuppressed.\u000aAs of 2011, reviews concluded that when oseltamivir is used preventatively it decreases the risk of exposed people developing symptomatic disease. A systematic review of systematic reviews found low to moderate evidence that it decreases the risk of getting symptomatic influenza by 1% to 12% (a relative decrease of 64 to 92%). It recommended against its use in healthy, low-risk persons due to cost, the risk of resistance development, and side effects and concluded it might be useful for prevention in unvaccinated high risk persons.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Side effects ==\u000a\u000aCommon adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with oseltamivir therapy (occurring in over 1 percent of people) include nausea and vomiting. In adults, oseltamivir increased the risk of nausea for which the number needed to harm was 28 and for vomiting was 22. So, for every 22 adult people on oseltamivir one experienced vomiting. In the treatment of children, oseltamivir also induced vomiting. The number needed to harm was 19. So, for every 19 children on oseltamivir one experienced vomiting. In prevention there were more headaches, kidney, and psychiatric events. Oseltamivir's effect on the heart is unclear: it may reduce cardiac symptoms, but may also induce serious heart rhythm problems.\u000aPostmarketing reports include liver inflammation and elevated liver enzymes, rash, allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, abnormal heart rhythms, seizure, confusion, aggravation of diabetes, and haemorrhagic colitis and Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome.\u000aThe U.S. and EU package inserts for oseltamivir contain a warning of psychiatric effects observed in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency of these appears to be low and a causative role for oseltamivir has not been established. The 2014 Cochrane review found a dose-response effect on psychiatric events. In trials of prevention in adults one person was harmed for every 94 treated. Neither of the two most cited published treatment trials of oseltamivir reported any drug-attributable serious adverse events.\u000aIt is pregnancy category C in the United States and category B in Australia, meaning that it has been taken by a small number of women without signs of problems and in animal studies it looks safe. Dose adjustment may be needed in those with kidney problems.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Mechanism of action ==\u000aOseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, a competitive inhibitor of influenza's neuraminidase enzyme. The enzyme cleaves the sialic acid which is found on glycoproteins on the surface of human cells, and helps new virions to exit them. Thus oseltamivir prevents new viral particles from being released.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Resistance ==\u000aThe vast majority of mutations conferring resistance are single amino acid residue substitutions (His274Tyr in N1) in the neuraminidase enzyme. A 2011 meta-analysis of 15 studies found a pooled incidence rate for oseltamivir resistance of 2.6%. Subgroup analyses detected higher rates among influenza A patients, especially the H1N1 subtype. It was found that a substantial number of patients might become oseltamivir-resistant as a result of oseltamivir use, and that oseltamivir resistance might be significantly associated with pneumonia. In severely immunocompromised patients there were reports of prolonged shedding of oseltamivir- (or zanamivir)-resistant virus, even after oseltamivir treatment was stopped.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== H1N1 flu or "Swine flu" ===\u000aAs of December 15, 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 314 samples of the prevalent 2009 pandemic H1N1 flu tested worldwide have shown resistance to oseltamivir.\u000aThe CDC found sporadic oseltamivir-resistant 2009 H1N1 virus infections had been identified, including with rare episodes of limited transmission, but the public health impact had been limited. Those sporadic cases of resistance were found in immunosuppressed patients during oseltamivir treatment and persons who developed illness while receiving oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis.\u000aDuring 2011 a new influenza A(H1N1)2009 variant with mildly reduced oseltamivir (and zanamivir) sensitivity was detected in more than 10% of community specimens in Singapore and more than 30% of samples from northern Australia.\u000aWhile there is concern that antiviral resistance may develop in people with haematologic malignancies due to their inability to reduce viral loads and several surveillance studies found oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 after administration of oseltamivir in those people, as of November 2013 widespread transmission of oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 has not occurred.\u000aDuring the 2007\u201308 flu season, the US CDC found 10.9% of H1N1 samples (n=1,020) to be resistant. In the 2008\u201309 season, the proportion of resistant H1N1 increased to 99.4%, while no other seasonal strains (H3N2, B) showed resistance.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Seasonal flu ===\u000aFrom 2009 to 2014 oseltamivir resistance was very low in seasonal flu. In the 2010\u201311 flu season, 99.1% of H1N1, 99.8% of H3N, and 100% of Influenza B remained oseltamivir susceptible in the US. In January 2012, the US and European CDCs reported all seasonal flu samples tested since October 2011 to be oseltamivir susceptible. In the 2013\u201314 season only 1% of 2009 H1N1 viruses showed oseltamivir resistance. No other influenza viruses were resistant to oseltamivir.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== H3N2 ===\u000aThree studies have found resistance in 0%, 3.3%, and 18% of subjects. In the study with the 18% resistance rate, the subjects were children, many of whom had not been previously exposed to influenza and therefore had a weakened immune response; the results suggest that higher and earlier dosing may be necessary in such populations.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Influenza B ===\u000aIn 2007, Japanese investigators detected neuraminidase-resistant influenza B virus strains in individuals not treated with these drugs. The prevalence was 1.7 percent. According to the CDC, as of October 3, 2009 no influenza B strains tested have shown any resistance to oseltamivir.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== H5N1 Avian influenza "Bird flu" ===\u000aAs of 2013 H274Y and N294S mutations that confer resistance to oseltamivir have been identified in a few H5N1 isolates from infected patients treated with oseltamivir, and have emerged spontaneously in Egypt.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== H7N9 Avian influenza ===\u000aAs of 2013 two of 14 adults infected with A(H7N9) and treated with oseltamivir developed oseltamivir-resistant virus with the Arg292Lys mutation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Pharmacokinetics ==\u000aIts oral bioavailability is over 80% and is extensively metabolised to its active form upon first-pass through the liver. It has a volume of distribution of 23-26 litres. Its half-life is about 1\u20133 hours and its active carboxylate metabolite has a half-life of 6\u201310 hours. More than 90% of the oral dose is eliminated in the urine as the active metabolite.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aOseltamivir was discovered by scientists at Gilead using shikimic acid as a starting point for synthesis; shikimic acid was originally available only as an extract of Chinese star anise; but by 2006, 30% of the supply was manufactured recombinantly in E. coli. Gilead exclusively licensed their relevant patents to Roche in 1996. The drug's patent has not been protected in Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and several other countries.\u000aIn 1999, the FDA approved oseltamivir phosphate for treatment of influenza in adults based on two double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. In June 2002 EMA approved oseltamivir phosphate for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza. In 2003 a pooled analysis of 10 randomised clinical trials concluded that oseltamivir reduced the risk of lower respiratory tract infections resulting in antibiotic use and hospital admissions in adults.\u000aOseltamivir (as Tamiflu) was widely used during the H5N1 avian influenza epidemic in Southeast Asia in 2005. In response to the epidemic, various governments \u2013 including those of the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, United States, and Australia \u2013 stockpiled quantities of oseltamivir in preparation for a possible pandemic and there were worldwide shortages of the drug, driven by the high demand for stockpiling. In November 2005, U.S. President George W. Bush requested that Congress fund US$1 billion for the production and stockpile of oseltamivir, after Congress had already approved $1.8 billion for military use of the drug. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was a past chairman of Gilead Sciences, recused himself from all government decisions regarding the drug.\u000aIn 2006, a Cochrane review raised controversy by concluding that oseltamivir should not be used during routine seasonal influenza because of its low effectiveness.\u000aIn December 2008, the Indian drug company Cipla won a case in India's court system allowing it to manufacture a cheaper generic version of Tamiflu, called Antiflu. In May 2009, Cipla won approval from the WHO certifying that its drug Antiflu was as effective as Tamiflu, and Antiflu is included in the WHO list of prequalified medicinal products.\u000a\u000aIn 2009, a new A/H1N1 influenza virus was discovered to be spreading in North America. In June 2009 WHO declared the A/H1N1 influenza a pandemic. NICE, the CDC, WHO, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention maintained their recommendation to use oseltamivir.\u000aFrom 2010 to 2012, Cochrane requested Roche's full clinical study reports of their trials, which they did not provide. In 2011, a freedom of information request to the European Medicines Agency provided Cochrane with reports from 16 Roche oseltamivir trials. In 2012, the Cochrane team published an interim review based on those reports. In 2013, Roche released 77 full clinical study reports of oseltamivir trials after GSK released the data on zanamivir studies. In 2014, Cochrane published an updated review based solely on full clinical study reports and regulatory documents. In 2016, Roche's oseltamivir patents began to expire.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Veterinary use ==\u000aThere have been reports of oseltamivir reducing disease severity and hospitalization time in canine parvovirus infection. The drug may limit the ability of the virus to invade the crypt cells of the small intestine and decrease gastrointestinal bacterial colonization and toxin production.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aAmantadine and rimantadine \u2014 M2 inhibitors, other medications used for influenza treatment\u000aBaloxavir marboxil, an endonuclease inhibitor, for influenza treatment, being developed by Shionogi Co.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aPollack, Andrew (November 5, 2005).

aVUSS Wood County (LST-1178) was a De Soto County-class tank landing ship built for the United States Navy during the late 1950s. Named after counties in Ohio, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name.\u000aWood County was laid down on 1 October 1956, at Lorain, Ohio by the American Ship Building Company; launched on 14 December 1957; sponsored by Miss Margaret Ackerman, daughter of the president of the American Shipbuilding Company; and commissioned on 5 August 1959 at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia with Commander Maxton M. Midgett in command.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Service history ==\u000aOn Jan 1961, MCB 7 was transported to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for a deployment.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Mediterranean, 1960\u20131962 ===\u000aFollowing her shakedown and initial operations on the Atlantic seaboard, Wood County was deployed to the Mediterranean for the first time in the summer of 1960, as part of Amphibious Squadron (PhibRon) 2. She subsequently conducted her second deployment to the 6th Fleet in the autumn of 1961 after escorting to division of ocean minesweepers from the east coast to the Mediterranean. During that deployment, the tank landing ship visited Polensa Bay, Majorca, Spain and the British Crown Colony of Malta, where she embarked a detachment of British commandos that she eventually landed at Bomba, Libya during an exercise. In addition, the ship also visited Valencia, Rota, and Barcelona, Spain; Messina and La Spezia, Italy; Cannes, France; and Piles and Athens, Greece before she returned to Little Creek, Virginia, her home port, in February 1962. On 1 April 1962 Wood County was transferred to PhibRon 12. Later that month, the tank landing ship participated in a large scale demonstration exercise off Little Creek, an evolution witnessed by President John F. Kennedy and the Shah of Iran. Immediately thereafter, Wood County proceeded to Vieques, Puerto Rico where she participated in Atlantic Fleet Amphibious Exercise 1-62.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962 ===\u000aWood County underwent a regular overhaul at Newport News, Virginia, from June to August, 1962 before she stood out to sea for trials and refresher training. The tank landing ship deployed to the Caribbean to take part in amphibious brigade exercises and then to become part of the "Caribbean Ready Squadron." In the autumn of 1962, after American aerial reconnaissance disclosed the presence of Soviet offensive missiles in Cuba, President Kennedy insisted that the missiles be withdrawn and imposed a "quarantine" on Cuba. Wood County participated in that operation off the Cuban coast which ended after the Soviet Union removed the missiles.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Atlantic Fleet, 1963\u20131964 ===\u000aThe warship began the new year 1963 in the familiar tropical climes of the Caribbean but soon sailed for the Mediterranean. During this deployment, she served as part of the 6th Fleet's amphibious strike force and visited Italian, French, and Spanish ports during the course of her tour. She participated in "Operation Southtrap," a NATO exercise in which she embarked and landed 1,000 Turkish troops with their vehicles. Other landing exercises were held with NATO forces in Turkey, Sardinia, Majorca, and Greece. She returned home to Little Creek on 19 October 1963.\u000aFollowing upkeep and type training evolutions, Wood County shifted to Davisville, Rhode Island to load Mobile Construction Battalion (CB or SeaBee) 4. She transported the Seabees to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and carried Mobile CB Battalion 1 from Guantanamo back to Davisville on the return voyage. The following month, the tank landing ship took part in routine Caribbean exercises and, upon completion, took part in a pair of successive Atlantic Fleet amphibious exercises. That summer, in August, Wood County participated in a special balloon-launch in a joint Navy-Air Force project before undergoing overhaul and upkeep at Charleston and Jacksonville, respectively.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Dominican intervention, 1965 ===\u000aAfter a lengthy in-port period, Wood County departed Little Creek in April, 1965 for what promised to be a routine Caribbean deployment. Exercise "Quick Kick VII" took place soon thereafter, before the ship put into San Juan, Puerto Rico to allow the crew liberty. Departing San Juan shortly thereafter, the tank landing ship received urgent orders to sail for the Dominican Republic. There, a coup to return the ousted former President, Juan Bosch, to power, had developed into a bloody civil war when communist elements took control of the pro-Bosch movement to turn it toward their own ends. Heavy fighting developed in and around the capital city of Santo Domingo, prompting President Lyndon B. Johnson to order American marines to the Caribbean isle to halt the coup and protect American lives.\u000aWood County's task was to evacuate American nationals threatened by the strife in the capital city. To do this, the tank landing ship put into Puerto de Haina (nine miles from the center of Santo Domingo) and took on board 415 passengers for passage to Puerto Rico. Wood County disembarked the refugees at San Juan and returned to the Dominican Republic with marines and a few newspapermen embarked. En route, the ship transferred the newsmen to the Boxer (LPH-4) before she landed the marines in an amphibious operation near Santo Domingo. Moving to Puerto de Haina for the second time, Wood County embarked 1,013 more refugees and ferried them to San Juan. Upon completion of this task, Wood County remained in the vicinity, on patrol duty in a stand-by status, until she returned north and put into Little Creek on 30 June.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Mediterranean , 1966\u20131967 ===\u000aWood County operated locally off the Virginia Capes into February 1966. She later transported an engineering battalion to Vieques before commencing a restricted availability in April. During July, the tank landing ship operated between Santo Domingo and San Juan. In September and October, the ship prepared for an impending Mediterranean deployment. Wood County escorted Naval Ocean going tugs across the Atlantic to the Mediterranean; and lifted the 3rd Battalion, 8th Engineers, to Rota, Spain, before she participated in a combined amphibious assault with French units at Lovo Santo, Corsica in November 1966. The tank landing ship took part in an amphibious exercise off Sardinia in January 1967 and in two more during March before undertaking a role in a joint amphibious evolution with ships of the Italian Navy at Tagliamento, Italy and another exercise off Sardinia in April.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== In reserve, 1967\u20131970 ===\u000aOn her return voyage to the United States in May, 1967 Wood County offloaded Marines and equipment at Morehead City and then entered the Baltimore Shipyard for an overhaul which lasted from June, 1967 to September, 1968. The tank landing ship then was placed in reserve operating status in December 1967 to be effective until January, 1970. During this reserve period, Wood County operated in a restricted operating status and with a reduced manning level, due to the problems associated with the ship's main propulsion system, the six Fairbanks Morse diesel engines. While Wood County remained pier side at Little Creek for the greater part of 1969, her crew labored to preserve and maintain the ship and conducted training on board and on shore. The tank landing ship was also used as a demonstration ship for the amphibious school (a stationary training aid) through the summer of 1969. Groups of students from the school came on board periodically to tour the LST-type vessel.\u000aOn 2 September 1969, Wood County proceeded to the Home Brothers Shipyard at Newport News to have the six Cooper Bessemer engines replaced by a like number of Fairbanks-Morse diesels. The work progressed well into the spring of 1970. On 15 June the tank landing ship successfully completed her sea trials and, on the 19th, officially competed her yard period at Newport News. On the 20th, she set out on her two-week shakedown cruise. On Sunday, 21 June, Wood County sighted a red flare and altered course to investigate. She found that the 36-foot sailboat Hiro had been adrift for three days due to a rudder casualty, and she rescued the two occupants. Six days later, Wood County performed her second rescue of the week when she hauled on board two men from a small fishing boat which had been the object of a massive search by United States Coast Guard ships and planes for the past three days.\u000aFrom August to October, 1970, Wood County underwent shakedown and amphibious refresher training under the auspices of the Atlantic Fleet Amphibious Operational Training Unit. From 16 to 26 October, the tank landing ship provided transportation and berthing for representatives of many amphibious type commands at the Philadelphia Naval Base for participation in a firefighting school conducted there at the time. Wood County underwent type training, acting as control ship for drone aircraft used in various gunnery exercises by the ships in PhibRon 6. Returning to port, Wood County soon commenced a tender availability in preparation for the ship's first Mediterranean deployment in four years.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Mediterranean, 1971 ===\u000a16 January 1971 the ship's cargo\u2014two PCF "Swift boats" and a pair of Ammi pontoons\u2014were secured and ready for sea. This was the first instance of Ammi pontoons being side-loaded on a tank landing ship for a transoceanic voyage. Wood County stood out of Little Creek on 19 January, bound for Malta and Crete. The tank landing ship made port at Valletta, Malta on 6 February and off-loaded the two Swift patrol craft. Those boats were to be used by the Maltese government to combat smuggling off the island's coasts. Departing the same day, Wood County pressed on for Crete and arrived two days later. There, she turned the two 54-ton Ammi pontoons over to the Royal Hellenic Navy for use in extending a pier in the harbor at Souda Bay.\u000a\u000aDeparting Souda Bay on 9 February Wood County returned home via Barcelona and Gibraltar and arrived at Little Creek on 28 February. However, soon after returning to her home port, Wood County began preparations to return to the Mediterranean. The coming deployment would be especially significant, as Wood County had been assigned the task of support ship to the product of the Navy's newest developments in hydrofoil technology, the gunboat Tucumcari (PGH-2). On 22 March 1971, Tucumcari was deck-loaded piggyback on board Wood County; and, three days later, the tank landing ship sailed from Little Creek, bound for the first stop on the special demonstration deployment. Over the ensuing months, Wood County and Tucumcari visited seven NATO nations and 16 ports: Copenhagen and Frederikshavn, Denmark; Kiel and Olpenitz, Germany; Portsmouth and the Isle of Portland, England; and Rendsburg, Germany. Then, after a transit of the Kiel Canal, she stopped at Rosyth, Scotland; Brest and Toulon, France; Naples, Brindisi, La Spezia, and Augusta, Sicily; Athens, Greece; and Gölcük, Turkey. Tucumcari was demonstrated in hopes that NATO would develop a guided-missile hydrofoil weapons system. In addition to providing a base of operations and facilities for briefings and discussions between United States liaison officers and foreign representatives, Wood County provided logistics support, messing and berthing facilities, and engaged in numerous public relations efforts to promote international goodwill. The performance of Wood County and Tucumcari both elicited praise from the Chief of Naval Operations; Commander Amphibious Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet; the United States NATO Mission; Commander in Chief, United States Naval Forces Europe, and others.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Decommissioning and scrapping, 1972\u20131989 ===\u000aUpon Wood County's return, she offloaded Tucumcari and began preparations for a Board of Inspection and Survey inspection in November. Following that, Wood County was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 15 February 1972. On 1 May 1972, Wood County was decommissioned. Wood County was berthed in the James River, part of the National Defense Reserve Fleet, in temporary custody of the Maritime Administration, from 1972 to July 1977. After that date, the tank landing ship was shifted to the Portsmouth berthing area, where she remained until struck from the Naval Vessel Register 16 February 1989. Wood County was scrapped in July 2002 at Transforma Marine, Brownsville, Texas.\u000aWood County received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for the Dominican Republic Intervention of 1965.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of United States Navy LSTs\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aThis article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.

aVAnglo-America most often refers to a region in the Americas in which English is a main language and British culture and the British Empire have had significant historical, ethnic, linguistic and cultural impact. Anglo-America is distinct from Latin America, a region of the Americas where Romance languages (Spanish, Portuguese and French) are prevalent.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geographic region ==\u000a\u000aThe term Anglo-America frequently refers specifically to the United States and Canada, by far the two most populous English-speaking countries in North America. Other areas composing the Anglophone Caribbean include territories of the former British West Indies, Belize, Bermuda, and Guyana.\u000aTwo notable territories with substantial non-Anglophone majorities are nonetheless often included in Anglo-America for linguistical reasons. In Canada, the francophone province of Quebec, Acadia in New Brunswick and a part of Cochrane District are sometimes considered part of Anglo-America for cultural, economic, geographical, historical, and political reasons. Similarly, Spanish-speaking Puerto Rico is considered part of Anglo-America because of its status as an unincorporated territory of the United States. Conversely, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, and Saba are not typically included in Anglo-America, despite their English-speaking majorities, because they are constituent countries or public bodies that form part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Ethnic groups ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Economy ==\u000aPeople from other parts of the world have immigrated to Anglo-America to have a better quality of life, find better employment, and escape famine, poverty, violence and conflict.

aVThe FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup (also called the Basketball World Championship for Women or the FIBA Women's World Cup) is a world basketball tournament for women's national teams held quadrennially. Its inaugural game was in 1953 with the four-year cycle established in 1967. The next FIBA Women's World Cup will be held from 22 to 30 September 2018.\u000aFormerly known as the FIBA World Championship for Women, the name changed shortly after its 2014 edition. From 1986 through 2014, the tournament was held in the same year as the men's FIBA Basketball World Cup, though in different countries. After the 2014 editions of both championships, the men's event was rescheduled on a new four-year cycle (the next in September 2019) to avoid conflict with the men's FIFA World Cup. The Women's World Cup (September 2018) remains on the current four-year cycle, with editions held in the same years as the men's FIFA World Cup (June and July 2018). The next FIFA Women's World Cup is in June and July 2019.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe Women\u2019s World Cup was created by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). It began in 1953, held in Chile, three years after the first men's World Championship. For most of its early history, it was not held in the same year as the men's championship, and was not granted a consistent quadrennial cycle until 1967. After the 1983 event, FIBA changed the scheduling so that the women's tournament would be held in even-numbered non-Olympic years, a change that had come to the men's tournament in 1970.\u000aThe number of participating women's FIBA teams has remained at 16, unlike the men's event, which has been expanded to 24 and will expand further to 32 in 2019.\u000aOnly four nations have won titles in the history of the Women's World Cup. The United States has won the title nine times, including six of the last eight. The Soviet Union won six titles, including five in a row from 1959 to 1975. The only other countries to win have been Brazil in 1994 and Australia in 2006.\u000aThe 2014 World Championship for Women was the last tournament played in the same year as the men's, and also the last to be known as the "World Championship for Women". The Women's World Cup will remain on the current four-year cycle, with the final tournament played a few months after the men's FIFA World Cup. The men's FIBA World Cup will move to the year after the Women's World Cup. Accordingly, only the FIBA Women's World Cup will be held in 2018.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Results ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Summaries ===\u000a\u000aNote: From 1953 through 1979 the medalists were decided in a league format instead of in a knockout tournament; results of the final round matches are shown.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Medal table ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aFIBA Basketball World Cup (formerly FIBA World Championship)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aFIBA World Championship for Women 2010 Official Site\u000aUnited States history

aVHeck's Department Store, a chain of West Virginia based discount department stores, was founded by Boone County natives and businessmen Fred Haddad, Tom Ellis, and Lester Ellis and wholesale distributor Douglas Cook. The Heck's name was a combination of the names Haddad, Ellis and Cook. Haddad served as President, Lester Ellis was Vice-President, and Tom Ellis was Secretary-Treasurer.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aHeck's, Inc. was established in 1959 by Fred Haddad, Tom & Lester Ellis, and Doug Cook.\u000aHeck's stores were discount, stand alone department stores found in small cities throughout West Virginia, western Maryland, the Ohio Valley, and parts of Indiana & Kentucky. Its structure and product lines were similar to its competitors, Fisher's Big Wheel, Hills Department Stores, G.C. Murphy's Mart, Tempo and Buckeye Mart Stores and Walmart.\u000aPart of Heck's expansion into the Midwest came after acquiring a smaller discounter, T-Way Stores. It also acquired Mr. Wiggs of Indiana and Ohio in 1981.\u000aAt its peak in the 1980s, Heck's operated 170 stores throughout West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia. Forbes Magazine ranked Heck\u2019s third nationally in profitability and growth in 1980, beating out Kmart.\u000aIn 1983, Haddad retired as Heck's president and sold his stock in the company. The Ellis brothers had previously sold out in the 1970s.\u000aSales fell the following year, and the company saw its first losses in 1984. In 1985, layoffs began, as losses continued.\u000aA number of factors contributed to Heck\u2019s decline. The U.S. economic downturn of the early 1980s hit West Virginia particularly hard, and the store faced increased competition from other chains as well.\u000aIn February 1987 a $125 million merger agreement with New York City-Based Toussie-Viner Group was terminated due to weak performance by Heck's in the final months of 1986, and the company filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At the time of the filing, Heck's operated 140 stores.\u000aIn 1989 the company emerged from Chapter 11 with 55 stores and under a new name, as Take 10 Discount Club; a membership club costing $10 to join.\u000aIn September 1990 all of the assets of the Retail Division were sold to Retail Acquisition Corporation, Inc., and became L.A. Joe Department Stores. Two locations were sold to, and became, Fisher's Big Wheel. One Location was sold to Gabriel Brothers\u000aA 1991 Philadelphia Inquirer article lists several factors for the collapse of Heck\u2019s under the new management of Russell Isaacs, putting the blame on Isaacs sweeping changes to the stores: http://www.philly.com/philly/news/From_the_archive_How_death_came_to_a_once-prosperous_discount-store_chain.html\u000aSpecifically, the Inquirer cited customer frustration with constant store redesigns and products being dropped from inventory.

aVVivek Maru is an American social entrepreneur and human rights activist who is a pioneer in the field of global legal empowerment. He is currently the CEO of Namati: Innovations in Legal Empowerment, which he founded in 2011. Namati and its partners have built cadres of grassroots legal advocates \u2013 sometimes known as \u201ccommunity paralegals\u201d\u2013 in ten countries. The advocates have worked with over 65,000 people to protect community lands, enforce environmental law, and secure basic rights to healthcare and citizenship.\u000aIn a 2014 article, Maru complained that \u201cwhen world governments adopted development goals 15 years ago, law and justice were left out.\u201d As a result, while major progress has been made in the fields of health, education, and the reduction of poverty, access to law and justice has lagged behind. He asserted that all people should have the right to information about the laws and institutions they live under, the right to a legal identity, the right to have their property ownership respected, the right to participate in the shaping of laws and policies, and the right to a fair legal resolution of problems and conflicts.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life and education ==\u000aMaru's parents were immigrants from India; his grandfather was a Gandhian who ran a small printing press.\u000aMaru attended Harvard College from 1993\u201397, receiving an A.B. in Social Studies. He graduated magna cum laude, was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and was Class Marshal. His thesis was entitled "Mohandas, Martin, and Malcolm on Violence, Culture and Meaning."\u000aFrom August 1997 to August 1998, he was a Frederick Sheldon Fellow at the Harvard University Extension School in western India, where he worked with grassroots rural-development organizations, taught classes, trained teachers, designed a curriculum, and conducted research. He lived in \u201ca hut made of sticks and dung amid the poverty and pollution of India\u2019s Kutch region, from which his grandfather came.\u201d He \u201cworked with grassroots organizations on watershed management and education for girls.\u201d\u000aHe attended Yale Law School from 1998 to 2001, receiving a Doctor of Law (JD). According to the ABA Journal, Maru nearly quit law school \u201cbecause it wasn\u2019t presenting him with a Gandhian approach\u201d to legal work. At Yale he was co-founder and director of the Umoja Education Program and a fellow of the Schell Center for Human Rights. He was also a Founding Team Member of the Amistad Academy Charter School.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aFrom August 2001 to August 2002, Maru served as law clerk for Federal Appellate Judge Marsha Berzon of the Ninth Circuit of Appeals in the San Francisco Bay Area.\u000aBased in New York City, he was a Finberg Fellow at Human Rights Watch from September 2002 to September 2003.\u000aAfter Maru was invited by a friend, Simeon Koroma, to help Sierra Leone in the wake of its civil war, they co-founded Timap for Justice, which developed a nationwide network of paralegals at a time when there were only about 100 lawyers in the entire country, almost all of them in Freetown. \u201cParalegals working and living in the community can squeeze a lot of justice out of the system,\u201d Maru explained. Maru directed Timap from October 2003 to October 2007. During the same period he was also co-director of the Fourah Bay Human Rights Clinic in Freetown. In addition, he was a Sierra Leone-based consultant for the World Bank for four months in 2007.\u000aBased in Washington, D.C., he was senior counsel for the World Bank's Justice Reform Group from November 2007 to August 2011, and director of the World Bank Justice for the Poor Program in Sierra Leone. During this period he directed a program on community paralegals in Indonesia, Philippines, South Africa, Kenya, and Sierra Leone, and created a global \u201cGrassroots Justice Network\u201d to link these programs. He also developed the World Bank\u2019s first global strategy for justice reform.\u000aHe is now CEO of Namati: Innovations in Legal Empowerment, which he founded in August 2011. It is an international organization that seeks to build a movement of grassroots legal advocates. Namati has 186 paralegals in Kenya, Liberia, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar, who are part of a legal-empowerment network involving some 1,000 organizations. Matt Brown, a member of Namati\u2019s board, has said that \u201cVivek and Namati are creating a new field of legal empowerment." The organization has received support from the British and Australian governments, the United Nations Development Program, and other funders. He called the organization Namati, a Sanskrit word meaning to shape something into a curve, because of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s statement that the \u201carc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\u201d\u000aAshoka has distinguished Namati from other such efforts to provide community justice. While previous groups have worked alone and on a relatively small scale, have rarely documented the impact of their work, and haven't been in a position to learn lessons from the results of one another's work, Namati is a larger-scale activity that places emphasis on documenting its results and on enabling workers in the field to learn from one another about best practices. In 2014, Namati helped 700 Nubians in Kenya to acquire citizenship rights, resolves health-care problems in Sierra Leone and Mozambique, helped resolve violations of environmental law along the Indian coast, secured land-rights documentation for several thousand Burmese farmers, and helped dozens of communities in Liberia, Uganda, and Mozambique to win their land rights.\u000aNamati convenes the Global Legal Empowerment Network, more than 1,000 groups from 150 countries who are learning from one another and collaborating on common challenges. This community successfully advocated for the inclusion of access to justice in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Honors and awards ==\u000aAt Harvard, he won the Frederick Sheldon Fellowship, the Harvard Foundation Award for Advancing Intercultural and Race Relations, the Revival Undergraduate Prize, and the John Harvard Award for Academic Excellence.\u000aHe received the Pioneer Award from the North American South Asian Bar Association in 2008. In the same year he won the Professional Achievement Award from the Kutchi Jain Association of North America. In 2012 he won the Entrepreneur Award from the Connecticut Chapter of the Global Organization of People of Indian Origin.\u000aHe received the Ashoka Fellowship in 2014. In 2015, he was named an ABA 2015 Legal Rebel. In 2016, he, Namati, and the Global Legal Empowerment Netowrk received 2016 Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship.

aVAlbert von Keller (27 April 1844 \u2013 14 July 1920) was a German historical and genre painter.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aHe was born at Gais, in Switzerland; he studied at the Munich Academy under Lenbach and Ramberg, and must be counted among the leading colorists of the modern German school. Travels in Italy, France, England and the Netherlands, and a prolonged sojourn in Paris, helped to develop his style. He was awarded gold medals in Munich and Berlin, was made professor at and honorary member of the Munich Academy, and was decorated in 1898 with the Order of the Bavarian Crown, which conferred upon him nobility.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Work ==\u000aHis scenes of society life, such as the famous "Dinner" (1890), are painted with thoroughly Parisian esprit, and his portraits are marked by the same elegant distinction. He was particularly successful in the rendering of rustling silk and satin dresses and draperies. His historical and imaginative works were as modern in spirit and as unacademical as his portraits. As of 1911, at the Munich Pinakothek was his painting "Jairi Töchterlein" (Raising of Jairus's Daughter, 1886), while the Königsberg Museum contained his "Roman Bath", and the Liebieg collection in Reichenberg the "Audience with Louis XV", the first picture that drew attention to his talent, exhibited in Vienna in 1873. Among other important works he painted "Faustina in the Temple of Juno at Praeneste", "The Witches Sleep" (1888), "The Judgment of Paris", "The Happy Sister", "Temptation" (1892), "Autumn" (1893), "An Adventure" (1896), and "The Crucifixion".\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aAlbert von Schrenck-Notzing (1862\u20131929), German psychiatrist and parapsychologist with whom the artist was closely associated.

aVThe Demon's Lexicon is a 2009 novel by the Irish author Sarah Rees Brennan. It was published worldwide by Simon & Schuster on June 1, 2009. It is the first in The Demon trilogy, the others being The Demon's Covenant (2010) and The Demon's Surrender (2011).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot introduction ==\u000aThe story follows two brothers with a sordid past, Nick and Alan Ryves, who fight demons and monsters. They are on the run from a magician, from whom their mother supposedly stole an amulet, when they meet Mae and Jamie, troubled teenagers who come to them for help. Throughout the book they face horror, evil and people who just generally want to kill them, while long kept secrets are threatening to unravel. In the lore of the book, humans can either be born with magical powers, or can make pacts with demons who will grant them power or use their own magic. Very early on, Mae expresses the thought that she may have once had magical powers, but that they went away. Nick chastises her for this, saying that if you have magical powers, they never leave you.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Character List ==\u000aNick Ryves - Does not like anybody apart from his brother Alan, and cannot understand why Alan would endanger his life to help strangers.\u000aAlan Ryves - Nick's older brother, a redhead who wears glasses. He has a crippled leg, and is described as half Nick's size. While he is deadly with guns, he is also kind and always tries to help other people, notably Mae and Jamie.\u000aMae Crawford - Considered by Nick and Alan to be annoying and loud, she is the big sister of Jamie Crawford. She has pink hair.\u000aJamie Crawford - Mae's quiet brother. He is thin and nervous-looking, but kind. He makes jokes when he is nervous.\u000aOlivia - Nick and Alan's mother, Olivia is fond of Alan but hates Nick. She has mental problems and always wears charms, talismans and amulets.\u000aMerris Cromwell - The mysterious, unofficial leader of the Goblin Market. Very rich, she earns her money by running Mezentius House, a hospital/prison for bodies possessed by demons.\u000aSin - A dancer at the Goblin Market.\u000aBlack Arthur - A magician, leader of the Obsidian Circle. He is mean and power hungry, and would give up anything for power.\u000aGerald - A magician in the Obsidian Circle.\u000aAnzu - A demon, who usually takes the form of an eagle. His name is vagely similar to the classical demon's name, Pazuzu.\u000aLiannan - An icy demon, succubus, who thinks that Nick is her past lover. She is commonly known as "Yuki Onna" in Japan. The reason is never given.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Publication ==\u000aThe Demon's Lexicon was published worldwide on June 1, 2009. However, the book had an early Irish release, with Eason's stores selling the book as early as May 29.

aV"Son of man" is the translation of one Hebrew and one Aramaic phrase used in the Hebrew Bible. In Hebrew, the term is ben-adam, while in Aramaic its equivalent bar-adam is used. In post-biblical literature, the similar terms bar-anosh and bar-nasha also appear.\u000aThe Hebrew expression "son of man" (\u05d1\u05df\u2013\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd i.e. ben-'adam) appears one hundred and seven times in the Hebrew Bible. This is the most common Hebrew construction for the singular, appearing 93 times in the Book of Ezekiel alone and 14 times elsewhere. In thirty two cases, the phrase appears in intermediate plural form "sons of men".

For example:\u000aEzekiel 33:11-12\u000aEzekiel 2:1-10\u000a1 And He said to me; "Son of man (\u05d1\u05df\u05be\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd : [ben-'adam]), stand on your feet, and I shall speak with you."\u000a2 Now the spirit entered me when He spoke to me, and it stood me on my feet, and I heard what was being spoken to me.\u000a3 And He said to me; "Son of man (\u05d1\u05df\u05be\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd : [ben-'adam]), I am sending you to the children of Israel, to rebellious nations, which rebelled against Me; they and their fathers rebelled against Me to this very day.\u000a4 And the sons, who are brazen-faced and hard-hearted-I send you to them, and you shall say to them, 'So said the Lord God.'\u000a5 And they, whether they listen or whether they forbear-for they are a rebellious house-they shall know that a prophet was in their midst.\u000a6 And you, son of man (\u05d1\u05df\u05be\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd : [ben-'adam]), fear them not, and fear not their words, for they are obstinate and thorny with you, and you sit on eglantines; fear not their words, neither be dismayed by them, for they are a rebellious house.\u000a7 And you shall speak My words to them; whether they listen or they forbear, for they are rebellious.\u000a8 But you, son of man (\u05d1\u05df\u05be\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd : [ben-'adam]), hearken to what I speak to you; do not be rebellious like the rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you."\u000a9 And I saw, and behold, a hand stretched out to me, and behold, in it was a scroll of a book.\u000a10 And it spread it out before me, and it was inscribed before and behind, and there was written upon it lamentations and murmuring and woe.\u000aSon of man here appears to be a title referring to the humanity of the author, much how the word "human" may suffice in English. It is not a respectful appellation, but a humbling one (in some cases, an arguably abject one), and this use is a consistent pattern throughout Ezekiel.\u000aAll uses of son of man within Ezekiel are:\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Daniel ===\u000aIn the Book of Daniel, parts of the text are written in Aramaic, this portion of the volume (7:13-14) deals with a vision attributed to the author about "the times of the end":\u000aDaniel 7:13-14\u000a13 \u05d7\u05d6\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05d7\u05d6\u05d5\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d0\u05e8\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dd\u05be\u05e2\u05e0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05d9\u05d0 \u05db\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05c1 \u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e2\u05d3\u05be\u05e2\u05ea\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d9\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05d0 \u05de\u05d8\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e7\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e7\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05c3 14 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d1 \u05e9\u05c1\u05dc\u05d8\u05df \u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8 \u05d5\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d5 \u05d5\u05db\u05dc \u05e2\u05de\u05de\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05c1\u05e0\u05d9\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e4\u05dc\u05d7\u05d5\u05df \u05e9\u05c1\u05dc\u05d8\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e9\u05c1\u05dc\u05d8\u05df \u05e2\u05dc\u05dd \u05d3\u05d9\u05be\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e2\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d5\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d5\u05ea\u05d4 \u05e4\u000a13 I saw in the visions of the night, and behold with the clouds of the heaven, one like a man (\u05db\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d0\u05e0\u05e9 [kibar 'anash]) was coming, and he came up to the Ancient of Days and was brought before Him.\u000a14 And He gave him dominion and glory and a kingdom, and all peoples, nations, and tongues shall serve him; his dominion is an eternal dominion, which will not be removed, and his kingdom is one which will not be destroyed.\u000aDaniel 8:16-18\u000a16 \u05d5\u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05e2 \u05e7\u05d5\u05dc\u05be\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05d2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05d1\u05df \u05dc\u05d4\u05dc\u05d6 \u05d0\u05ea\u05be\u05d4\u05de\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4\u05c3 17 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d0\u05e6\u05dc \u05e2\u05de\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d1\u05d1\u05d0\u05d5 \u05e0\u05d1\u05e2\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d0\u05e4\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dc\u05be\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d1\u05df \u05d1\u05df\u05be\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u05db\u05d9 \u05dc\u05e2\u05ea\u05be\u05e7\u05e5 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d6\u05d5\u05df\u05c3 18 \u05d5\u05d1\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5 \u05e2\u05de\u05d9 \u05e0\u05e8\u05d3\u05de\u05ea\u05d9 \u05e2\u05dc\u05be\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e8\u05e6\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d2\u05e2\u05be\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e2\u05dc\u05be\u05e2\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05c3\u000a16And I heard the voice of a man (\u05e7\u05d5\u05dc\u2013\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd) in the midst of the Ulai, and he called and said, "Gabriel, enable this one to understand the vision."\u000a17And he came beside the palace where I was standing, and when he came, I became frightened, and I fell upon my face. Then he said to me, "Understand, son of man (\u05d1\u05df\u2013\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd), that the vision refers to the time of the end."\u000a18Now, when he spoke to me, I fell into a sound sleep upon my face to the ground, and he touched me and stood me up where I had been standing.\u000aWithin the context of Daniel passages, the use of son of man is explained by Rashi to denote: "one like a man was coming" - that is the human Jewish King Messiah, not Jesus, the divine Christian Messiah godhead. It has been argued that "there came with the clouds of the sky 'one like a son of man'" describes one "like a human being". The passage in Daniel 7:13 occurs in Biblical Aramaic and it certainly implicates a "human being". Many (Christian) interpretations tried to read a messianic allusion into this verse, "but in all probability the reference is to an angel with a human appearance, perhaps Michael."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Post-biblical literature ==\u000aThe most common post-biblical use is similar to that of the English word "human". For example:\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Story of Haninah ben Dosa ===\u000aSimilarly, there are two stories of how Haninah ben Dosa was bitten by a lizard while praying ("Babylonian Gemara" and "Jerusalem Talmud"):\u000aY.

Once, while thus engaged, a lizard bit him, but he did not interrupt his prayers. To his disciples' anxious inquiries he answered that he had been so preoccupied in prayer as not even to feel the bite. When the people found the reptile, dead, they exclaimed, "Woe to the man whom a lizard bites, and woe to the lizard that bites R. \u1e24anina b. Dosa!" His wonderful escape is accounted for by the assertion that the result of a lizard's bite depends upon which reaches water first, the man or the lizard; if the former, the latter dies; if the latter, the former dies. In \u1e24anina's case a spring miraculously opened under his very feet (Yer. Ber. v. 9a). The Babylonian Gemara (Ber. 33a) has a different version of this miracle."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Apocryphal literature ==\u000aThe most common apocryphal use is also similar to that of the English word "human".

[The text is Aramaic.]\u000aIn the Hebrew of Genesis 13:16, the word translated as \u05d1\u05e8 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d5\u05e9 (son of man) was \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 (man).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Interpretation ==\u000aAs generally interpreted by Jews, "son of man" denotes mankind generally in contrast to deity or godhead, with special reference to the human weakness and frailty (Job 25:6; Psalms 8:4; Psalms 144:3; Psalms 146:3; Isaiah 51:12, etc.).\u000aThe term "ben adam" is but a formal substitute for the personal pronoun or maybe a title given to the prophet Ezekiel, probably to remind him of his human weakness.\u000aSon of man in Job 25 and Psalm 146 is ben adam (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05df\u05be\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd\u200e), and "son of man" in Psalms 144 is ben enosh (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05df\u05be\u05d0\u05e0\u05d5\u05e9\u200e).\u000a"Among Jews the term "son of man" was not used as the specific title of the Messiah. The New Testament expression \u1f45 \u1f51\u03b9\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 is a translation of the Aramaic "bar nasha," and as such could have been understood only as the substitute for a personal pronoun, or as emphasizing the human qualities of those to whom it is applied. That the term does not appear in any of the epistles ascribed to Paul is significant. In the [Christian] Gospels the title occurs eighty-one times. Most (..) have come to the conclusion that Jesus, speaking Aramaic, could never have designated himself as the "son of man" in a Messianic, mystic sense, because the Aramaic term never implied this meaning."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000aBerger, David; Wyschogrod, Michael (1978).

He lives in a house full of y\u014dkai along with his y\u014dkai grandfather. Trying to escape his fate, he does good deeds in order to avoid becoming a y\u014dkai, despite his grandfather's wish that Rikuo succeed him as the Third Head of the Nura Clan. Rikuo is different because he helps humans. He eventually comes to terms with his y\u014dkai blood and decides to take up the position of the Third Head of the Nura Clan. Multiple factions aim to stop him or usurp his position, and he must gather friends and allies, a new Hyakki Yak\u014d under his banner of "Fear".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Storyline ===\u000aGyuki's Test Arc\u000aThe Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol travels to Mt. Nejireme at the invitation of a supposed y\u014dkai specialist. However, the invitation turns out to have been a trap by the head of the Gyuki Clan. Separated, the members of the Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol must deal with y\u014dkai of the Gyuki Clan and Rikuo ultimately faces Gyuki himself. Rikuo learns that Gyuki set up the trap because he didn't want the Nura Clan, which he greatly cherishes, to suffer under the influence of a weak leader.The two clash and Gyuki is overwhelmed by Rikuo's night form. Afterward, Rikuo decides to take up the mantle of Nurarihyon and officially become the next Nura Clan head.\u000aShikoku Arc\u000aWhen one of the board members of the Nura Clan is attacked and killed, and Nurarihyon subsequently disappears without notice, the Nura Clan is thrown into chaos. Trying to keep them together, Rikuo encounters a rival faction from the Shikoku area who intend to take over the Nura Clan's territory. Their leader, Tamazuki, is ruthless and willing to sacrifice his subordinates to further his own goals. Rikuo and his Hyakki Yak\u014d battle with Tamazuki and his Hachijuuhakki Yak\u014d (consisting of 88 demons, instead of the 100 of a Hyakki Yak\u014d) and emerge victorious.However, Rikuo decides to spare Tamazuki after the battle at the request of his father - who Nurarihyon had gone to visit. Tamazuki is spared under the condition that he build a memorial in honor of the subordinates who died by his hand.\u000aPast Arc\u000aThe story of Rikuo's grandparents Nurarihyon and Yohime, the creation of the spirit blade Nenekirimaru and the battle against Hagoromo Gitsune 400 years ago.\u000aTono Arc\u000aWhen Haguromo Gitsune resurfaces in Kyoto, Rikuo is determined to fight her and take revenge for his father's death - as well as rescue Yura, who has gone to aid the rest of the Keikain family in protecting Kyoto. However, as he is still too inexperienced and weak, his grandfather asks the head of the y\u014dkai Tono Village to take in and train Rikuo. After an encounter with one of the Kyoto Yokai, Rikuo comes to realize what sort of power the y\u014dkai Nurarihyon possesses and, having grown stronger, leaves along with several Tono Yokai to return to the Nura House and prepare for the assault on Kyoto.\u000aKyoto Arc\u000aRikuo, along with the vast majority of the Nura Clan and several y\u014dkai from Tono, invade Kyoto. Nearly all of the onmyoji barriers around the city have been destroyed by Kyoto Yokai, and the Keikain House itself struggles to fight against Hagoromo Gitsune's forces. They ultimately join forces with Rikuo's Hyakki Yak\u014d to replace the fallen barriers and stop Hagoromo Gitsune from giving birth to a new evil.\u000aHundred Tales Clan Arc\u000aAfter the battle with Hagoromo Gitsune's forces and the resurrected Abe no Seimei, also known as Nue, Rikuo and the Nura Clan are challenged by the remnants of the Hundred Tales Clan and its executives. The clan was once led by a human named Sanmoto Gorozaemon who grew in power by spreading stories about y\u014dkai and in turn created them. The group was destroyed by Rihan and the Nura Clan 350 years ago. Now, the clan is encroaching on the Nura Clan's territory and working to revive Sanmoto's main body, which resides in hell.\u000aGokadoin House Arc\u000aFollowing the battle with Sanmoto Gorozaemon and his Hundred Tales Clan, it was revealed that the onmyoji sect known as the Gokadoin House is composed of Abe no Seimei's descendants who used Seimei's forbidden research on immortality to prolong their lives. When the Gokadoin house starts mobilizing to "purify" the land of y\u014dkai and humans, Rikuo starts to establish an alliance between the various yokai clans throughout Japan.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Media ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Manga ===\u000a\u000aNura: Rise of the Yokai Clan is written and illustrated by Hiroshi Shiibashi and has been serialized in the manga anthology Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump since March 2008.

aVMarcus Hook is a borough in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,397 at the 2010 census. The current mayor is Gene Taylor. The borough calls itself "The Cornerstone of Pennsylvania". The 2005 film One Last Thing... was set and partially filmed in Marcus Hook.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe earliest inhabitants of Marcus Hook were the Lenape Indians. The Lenape had a major settlement in Marcus Hook which became a New Sweden trading post in the 1640s. Called "Chammassungh" or "Finland", it was on the west side of the Delaware River, between Marcus Hook Creek and Naamans Creek. The settlement was renamed "Marrites Hoeck" after the Dutch conquered the area in 1655. The name is derived from the word Hook, meaning promontory, or point of land projecting into the water and Marcus, a corruption of the name of the Indian chief, Maarte who lived at the Hook.\u000aSt. Martin's Church was founded in 1699 and opened for worship in 1702. It was founded by Walter Martin of Upper Chichester as an alternative place of worship and burial for non-Quakers.\u000aMarcus Hook became a prosperous community and market town and in 1708 was of equal prominence to nearby Chester, Pennsylvania, with each location having approximately 100 houses.\u000aIn the early 1700's, Marcus Hook was a haven for pirates that plagued the lower Delaware River. The market at Marcus Hook provided the pirates a place to sell plundered goods and re-supply away from the authorities and custom officials in Philadelphia. Early maps of Marcus Hook show the current Second Street was originally named "Discord Lane", named so since it was the location of the pirates' revelry when they were in town.\u000aThere is a local oral tradition that the Marcus Hook Plank House was once the home of the mistress of the pirate Blackbeard.\u000aBy the mid-1700's, Marcus Hook became a major regional center for the building of wooden sailing ships and remained so until the late 19th century when larger tonnage ships became more popular than the sloops and schooners built in Marcus Hook.\u000aDuring the American Revolutionary War, two tiers of cheveaux-de-fris were placed across the Delaware River at Marcus Hook to provide a first line of defense of Philadelphia against the British naval forces. Marcus Hook also served as a training center for the Pennsylvania militia. The Continental Army was stationed at Marcus Hook during the fall of 1777. The town was bombarded by British warships more than once and may be the reason why there are very few pre-Revolutionary houses in Marcus Hook.\u000aMarcus Hook served as a defensive post along the Delaware River during the War of 1812 with over 5,000 troops placed there.\u000aLater, Marcus Hook became a resort and amusement center.\u000aThe borough was officially incorporated on March 7, 1892. The convergence of rail, roads, a deepwater port, and the nation's growing thirst for petroleum gave rise to the refineries that became the borough's dominant industry.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geography ==\u000aMarcus Hook is located along the southern border of Delaware County (and Pennsylvania) at 39°49\u2032N 75°25\u2032W (39.8182, -75.4155).

aVCross Ranch Headquarters is a historic ranch located east of Montana Highway 59 roughly 26 miles (42 km) south of Broadus, Montana, USA. Rancher Spencer Fullerton Baird Biddle built the headquarters in 1893, one year after purchasing the ranch. A Philadelphia native, Biddle moved to Montana in 1881; he quickly became a prominent rancher, and by 1885 he was both an early member of the Montana Stockgrowers Association and a representative in Montana's territorial legislature. At the time, ranchers were a powerful influence on state government, and Biddle's legislature passed several laws supported by the ranching industry.\u000aBiddle's ranch headquarters has a French Colonial design, an unusual example of a high architectural style in a ranch building. The building features a porch encircling all four sides and supported by wooden columns, piece sur piece walls, and a hip roof.\u000aThe ranch was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1996.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVAnnie Lewis (c. 1869 \u2013 1896) was an American soubrette of light operas and musical comedies whose life was cut short while still in her twenties, a victim of tuberculosis.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aAnnie B. Lewis was born and raised in Washington D. C. where her father, Charles Lewis, clerked for the U. S. Treasury Department. Early on Lewis demonstrated a talent for mimicry and by age four she was performing on stage under the eye of her mother, Amelia Lewis, a former parlor entertainer. At that age her song-and-dance routine oftentimes would be performed atop a piano to enable her to be seen by the audience.\u000aBy sixteen Lewis was touring the country with her own company as the soubrette in Lincoln A. Fisher\u2019s Little Trump, and the following year with Charles Verner in Shamus O\u2019Brien, a romantic comedy from the poem by Frederick Maeder and Thomas B. Macdonough. Lewis would go on to play leading roles in productions of Favette, a comedietta in one act, adapted for the stage by John Treshar from the story by Ouida; Our Irish Visitor; David Loyd's The Woman-Hater; Gus Heege productions of A Lumber Camp in Winter and Yon Yonson; the comic opera Prince Pro Tem by Robert A. Barnet and Lewis S. Thompson, first performed at the Boston Museum on September 17, 1894; Frederick Hallen and Joseph Hart's vaudeville skit Later On; and A Nutmeg March by William Hawthorn.\u000a\u000aIn May 1895 she supported Camille D'Arville at the Broadway Theatre in A Daughter of the Revolution, a historical comic opera by J. Cheever Goodwin and Ludwig Engländer. A short time later ill health would force her to withdraw from performing.\u000aLewis married William Lackey on December 22, 1886, in Essex, Ontario, Canada. Lackey was known on the stage as Wilton Lackaye and would go on to have a long career in theater and film. At the time she was 17 and he 25.\u000aShe died in October 1896 at her parents' Washington home, nearly a year after what was thought to have been a bad cold had developed into tuberculosis. Lewis spent some time in the months that followed in the American Southwest in a desperate hope that the dry weather there would help improve her health. A successful benefit concert organized by her brother-in-law in the summer of 1896 in Washington D. C. raised needed funds for her care. Just two years earlier it had been reported in the press that Lewis had purchased in cash a $9,000 granite-and-brick house for her parents in the exclusive Chevy Chase, neighborhood of Washington D. C.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sources ==

aVSpring Street Park, is a small triangular park in lower Manhattan in New York City. The park is bounded by Spring Street on the north, Broome Street on the south, Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) on the east, and on the west by a narrow two-block street considered to be a spur of Sixth Avenue. As a pedestrian plaza, the triangle was known as SoHo Square. The neighborhood in which the park is located is Hudson Square, although it is also sometimes referred to as "West SoHo".\u000aSoHo Square was created when Sixth Avenue was extended south of Carmine Street, one of several similar squares to come into existence in that way. In keeping with the renaming of the avenue as the "Avenue of the Americas" in 1945, it contains a larger-than-lifesize statue of General José Artigas, a Uruguayan independence leader and national hero; this is a second cast from a statue by Uruguayan sculptor José Luis Zorrilla de San Martín, the first of which stands in front of the Uruguayan National Bank in Montevideo, where it has been since 1949.\u000aThe land is owned by the New York City Department of Transportation, while the park, which has been undergoing a complete overhaul since April 2017, will, when completed, be maintained by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and the Hudson Square Connection business improvement district (BID). The redesign and renovation was funded by $3 million from the BID, $2 million from the New York City Economic Development Corporation and $1 million from the New York City Council, and will provide 160 places to sit, including "swivel seats", customized energy-efficient lighting, and 42 new trees plus other plantings. In addition, the statue of General Artigas will be moved to a more prominent placement. The aim of the redesign is to create "a world-class green space that residents, employees and visitors will enjoy for generations," according to a City Council member. The redesign of the plaza into a park is the centerpieces of the BID's streetscape improvement planfor the Hudson Square neighborhood.\u000aThe Dahesh Museum of Art, the Chelsea Career & Technical Education High School, the NYC iSchool, and the Here performance venue are all located around the plaza.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Alas de Oros (Spanish for "Wings of Gold") is an annual professional wrestling tournament held by the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA). The tournament features young high-fliers, hence the "Wings of Gold" moniker, who are either low-card or mid-card workers at the time of the tournament. The "Alas de Oro" title is not defended outside the tournament like AAA's Reina de Reinas title is. The tournament was created in 2007 and saw Extreme Tiger win the first Alas de Oro, in 2008 Aero Star won the tournament.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Alas de Oro 2007 ==\u000aThe first Alas de Oro tournament featured an eight-man elimination match where two wrestlers were in the ring at the same time while the remaining competitors stayed on the floor. If a wrestler was eliminated or left the ring a wrestler from the outside could enter the ring to continue the match. The tournament took place on July 27, 2007 and included Real Fuerza Aérea (Laredo Kid, Pegasso, Rey Cometa, Aero Star and Super Fly), Hombre sin Miedo, Extreme Tiger and Escoria. Escoria was the sole Rudo (Heel or bad guy) in the match. Extreme Tiger won the match eliminating Super Fly as the last competitor. Extreme Tiger was the competitor with the most eliminations, three (Super Fly, Hombre Sin Miedo and Laredo Kid).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Alas de Oro 2008 ==\u000aThe 2008 version of Alas de Oro was held on August 8, 2008 and this year included nine wrestlers in the same elimination match format that was used for the 2007 event. There were four wrestlers from the 2007 match that also participated in the 2008 version, including the previous winner Extreme Tiger as well as Aero Star, Escoria and Super Fly. In the 2008 event there was a more balanced Tecnico/Rudo mix than in 2007 as Rudos Jack Evans and Teddy Hart competed alongside Último Gladiador, El Ángel and Gato Eveready. Extreme Tigre was eliminated second to last, just before Aero Star pinned Jack Evans to win the match. During the pinfall Jack Evans kicked out for a controversial finish.

aVRadiation-absorbent material, usually known as RAM, is a material which has been specially designed and shaped to absorb incident RF radiation (also known as non-ionising radiation), as effectively as possible, from as many incident directions as possible. The more effective the RAM, the lower the resulting level of reflected RF radiation. Many measurements in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and antenna radiation patterns require that spurious signals arising from the test setup, including reflections, are negligible to avoid the risk of causing measurement errors and ambiguities.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Introduction ==\u000a\u000aOne of the most effective types of RAM comprises arrays of pyramid shaped pieces, each of which is constructed from a suitably lossy material. To work effectively, all internal surfaces of the anechoic chamber must be entirely covered with RAM. Sections of RAM may be temporarily removed to install equipment but they must be replaced before performing any tests. To be sufficiently lossy, RAM can be neither a good electrical conductor nor a good electrical insulator as neither type actually absorbs any power. Typically pyramidal RAM will comprise a rubberized foam material impregnated with controlled mixtures of carbon and iron. The length from base to tip of the pyramid structure is chosen based on the lowest expected frequency and the amount of absorption required. For low frequency damping, this distance is often 24 inches, while high-frequency panels are as short as 3\u20134 inches. Panels of RAM are typically installed on the walls of an EMC test chamber with the tips pointing inward to the chamber. Pyramidal RAM attenuates signal by two effects: scattering and absorption. Scattering can occur both coherently, when reflected waves are in-phase but directed away from the receiver, or incoherently where waves are picked up by the receiver but are out of phase and thus have lower signal strength. This incoherent scattering also occurs within the foam structure, with the suspended carbon particles promoting destructive interference. Internal scattering can result in as much as 10 dB of attenuation. Meanwhile, the pyramid shapes are cut at angles that maximize the number of bounces a wave makes within the structure. With each bounce, the wave loses energy to the foam material and thus exits with lower signal strength. An alternative type of RAM comprises flat plates of ferrite material, in the form of flat tiles fixed to all interior surfaces of the chamber. This type has a smaller effective frequency range than the pyramidal RAM and is designed to be fixed to good conductive surfaces. It is generally easier to fit and more durable than the pyramidal type RAM but is less effective at higher frequencies. Its performance might however be quite adequate if tests are limited to lower frequencies (ferrite plates have a damping curve that makes them most effective between 30\u20131000 MHz). There is also a hybrid type, a ferrite in pyramidal shape. Containing the advantages of both technologies, the frequency range can be maximized while the pyramid remains small (10 cm).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Use in stealth technology ==\u000aRadar-absorbent RAM is used in stealth technology to disguise a vehicle or structure from radar detection. A material's absorbency at a given frequency of radar wave depends upon its composition. RAM cannot perfectly absorb radar at any frequency, but any given composition does have greater absorbency at some frequencies than others; no one RAM is suited to absorption of all radar frequencies. A common misunderstanding is that RAM makes an object invisible to radar. A radar-absorbent material can significantly reduce an object's radar cross-section in specific radar frequencies, but it does not result in "invisibility" on any frequency. Bad weather may contribute to deficiencies in stealth capability.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== History ===\u000aThe earliest forms of stealth coating were the materials called Sumpf and Schornsteinfeger, a coating used by the German navy during World War II for the snorkels (or periscopes) of submarines, to lower their reflectivity in the 20-cm radar band the Allies used. The material had a layered structure and was based on graphite particles and other semiconductive materials embedded in a rubber matrix. The material's efficiency was partially reduced by the action of sea water.\u000aA related use was planned for the Horten Ho 229 aircraft. The adhesive which bonded plywood sheets in its skin was impregnated with graphite particles which were intended to reduce its visibility to Britain's radar.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Types of radar-absorbent material (RAM) ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Iron ball paint absorber ====\u000a\u000aOne of the most commonly known types of RAM is iron ball paint. It contains tiny spheres coated with carbonyl iron or ferrite. Radar waves induce molecular oscillations from the alternating magnetic field in this paint, which leads to conversion of the radar energy into heat. The heat is then transferred to the aircraft and dissipated. The iron particles in the paint are obtained by decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl and may contain traces of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. One technique used in the F-117A Nighthawk and other such stealth aircraft is to use electrically isolated carbonyl iron balls of specific dimensions suspended in a two-part epoxy paint. Each of these microscopic spheres is coated in quartz (silicon dioxide) as an insulator through a proprietary process. Then, during the fabrication panel process, while the paint is still liquid, a magnetic field is applied with a specific Gauss strength and at a specific distance to create a magnetic field patterns in the carbonyl iron balls within the liquid paint ferrofluid. The paint then cures [hardens] whilst the magnetic field holds the particles in suspension, locking the balls into their magnetic pattern. Some experimentation has been done applying opposing north-south magnetic fields to opposing sides of the painted panels causing the carbonyl iron particles to align (standing up on end so they are three-dimensionally parallel to the magnetic field). The carbonyl iron ball paint is most effective when the balls are evenly dispersed, electrically isolated, and present a gradient of progressively greater density to the incoming radar waves. A related type of RAM consists of neoprene polymer sheets with ferrite grains or conductive carbon black particles (containing about 0.30% of crystalline graphite by cured weight) embedded in the polymer matrix. The tiles were used on early versions of the F-117A Nighthawk, although more recent models use painted RAM. The painting of the F-117 is done by industrial robots so the paint can be applied consistently in specific layer thicknesses and densities. The plane is covered in tiles "glued" to the fuselage and the remaining gaps are filled with iron ball "glue." The United States Air Force introduced a radar-absorbent paint made from both ferrofluidic and nonmagnetic substances. By reducing the reflection of electromagnetic waves, this material helps to reduce the visibility of RAM-painted aircraft on radar. The Israeli firm Nanoflight has also made a radar-absorbing paint that uses nanoparticles. The Republic of China (Taiwan)'s military has also successfully developed radar-absorbing paint which is currently used on Taiwanese stealth warships and the Taiwanese-built stealth jet fighter which is currently in development in response to the development of stealth technology by their rival, the mainland People's Republic of China which is known to have displayed both stealth warships and planes to the public.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Foam absorber ====\u000aFoam absorber is used as lining of anechoic chambers for electromagnetic radiation measurements. This material typically consists of a fireproofed urethane foam loaded with conductive carbon black [carbonyl iron spherical particles, and/or crystalline graphite particles] in mixtures between 0.05% and 0.1% (by weight in finished product), and cut into square pyramids with dimensions set specific to the wavelengths of interest. Further improvements can be made when the conductive particulates are layered in a density gradient, so the tip of the pyramid has the lowest percentage of particles and the base contains the highest density of particles. This presents a "soft" impedance change to incoming radar waves and further reduces reflection (echo). The length from base to tip, and width of the base of the pyramid structure is chosen based on the lowest expected frequency when a wide-band absorber is sought. For low-frequency damping in military applications, this distance is often 24 in, while high-frequency panels are as short as 3-4 in. An example of a high-frequency application would be the police radar (speed-measuring radar K and Ka band), the pyramids would have a dimension around 4 in long and a 2 x 2-in base. That pyramid would set on a 2 x 2-in cubical base that is 1in high (total height of pyramid and base of about 5 in). The four edges of the pyramid are softly sweeping arcs giving the pyramid a slightly "bloated" look. This arc provides some additional scatter and prevents any sharp edge from creating a coherent reflection. Panels of RAM are installed with the tips of the pyramids pointing toward the radar source. These pyramids may also be hidden behind an outer nearly radar-transparent shell where aerodynamics are required. Pyramidal RAM attenuates signal by scattering and absorption. Scattering can occur both coherently, when reflected waves are in-phase but directed away from the receiver, or incoherently where waves may be reflected back to the receiver but are out of phase and thus have lower signal strength. A good example of coherent reflection is in the faceted shape of the F-117A stealth aircraft which presents angles to the radar source such that coherent waves are reflected away from the point of origin (usually the detection source). Incoherent scattering also occurs within the foam structure, with the suspended conductive particles promoting destructive interference. Internal scattering can result in as much as 10 dB of attenuation. Meanwhile, the pyramid shapes are cut at angles that maximize the number of bounces a wave makes within the structure. With each bounce, the wave loses energy to the foam material and thus exits with lower signal strength. Other foam absorbers are available in flat sheets, using an increasing gradient of carbon loadings in different layers. Absorption within the foam material occurs when radar energy is converted to heat in the conductive particle. Therefore, in applications where high radar energies are involved, cooling fans are used to exhaust the heat generated.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Jaumann absorber ====\u000aA Jaumann absorber or Jaumann layer is a radar-absorbent substance. When first introduced in 1943, the Jaumann layer consisted of two equally spaced reflective surfaces and a conductive ground plane. One can think of it as a generalized, multilayered Salisbury screen, as the principles are similar. Being a resonant absorber (i.e. it uses wave interfering to cancel the reflected wave), the Jaumann layer is dependent upon the \u03bb/4 spacing between the first reflective surface and the ground plane and between the two reflective surfaces (a total of \u03bb/4 + \u03bb/4 ). Because the wave can resonate at two frequencies, the Jaumann layer produces two absorption maxima across a band of wavelengths (if using the two layers configuration). These absorbers must have all of the layers parallel to each other and the ground plane that they conceal. More elaborate Jaumann absorbers use series of dielectric surfaces that separate conductive sheets. The conductivity of those sheets increases with proximity to the ground plane.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Split-ring resonator absorber ====\u000a\u000aSplit-ring resonators (SRRs) in various test configurations have been shown to be extremely effective as radar absorbers. SRR technology can be used in conjunction with the technologies above to provide a cumulative absorption effect. SRR technology is particularly effective when used on faceted shapes that have perfectly flat surfaces that present no direct reflections back to the radar source (such as the F-117A). This technology uses photographic process to create a resist layer on a thin (about 0.007 in) copper foil on a dielectric backing (thin circuit board material) etched into tuned resonator arrays, each individual resonator being in a "C" shape (or other shape\u2014such as a square). Each SRR is electrically isolated and all dimensions are carefully specified to optimize absorption at a specific radar wavelength. Not being a closed loop "O", the opening in the "C" presents a gap of specific dimension which acts as a capacitor. At 35 GHz, the diameter of the "C" is near 5 mm. The resonator can be tuned to specific wavelengths and multiple SRRs can be stacked with insulating layers of specific thicknesses between them to provide a wide-band absorption of radar energy. When stacked, the smaller SRRs (high-frequency) in the range face the radar source first (like a stack of donuts that get progressively larger as one moves away from the radar source) stacks of three have been shown to be effective in providing wide-band attenuation. SRR technology acts very much in the same way that antireflective coatings operate at optical wavelengths. SRR technology provides the most effective radar attenuation of any technologies known previously and is one step closer to reaching complete invisibility (total stealth, "cloaking"). Work is also progressing in visual wavelengths, as well as infrared wavelengths (LIDAR-absorbing materials).\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Carbon nanotube ====\u000a\u000aRadars work in the microwave frequency range, which can be absorbed by multi-wall nanotubes (MWNTs). Applying the MWNTs to the aircraft would cause the radar to be absorbed and therefore seem to have a smaller radar cross-section. One such application could be to paint the nanotubes onto the plane. Recently there has been some work done at the University of Michigan regarding carbon nanotubes usefulness as stealth technology on aircraft. It has been found that in addition to the radar absorbing properties, the nanotubes neither reflect nor scatter visible light, making it essentially invisible at night, much like painting current stealth aircraft black except much more effective. Current limitations in manufacturing, however, mean that current production of nanotube-coated aircraft is not possible. One theory to overcome these current limitations is to cover small particles with the nanotubes and suspend the nanotube-covered particles in a medium such as paint, which can then be applied to a surface, like a stealth aircraft.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aLidar\u000aRadar cross-section (RCS)\u000aStealth technology\u000aFerrofluid#Defense\u000aRadar jamming and deception\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Notes ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Bibliography ===\u000aThe Schornsteinfeger Project, CIOS Report XXVI-24.\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aSuppliers of Radar absorbent materials

aVCrypto-Judaism is the secret adherence to Judaism while publicly professing to be of another faith; practitioners are referred to as "crypto-Jews" (origin from Greek kryptos \u2013 \u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, 'hidden').\u000aThe term is especially applied historically to Spanish Jews who\u2014outwardly\u2014professed Catholicism, who were also known as Anusim or Marranos. The phenomenon is especially associated with renaissance Spain, following the June 6, 1391, Anti-Jewish pogroms and the expulsion of the Jews in 1492.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Europe ==\u000aOfficially, Jews who converted in Spain in the 14th and 15th centuries were known as Cristianos Nuevos (New Christians), but were commonly called conversos. Spain and Portugal passed legislation restricting their rights in the mother countries and colonies; only Christians were allowed to go to the New World. Despite the dangers of the Inquisition, many conversos continued to secretly and discreetly practice Jewish rituals.\u000aAfter the Alhambra decree of 1492 numerous conversos, also called Xueta (or Chueta) in the Balearic Islands ruled by Spain, publicly professed Roman Catholicism but privately adhered to Judaism, even through the Spanish Inquisition. They are among the most widely known and documented crypto-Jews.\u000aCrypto-Judaism existed also in earlier periods, whenever Jews were forced or pressured to convert to the majority religion by the rulers of places where they resided. Some of the Jewish followers of Sabbatai Zevi (Sabbateans) formally converted to Islam. Later followers of Jacob Frank ("Frankists") formally converted to Christianity, but maintained aspects of practice of their versions of Messianic Judaism.\u000aCrypto-Jews persisted in Russia and Eastern European countries influenced by the Soviet Union after the rise of Communism with the Russian Revolution of 1917. The government, which included secular Communist Jews, did not force Jews to convert to the Russian Orthodox Church, but regarded practice of any religion as undesirable. Some faiths were allowed to continue under strict supervision by the regime. Since the end of Communism, many people in former Soviet states, including descendants of Jews, have publicly taken up the faith of their ancestors again.\u000aThe "Belmonte Jews" of Portugal, dating from the 12th century, maintained strong secret traditions for centuries. A whole community survived in secrecy by maintaining a tradition of endogamous marriage and hiding all external signs of their faith. They and their practices were discovered only in the 20th century. Their rich Sephardic tradition of Crypto-Judaism is unique. Some now profess Orthodox Judaism, although many still retain their centuries-old traditions.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Role of Maimonides ===\u000aAs one of the towering figures in Judaism and the publisher of the Mishneh Torah expansion of the Talmud, Maimonides also issued a landmark doctrinal response to the forced conversions of Jews in the Iberian peninsula by the Almohads:\u000a\u000aIn his Epistle on Martyrdom, however, Maimonides suggested that the persecuted Jew should publicly adopt Islam while maintaining crypto-Judaism and not seek martyrdom unless forced to transgress Jewish commandments in public. He also excoriated one writer who advocated martyrdom for "long-winded foolish babbling and nonsense" and for misleading and hurting the Jews. In a sweeping view of the Jewish past, Maimonides marshals examples of heretics and sinners from the Bible to show that even oppressors of Israel were rewarded by God for a single act of piety or respect. How much greater then, he argues, will be the reward of the Jews "who despite the exigencies of forced conversion perform commandments secretly."\u000a\u000aMaimonides championed rationalism over the then-accepted practice of martyrdom when facing religious adversity. This consequently legitimized crypto-Judaism by the religion's standards, and provided doctrinal backing for Jews during the centuries of the Spanish Inquisition (1478\u20131834).\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Before the Spanish Inquisition ===\u000aAccording to the Jewish Virtual Library, several incidents of forced conversions happened prior to 1492 and outside of Iberia. One of the earliest conversions happened a century after the Fall of Rome and was in Clermont-Ferrand. After a member of the Jewish community in Clermont-Ferrand became a Jewish Christian and was persecuted by other members of the community for doing so, the cavalcade in which he was marching persecuted his persecutors in turn:\u000a\u000aThe participants in the procession then made an attack "which destroyed [the synagogue] completely, razing it to the grounds." Subsequently, Bishop *Avitus directed a letter to the Jews in which he disclaimed the use of compulsion to make them adopt Christianity, but announced at the end of the missive: "Therefore if ye be ready to believe as I do, be one flock with us, and I shall be your pastor; but if ye be not ready, depart from this place." The community hesitated for three days before making a decision. Finally the majority, some 500, accepted Christianity. The Christians in Clermont greeted the event with rejoicing: "Candles were lit, the lamps shone, the whole city radiated with the light of the snow-white flock" (i.e., the forced converts). The Jews who preferred exile left for *Marseilles (Gregory of Tours, Histories, 5:11). The poet Venantius Fortunatus composed a poem to commemorate the occasion. In 582 the Frankish king Chilperic compelled numerous Jews to adopt Christianity. Again the anusim were not wholehearted in their conversion, for "some of them, cleansed in body but not in heart, denied God, and returned to their ancient perfidy, so that they were seen keeping the Sabbath, as well as Sunday" (ibid., 6:17).\u000a\u000aThe Clermont-Ferrand conversions preceded the first forced conversions in Iberia by 40 years. Forced baptisms of Jews took place in Iberia in 616 at the insistence of Visigoth monarch Sisibut:\u000a\u000aPersistent attempts to enforce conversion were made in the seventh century by the Visigoths in Spain after they had adopted the Roman Catholic faith. Comparatively mild legal measures were followed by the harsh edict issued by King Sisibut in 616, ordering the compulsory baptism of all Jews. After conversion, however, the anusim evidently maintained their Jewish cohesion and religious life. It was undoubtedly this problem that continued to occupy Spanish sovereigns at the successive Councils of Toledo representing both the ecclesiastical and secular authorities...Thus, steps were taken to secure that the children of converts had a Christian religious education as well as to prevent the older generation from continuing to observe the Jewish rites or from failing to observe the Catholic ones. A system of strict supervision by the clergy over the way of life and movements of the anusim was imposed...\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Neofiti ===\u000aThe Neofiti were a group of crypto-Jews living in the Kingdom of Sicily, which included all of Southern Italy from the 13th to the 16th centuries.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Mediterranean and Asia ==\u000aThere have been several communities of Crypto-Jews in Muslim lands. The ancestors of the Daggatuns in Morocco are thought to have kept up their Jewish practices a long time after their nominal adoption of Islam. In Iran, a large community of Crypto-Jews lived in Mashhad, near Khorassan, where they were known as "Jedid al-Islam"; they were mass-converted to Islam around 1839 after the Allahdad events. Most of this community left for Israel in 1946. Some converted to Islam and remained in Iran. In one central Iranian village, local Muslims practice many Jewish customs, such as women lighting a candle on Friday night (the eve of the Jewish Sabbath). Before sundown on Friday, they prepare a small fire which they leave on throughout Saturday, so as not to ignite the fire on the Sabbath.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== India ===\u000aIn 1494, after the signing of the Treaty of Tordesillas, authorized by Pope Alexander VI, Portugal was given the right to found colonies in the Eastern Hemisphere. In the East, according to Walter Fischel, the Portuguese found use for the crypto-Jews in Goa and their other Indian and Asian possessions. Jews were used as "letter-carriers, translators, agents, etc." The ability of the Sephardic Jews and anusim to speak Arabic made them vital to Portuguese colonial ambitions in the East, where they could go on diplomatic and trade missions in the courts of the Mughal Empire and elsewhere. India also attracted Sephardic Jews and anusim for other reasons. In his lecture at the Library of Congress, Sanjay Subrahmanyam said that crypto-Jews were especially attracted to India because not only was it a center of trade in goods such as spices and diamonds, but India also had established and ancient Jewish settlements along its Western coast. Although Jews were able to openly worship in Southern and Eastern India with the Bene Israel, Malibar, Cochin, and Baghdadi Jewish communities, they experienced severe violence and persecution from the Muslim influence in Northwest Punjabi India. The presence of these older communities offered the anusim, who had been forced to accept Catholicism, the chance to live within the Portuguese Empire, away from the Inquisition, and, if they wished, they were able to contact the Jews in these communities and re-adopt the faith of their fathers. The presence of crypto-Jews in India aroused the anger of the Archbishop of Goa, Dom Gaspar Jorge de Leão Pereira and others who wrote polemics and letters to Lisbon urging that the Inquisition be brought to India. Twenty-four years after Portuguese Inquisition began, the Goan Inquisition came to India in 1560 after Francis Xavier \u2013 who was made a saint by the Catholic Church \u2013 placed a request for it to the King of Portugal. The Inquisition in all the Portuguese territories put roughly 45,000 people on trial with "the most active court being in Goa". The Goan Inquisition initially targeted anusim and Jews, but like the Inquisitions in Europe, it also targeted crypto-Muslims, and later Hindus. The Catholic Church destroyed a significant number of the Inquisitorial records, the number of victims in the Goan Inquisition is estimated to be roughly one-third of the total figure, based on the records which remain. The presence of crypto-Judaism in India continues to be an ongoing field of academic research.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Spanish America ==\u000aCrypto-Judaism was documented chiefly in Spanish-held colonial territories in northern Mexico. Numerous conversos joined Spanish and Portuguese expeditions, believing there was economic opportunity in the new lands, and that they would have more freedom at a distance far from Iberia. Different situations developed in the early colonial period of Mexico, the frontier province of Nuevo León, the later northern frontier provinces, and the colonial experience of the Mexican Inquisition The crypto-Jewish traditions have complex histories and are typically embedded in an amalgam of syncretic Roman Catholic and Judaic traditions. In many ways resurgent Judaic practices mirrored indigenous peoples' maintaining their traditions practiced loosely under a Roman Catholic veil. In addition, Catholicism was syncretic, absorbing other traditions and creating a new creole religion.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Early colonial period\u201416th century ===\u000aSome of the Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain went to Portugal, but in 1497 that country effectively converted all remaining Jewish children, making them wards of the state unless the parents also converted. Therefore, many of the early crypto-Jewish migrants to Mexico in the early colonial days were technically first to second-generation Portuguese with Spanish roots before that. The number of such Portuguese migrants was significant enough that Spanish colonists began to use "Portuguese" as a synonym for "Jewish" for their settlers. Immigration to Mexico offered lucrative trade possibilities in a well-populated colony with nascent Spanish culture. Some migrants believed that this region would be more tolerant since the lands were overwhelmingly populated by non-Christian indigenous peoples and it was far removed from the metropole.\u000aColonial officials believed that many crypto-Jews were going to Mexico during the 16th century and complained in written documents to Spain that Spanish society in Mexico would become significantly Jewish. Officials found and condemned clandestine synagogues in Mexico City. At this point, colonial administrators instituted the Law of the Pure Blood, which prohibited migration to Mexico for New Christians (Cristiano Nuevo), i.e. anyone who could not prove to be Old Christians for at least the last three generations. In addition, the administration initiated the Mexican Inquisition to ensure the Catholic orthodoxy of all migrants to Mexico. The Mexico Inquisition was also deployed in the traditional manner to ensure orthodoxy of converted indigenous peoples. The first victims of burnings (or autos de fé) of the Mexican Inquisition were indigenous converts convicted of heresy or crypto-Jews convicted of relapsing into their ancestral faith.\u000aExcept for those allowed to settle the province of Nuevo Leon under an exemption from the Blood Purity Laws, the number of conversos migrating to the New World was reduced.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Nuevo León (1590s to early 17th century) ===\u000aThe colonization of New Spain took place as a northward expansion over increasingly harsh geography, in regions that were occupied by tribes angered at the encroachment; they formed loose confederations of indigenous peoples to resist the settlers. Spain financed the expansion by exploiting mineral wealth, enslaving or forcing indigenous peoples to labor in mines. It established encomiendas for raising livestock, thereby displacing the local people. The indigenous peoples of the North-Eastern quadrant of New Spain (Nueva España) proved particularly resistant to colonial pressures. The Chichimec, Apache, and other tribes resisted conversion to Christianity, and avoided being impressed as laborers or slaves on Spanish ranches and in mines. The Spanish believed such peoples made the frontier (frontera) a lawless region.\u000aLuis Carvajal y de la Cueva, a royal accountant, was a Portuguese New Christian. He received a royal charter from the Spanish Crown to settle Nuevo León, a large expanse of land in the hostile frontier. Because of the dangers and difficulties of this region, Carvajal y de la Cueva received an exemption in his charter from the usual requirement that he prove that all new settlers were "Old Christians" (of at least three generations) rather than recently converted Jews or Muslims. This exemption allowed people to go to Nuevo León who were legally barred from entering New Spain elsewhere. Carvajal was authorized to bring 100 soldiers and 60 laborers to New Spain; many have been documented as Crypto-Jews.\u000a\u000aWith Carvajal as governor, Monterrey was established as the center (now in the state of Nuevo León). Within a few years, some people reported to authorities in Mexico City that Jewish rites were being performed in the Northern Province and efforts to convert heathen indigenous peoples were lax. The principal economic activity of Carvajal and his associates seems to have been capturing Indians and selling them into slavery. Carvajal's Lieutenant Governor, Gaspar Castaño de Sosa, led a large expedition to New Mexico in 1591 in an effort to establish a colony. Castaño was arrested for this unauthorized expedition and sentenced to exile in the Philippines. The sentence was later reversed, but he had already been killed in the Molucca Islands when the Chinese slaves on his ship mutinied.\u000aGovernor Carvajal, his immediate family members, and others of his entourage were called to appear before the Inquisition in Mexico City. They were arrested and jailed. The governor subsequently died in jail, prior to a sentence of exile. His niece Anna Carvajal had been tortured and implicated all the family in so-called charges. They were all executed by burning at the stake for relapsing into Judaism, except for one nephew who escaped arrest.\u000aThe governor's nephews changed their surname to Lumbroso. One of these was Joseph Lumbroso, also known as Luis de Carvajal el Mozo, who is said to have circumcised himself in the desert to conform to Jewish law. He committed suicide to avoid being burned at the stake. His memoirs, letters and inquisition record were preserved and are held in the archive. Two other nephews also changed their names to Lumbroso and migrated to Italy, where they became noted rabbis.\u000aWhen Carvajal was in office, the city of Monterrey became a destination for other crypto-Jews who wanted to escape the Mexican Inquisition in the south of the territory. Thus, Nuevo León and the founding of Monterrey are significant as they attracted crypto-Jewish migrants from all parts of New Spain. They created one of the earliest Jewish-related communities in Mexico. (The Jewish communities in modern Mexico, which practice their Judaism openly, were not established until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, after considerable immigration of Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Europe, and Mizrahi Jews from Turkey and Syria.)\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Former New Spain territories in United States, 17th\u201318th centuries ===\u000aDue to the Inquisition activities in Nuevo León, many crypto-Jewish descendants migrated to frontier colonies further west, using the trade routes passing through the towns of Sierra Madres Occidental and Chihuahua, Hermosillo and Cananea (Canaan), and to the north on the trade route to Paso del Norte and Santa Fe (both cities in the colonial Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico). Some even traveled to Alta California on the Pacific Coast.\u000aIn the late 20th century, in modern-day Southwestern United States specifically New Mexico, which was a former territory of New Spain, several Hispanos of New Mexico have stated a belief that they are descended from crypto-Jews of the colonial period. While most maintain their Roman Catholic and Christian faiths, they often cite as evidence memories of older relatives practicing Jewish traditions. Since the 1990s, the crypto-Jews of New Mexico have been extensively studied and documented by several research scholars, including Stanley M. Hordes, Janet Liebman Jacobs, Schulamith Halevy, and Seth D. Kunin, who calls them Hispanos. Kunin noted that most of this group in New Mexico has not formally embraced Judaism nor joined the organized Jewish community. Though some have been sceptical, such as Folklorist Judith Neulander arguing that people could be referring to traditions of modern Ashkenazi Jews migrants and Evangelical Protestant Christians who purposely acquired and employed Jewish traditions. More recently, Evangelical Protestant Christians have opened missionary groups aimed at cultivating evangelical doctrine in Southwestern American communities where crypto-Judaism had survived. The highly influential Hordes has been charged with "single-minded speculation based on largely ephemeral or highly ambiguous evidence" for his conclusion that modern-day Hispanos who claim crypto-Jewish roots are heirs to an unbroken chain of transmission. Kunin responded to some of this criticism in his book Juggling Identities: Identity and Authenticity Among the Crypto-Jews.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Peru ===\u000aIn Peru, conversos arrived at the time of the Spanish Conquest. At first, they had lived without restrictions because the Inquisition was not active there at the beginning of the Viceroyalty. With the advent of the Inquisition, New Christians began to be persecuted, and in some cases executed. The descendants of these colonial Sephardic Jewish descent converts to Christianity settled mainly in the north of the Andes and of the high jungle of Peru, where they married local women and became assimilated.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Colombia ===\u000aIn the department of Antioquia, Colombia, as well as in the greater Paisa region, some families also hold traditions and oral accounts of Jewish descent. In this population, Y-DNA genetic analysis has shown an origin of male founders predominantly from "southern Spain but also suggest that a fraction came from northern Iberia and that some possibly had a Sephardic origin". Medellín has a tradition of the marranada, where a pig is slaughtered, butchered and consumed on the streets of every neighborhood each Christmas. This custom has been interpreted as an annual affirmation of the rejection of Jewish law.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Bolivia ===\u000aA safe haven destination for Sephardic Conversos during the Spanish colonial was Santa Cruz de la Sierra. In 1557 many Crypto-Jews joined Ñuflo de Chávez and were among the pioneers who founded the city. During the 16th century some Crypto-Jews that faced persecution from the Inquisition and local authorities in nearby Potosí, La Paz and La Plata moved to Santa Cruz, as it was the most isolated urban settlement and because the Inquisition did not bother the Conversos there; as a frontier town it was meant to be a buffer to the Portuguese and Guaraní raids that threatened the mines of Peru. Some settled in the city of Santa Cruz and its adjacent towns, including Vallegrande, Postrervalle, Portachuelo, Terevinto, Pucarà, Bolivia, and Cotoca.\u000aSeveral of the oldest Catholic families in Santa Cruz are of Jewish ancestry on the paternal side; some practice certain traditions of Judaism. As recently as the 1920s, several families preserved seven-branched candlesticks and served dishes cooked with kosher practices. It is still customary among certain old families to light candles on Friday at sunset and to mourn the deaths of close relatives by sitting on the floor. After almost five centuries, some of the descendants of these families acknowledge Jewish ancestry, but practice Catholicism.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Costa Rica ===\u000aSome Crypto-Jews established themselves in the outskirts of San José, Costa Rica since the 16th century. They passed as Catholics in public and practiced their Jewish rituals in privacy. In the town of Itzkazú (modern day Escazú), some Crypto-Jewish families did not maintain secrecy. Locals started to associate their rituals and unintelligible prayers in Hebrew with witchcraft. Since then, Escazú has been known in Costa Rican folklore as the "city of the witches".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Elsewhere in Latin America ===\u000aIn addition to these communities, Roman Catholic-professing communities descended from male Crypto-Jews are said to exist in the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico and in various other countries of South America, such as Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Peru and Ecuador. From these communities comes the proverb, "Catholic by faith, Jewish by blood".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notable Crypto-Jews ==\u000aAntonio Fernandez Carvajal was a Portuguese merchant in London; "like other Marranos in London, Carvajal prayed at the Catholic chapel of the Spanish ambassador, while simultaneously playing a leading role in the secret Jewish community, which met at the clandestine synagogue at Creechurch Lane."\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Singer, Isidore; et al., eds.

aVIndustrialized and developing countries have distinctly different rates of teenage pregnancy. In developed regions, such as United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, teen parents tend to be unmarried and adolescent pregnancy is seen as a social issue.\u000aBy contrast, teenage parents in developing regions such as Africa, West Asia, South Asia, and the Pacific Islands are often married, and their pregnancy may be welcomed by family and society. However, in these societies, early pregnancy may combine with malnutrition and poor health care to cause medical problems. A report by Save the Children found that, annually, 13 million children are born to women under age 20 worldwide. More than 90% of these births occur to women living in developing countries. Complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of mortality among women between the ages of 15 and 19 in such areas, as they are the leading cause of mortality among older women.\u000aThe age of the mother is determined by the easily verified date when the pregnancy ends, not by the estimated date of conception. Consequently, the statistics do not include women who first became pregnant before their 20th birthdays, if those pregnancies did not end until on or after their 20th birthdays.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Rates by continent ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Africa ===\u000a\u000aThe highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the world \u2014 143 per 1,000 girls aged 15\u201319 years \u2014 is in sub-Saharan Africa. Women in Africa, in general, get married at much earlier ages than women elsewhere \u2014 leading to earlier pregnancies. In Nigeria, according to the Health and Demographic Survey in 1992, 47% of women aged 20\u201324 were married before 15 and 87% before 18. 53% of those surveyed also had given birth to a child before the age of 18. Teenage birth rates in African countries (2002) According to data from World Bank, as of 2015, the highest incidence of births among 15-19 years old girls was in: Niger, Mali, Angola, Guinea and Mozambique. \u000aA Save the Children report identified 10 countries where motherhood carried the most risks for young women and their babies. Of these, 9 were in sub-Saharan Africa, and Niger, Liberia, and Mali were the nations where girls were the most at-risk. In the 10 highest-risk nations, more than one in six teenage girls between the ages of 15 to 19 gave birth annually, and nearly one in seven babies born to these teenagers died before the age of one year.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Asia ===\u000aIn the Indian subcontinent, premarital sex is uncommon, but early marriage sometimes means adolescent pregnancy. The rate of early marriage is higher in rural regions than it is in urbanized areas. Fertility rates in South Asia range from 71 to 119 births a trend towards increasing age at marriage for both sexes. In South Korea and Singapore, although the occurrence of sexual intercourse before marriage has risen, rates of adolescent childbearing are low at 4 to 8 per 1000. The rate of early marriage and pregnancy has decreased sharply in Indonesia; however, it remains high in comparison to the rest of Asia.\u000aSurveys from Thailand have found that a significant minority of unmarried adolescents are sexually active. Although premarital sex is considered normal behavior for males, particularly with prostitutes, it is not always regarded as such for females. Most Thai youth reported that their first sexual experience, whether within or outside of marriage, was without contraception. The adolescent fertility rate in Thailand is relatively high at 60 per 1000. 25% of women admitted to hospitals in Thailand for complications of induced abortion are students. The Thai government has undertaken measures to inform the nation's youth about the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and unplanned pregnancy.\u000aAccording to the World Health Organization, in several Asian countries including Bangladesh and Indonesia, a large proportion (26-37%) of deaths among female adolescents can be attributed to maternal causes.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Australia ===\u000a\u000aIn 2015, the birth rate among teenage women in Australia was 11.9 births per 1,000 women. The rate has fallen from 55.5 births per 1,000 women in 1971, probably due to ease of access to effective birth control, rather than any decrease in sexual activity.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Europe ===\u000aThe overall trend in Europe since 1970 has been a decrease in the total fertility rate, an increase in the age at which women experience their first birth, and a decrease in the number of births among teenagers.\u000aThe rates of teenage pregnancy may vary widely within a country. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the rate of adolescent pregnancy in 2002 was as high as 100.4 per 1000 among young women living in the London Borough of Lambeth, and as low as 20.2 per 1000 among residents in the Midlands local authority area of Rutland. In Italy, the teenage birth rate in central regions is only 3.3 per 1,000, but, in the Mezzogiorno it is 10.0 per 1000.\u000aTeenage birth is often associated with economic and social issues: such as alcohol and drug misuse and, across 13 nations in the European Union, women who gave birth as teenagers were twice as likely to be living in poverty, compared with those who first gave birth when they were over 20.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Bulgaria and Romania ====\u000aRomania and Bulgaria have some of the highest teenage birth rates in Europe. As of 2015, Bulgaria had a birth rate of 37/1.000 women aged 15-19, and Romania of 34. Both countries also have very large Romani populations, who have an occurrence of teenage pregnancies well above the local average.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Netherlands ====\u000aThe Netherlands has a low rate of births and abortions among teenagers (5 births per 1,000 women aged 15\u201319 in 2002). Compared with countries with higher teenage birth rates, the Dutch have a higher average age at first intercourse and increased levels of contraceptive use (including the "double Dutch" method of using both a hormonal contraception method and a condom).\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Nordic countries ====\u000aNordic countries, such as Denmark and Sweden, also have low rates of teenage birth (both have 7 births per 1,000 women aged 15\u201319 in 2002). However, Norway's birth rate is slightly higher (11 births per 1,000 women aged 15\u201319 in 2002) and Iceland has a birth rate of 19 per 1,000 women aged 15\u201319  (nearly the same as the UK). These countries have higher abortion rates than the Netherlands.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Italy, Spain and Portugal ====\u000aIn some countries, such as Italy and Spain, the rate of adolescent pregnancy is low (6 births per 1,000 women aged 15\u201319 in 2002 in both countries). These two countries also have low abortion rates (lower than Sweden and the other Nordic countries) and their teenage pregnancy rates are among the lowest in Europe. Portugal, however, has a relatively high percentage of teenage pregnancy (17 births per 1,000 women aged 15\u201319 in 2002).\u000a\u000a\u000a==== United Kingdom ====\u000a\u000aThe UK has one of the highest teenage birth rates in Europe with a rate of 26.4 teenage births per 1,000 women aged 15\u201319 in 2006, down from 27.9 births in 2001. The UK also has a higher rate of abortion than most European countries. Of young Britons reported engaging in sexual intercourse whilst in their teens, 80% said they did not use a form of contraception (Citation needed), although a half of those under 16, and one-third of those between 16 and 19, said they did not use a form of contraception during their first encounter (Citation needed). 10% of British teen mothers are married. Adolescent pregnancy is viewed as a matter of concern by both the British government and the British press.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The Americas ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Canada ====\u000aThe Canadian teenage birth rate in 2002 was 16 per 1000  and the teenage pregnancy rate was 33.9. According to data from Statistics Canada, the Canadian teenage pregnancy rate has trended towards a steady decline for both younger (15-17) and older (18-19) teens in the period between 1992-2002. Canada's highest teen pregnancy rates occur in small towns located in rural parts of peninsular Ontario. Alberta and Quebec have high teen pregnancy rates as well.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Colombia ====\u000aIn 2016, the Minister of Health and Social Protection of Colombia, Alejandro Gaviria Uribe announced that "teenage pregnancy decreased by two percentage points breaking the growing tendency that had been seen since the nineties".\u000a\u000a\u000a==== United States ====\u000a\u000aIn 2013, the teenage birth rate in the United States reached a historic low: 26.6 births per 1,000 women aged 15\u201319. More than three-quarters of these births are to adult women aged 18 or 19. In 2005 in the U.S., the majority (57%) of teen pregnancies resulted in a live birth, 27% ended in an induced abortion, and 16% in a fetal loss.\u000aThe U.S. teen birth rate was 53 births per 1,000 women aged 15\u201319 in 2002, the highest in the developed world. If all pregnancies, including those that end in abortion or miscarriage, are taken into account, the total rate in 2000 was 75.4 pregnancies per 1,000 girls. Nevada and the District of Columbia have the highest teen pregnancy rates in the U.S., while North Dakota has the lowest. Over 80% of teenage pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended; approximately one third end in abortion, one third end in spontaneous miscarriage, and one third will continue their pregnancy and keep their baby.\u000aHowever, the trend is decreasing: in 1990, the birth rate was 61.8, and the pregnancy rate 116.9 per thousand. This decline has manifested across all races, although teenagers of African-American and Hispanic descent retain a higher rate, in comparison to that of European-Americans and Asian-Americans. The Guttmacher Institute attributed about 25% of the decline to abstinence and 75% to the effective use of contraceptives.\u000aWithin the United States teen pregnancy is often brought up in political discourse. The goal to limit teen pregnancy is shared by Republicans and Democrats, though avenues of reduction are usually different. Many Democrats cite teen pregnancy as proof of the continuing need for access to birth control and sexual education, while Republicans often cite a need for returning to conservative values, often including abstinence.\u000aAn inverse correlation has been noted between teen pregnancy rates and the quality of education in a state. A positive correlation, albeit weak, appears between a city's teen pregnancy rate and its average summer night temperature, especially in the Southern U.S. (Savageau, compiler, 1993\u20131995).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Statistics ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== World Development Indicator ===\u000aThe birth rate for women aged 15\u201319 is one of the World Bank's World Development Indicators.

aVThe Governor of Mersin (Turkish: Mersin Valili\u011fi) is the bureaucratic state official responsible for both national government and state affairs in the Province of Mersin. Similar to the Governors of the 80 other Provinces of Turkey, the Governor of Mersin is appointed by the Government of Turkey and is responsible for the implementation of government legislation within Mersin. The Governor is also the most senior commander of both the Mersin provincial police force and the Mersin Gendarmerie.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Appointment ==\u000aThe Governor of Mersin is appointed by the President of Turkey, who confirms the appointment after recommendation from the Turkish Government. The Ministry of the Interior first considers and puts forward possible candidates for approval by the cabinet. The Governor of Mersin is therefore not a directly elected position and instead functions as the most senior civil servant in the Province of Mersin.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Term limits ===\u000aThe Governor is not limited by any term limits and does not serve for a set length of time. Instead, the Governor serves at the pleasure of the Government, which can appoint or reposition the Governor whenever it sees fit. Such decisions are again made by the cabinet of Turkey. The Governor of Mersin, as a civil servant, may not have any close connections or prior experience in Mersin Province. It is not unusual for Governors to alternate between several different Provinces during their bureaucratic career.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Functions ==\u000a\u000aThe Governor of Mersin has both bureaucratic functions and influence over local government. The main role of the Governor is to oversee the implementation of decisions by government ministries, constitutional requirements and legislation passed by Grand National Assembly within the provincial borders. The Governor also has the power to reassign, remove or appoint officials a certain number of public offices and has the right to alter the role of certain public institutions if they see fit. Governors are also the most senior public official within the Province, meaning that they preside over any public ceremonies or provincial celebrations being held due to a national holiday. As the commander of the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces, the Governor can also take decisions designed to limit civil disobedience and preserve public order. Although mayors of municipalities and councillors are elected during local elections, the Governor has the right to re-organise or to inspect the proceedings of local government despite being an unelected position.\u000a\u000a\u000a== List of Governors of Mersin ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aGovernor (Turkey)\u000aMersin Province\u000aMinistry of the Interior (Turkey)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aBiography of the Governor of Mersin

aVBaby Gender Mentor is the trade name of a controversial blood test designed for prenatal sex discernment. The test was manufactured by Acu-Gen Biolab, Inc., a biotech company in Lowell, Massachusetts, United States. The test made a media debut on 17 June 2005 on The Today Show and it was featured in Newsweek in October 2005. About 4,500 people had purchased the test by March 2006.\u000aThe test claimed that it offered an alternative to amniocentesis and ultrasound. Gender Mentor claimed that women had many motivations for using the test to learn the sex of their fetuses early in pregnancy, including mental preparation and planning gender-specific purchases, or more controversially, sex-selective abortion.\u000aCustomers and scientists have questioned the accuracy of the test,. Legal actions were taken against Acu-Gen and their supplier. The lawsuits claimed that Acu-Gen's products do not accurately predict the sex of the baby. In their defense, Acu-Gen stated that ultrasound prediction of the sex of a fetus is not always accurate, and told one family their baby had gender abnormalities.\u000aWomen were instructed to prick their finger to draw a small amount of blood, which was placed on a card to be sent to Acu-Gen to be analyzed for US$250. The kit did not require regulation since it did not diagnose, prevent or treat a disease. The company was not obliged to disclose results of tests.\u000aAcu-Gen listed studies related to detecting fetal blood cells present in maternal circulation, but studies did not refer specifically to the Baby Gender Mentor test. The company claimed that their kit could detect twins.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Initial media attention ==\u000aThe test was featured on an episode of The Today Show in June 2005. In that show, Katie Couric interviewed a woman named Holly Osburn who was mother to two daughters and expecting. Osborn said that she wanted to know the gender because she wanted to paint the nursery blue. Sherry Bonelli, the CEO of PregnancyStore.com was also interviewed and said that the test had only been available for two weeks and that numerous people had inquired about it in a short time. She also said that Acu-Gen had followed 2,000 pregnancies through to completion and that the lab results given by the Baby Gender Mentor had never been wrong . Gender Mentor claimed to have been used in 20,000 pregnancies. On the show the results of Osborn's test revealed that was going to have another girl. During the same segment of The Today Show, Couric interviewed Dr. Ronald Wapner, head of maternal fetal medicine at New York Presbyterian Hospital, He discussed possible pros and cons of the test. His first concern was whether the stated accuracy rate achieved in the 2,000 test cases would be realized in real world usage. His second concern was whether couples who purchase the test might use the results for family balancing, which means the decision to utilize selective abortion to achieve a baby of the desired sex. Wapner said that one positive aspect of the Baby Gender Mentor test is the non-invasive nature of the test, which means there should be no risk of harm to the fetus.\u000aThe test was listed as one of the top 10 innovations of 2005 by research company DataMonitor. In their report, titled Build A Better Mousetrap, Datamonitor identifies their picks for "the best new food, drink, health, household and pet products of 2005". They listed the test as the number 8 innovation of the year.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Accuracy of the test disputed ==\u000aAt least 40 women have come forward to say their Baby Gender Mentor tests predicted the wrong sex. According to a National Public Radio (NPR) report, the company has explained certain inaccurate results as being the result of a vanishing twin, a fetus that stopped growing soon after fertilization. Acu-Gen claimed that their kit could predict a mixed sex set of fraternal twins, so the test should have predicted twins instead of predicting a single baby whose sex turned out to be incorrect.\u000aWith Acu-Gen choosing not to publish proof of its claims and evidence of several women receiving inaccurate predictions, doctors are concerned about the test. Among the scientific evidence cited by Acu-Gen's web site is a paper co-authored by Diana Bianchi, an expert on fetal DNA at Tufts University. The NPR story quoted Bianchi as saying, "I think at the present time we need to be concerned whether the test is accurate or not", and "I think it's caveat emptor. Let the buyer beware." Another criticism has come from Sandra Carson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology and involved in research in sex selection. Carson says, "Until Acu-Gen releases its data, there's no way to know the test's reliability. Until that's out, I think it shouldn't be on the market." Carson at that time was at the Baylor College of Medicine. Dr. Charles Lockwood, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale School of Medicine, said that it is possible for fetal DNA to be found in maternal blood as soon as the placenta has developed, and that detection after five weeks "is not impossible" and the president of Acu-Gen said the suit was "totally bogus".\u000aThere are multiple legal challenges and investigations under way. Gail O'Conner, a spokesperson for the Illinois State Attorney General, says that they are investigating PregnancyStore.com for possible fraud. Florida Congressman Jim Davis has urged the FDA to investigate Acu-Gen, and the Florida Attorney General has opened an investigation against Acu-Gen. A law firm named Gainey & McKenna has filed a class action lawsuit and at least one other firm is inviting people to contact them about their legal rights if they are unhappy with the results of their test. Gainey & McKenna's lawsuit seeks to bar the company from false advertising in marketing its test and to compel the firm to honor its money-back guarantee. The law firm cites seven areas of contention, including the veracity of the accuracy claims and the violation of HIPAA and other laws.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Possible uses for test ==\u000aParents have cited an interest in preparing themselves or the baby's siblings for gender-specific issues. Some women might prefer this test to an ultrasound exam, which might reveal fetal abnormalities that the parents might prefer not to know about until after delivery.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Concerns about sex selection ===\u000aThe National Public Radio investigative report on Acu-Gen predicted that parents may use the Baby Gender Mentor test as a basis for determining whether to get a sex-selective abortion. KMSP-TV interviewed genetic counselor Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction. The concern is that learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. Americans United for Life argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early. They say that women who want to have a specific sex will be learning the results at a time when it is safer for them to have an abortion, without the complications associated with aborting later in pregnancy.\u000aSome bioethicists believe that sex selection is an ethical problem and could be disruptive to society. Charles Lockwood of Yale says, "a disproportionate number of female fetuses have been terminated worldwide, and a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio could lead to social unrest and wars." According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys. Punjab's Health Minister Ramesh Chander Dogra has said he will take action to ban the test in India.\u000aThe website for the PregnancyStore.com says that they will ship the tests only within the United States, Sheila McLean, professor of medical ethics at Glasgow University, is critical of the kits.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Alleged use for medical diagnoses ===\u000aAcu-Gen's website states the test was not a medical test:\u000aTests similar to the Baby Gender Mentor test can be used for medical diagnoses. For instance, scientists have shown that it is possible to use fetal DNA from a woman's blood to screen the fetus for genetic defects such as Down syndrome. In a validation study sponsored by the National Institute for Child Health and Development, 5 different labs used fetal cells from maternal blood to search for evidence of Down syndrome in 2,744 pregnancies. On average, the labs correctly spotted Down syndrome babies 74% of the time.\u000aIn at least one case, Chang Wang, the president of Acu-Gen, has phoned a pregnant woman one month after giving her the sex prediction to inform her that her test indicated an "excess of genetic material in her blood" and advised her to see her doctor in order "to rule out problems like Down's syndrome or Trisomy 18". Wang explains this means "with a certain possibility, that her fetus has a kind of genetic problem. Of course later on, we had used our technology to prove that she has a chromosome problem: Trisomy 18. That means that this baby [is] going to have a developmental problem and is going to probably cease to exist right after the birth." Dr. Diana Bianchi of Tufts disputes the possibility of the test being used for such a diagnosis. She says, "The test involves looking at genetic sequences on the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. If he gave a diagnosis of Trisomy 18, that involves a different chromosome, Chromosome 18. That is certainly something that is not advertised in the packaging associated with the test. "It is possible that, upon being told of a problem by Acu-Gen, a woman may seek to have an amniocentesis or other invasive procedure which may be an unnecessary risk if the Acu-Gen diagnosis was in error. In this case, the woman delivered a healthy baby free from both Trisomy 18 and Down syndrome.\u000aThe class action lawsuit filed by Gainey & McKenna alleges that Acu-Gen is improperly dispensing medical advice. The law firm claims Wang has contacted "many women" and advised them that their fetuses have chromosomal abnormalities. They claim that Dr. Wang, who is listed as a Ph.D., is providing women "with all sorts of medical advice and diagnoses". They say their clients have suffered great emotional distress and have undergone unnecessary medical testing based upon Dr. Wang's "advice".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Warranty and availability ==\u000aAcu-Gen has allegedly created new requirements for people who want to take advantage of the money-back guarantee. The attorney Barry Gainey, of Gainey & McKenna, says that Chang Wang, Acu-Gen's President, is "making people send in the original birth certificate. He's making them get blood tests from the newborn baby. And there's other requirements that he's now adding to the refund in order to avoid paying back these people and giving them the 200-percent refund." None of those requirements were on the boxes shipped to early customers, but the requirements have since appeared on Acu-Gen's website. Gainey has filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of 40 people who claim they received inaccurate results but were unable to obtain refunds from Acu-Gen.\u000aThere have been conflicting reports about how often the company has refunded money to consumers who received an erroneous result with the test. In February 2006, Wang said, "We don't mistakes  [sic]. Period." Yet in October 2005 he had stated his company had issued four refund checks, including one for a case involving a vanishing twin. The PregnancyStore.com states that none of the refund checks were issued as a result of the test being proven wrong by a live birth. Their website states:\u000aIn March 2006, Wang wrote in an e-mail to NPR, he has "decided to defer all his energies regarding the BGM product and service for one more year, when results of actual births compared to the results provided by Baby Gender Mentor should answer any concern about the accuracy of the test."\u000aInitial news reports and the Acu-Gen website touted a 200% money-back guarantee. In May 2006, Baby Gender Mentor website was modified to show a different warranty than the one that had originally promised to refund 200% of the purchase price of the test. The new warranty states:\u000aPregnancyStore.com also updated their website to state that the warranty was only 100% of the purchase price. In July 2006, the PregnancyStore.com reported that the test was "currently out of stock", and In-Gender.com, a commercial sales blog, reported that the test has been completely pulled from the market in India. As of January 2007, PregnancyStore.com no longer contains any mention of the kit on their website, although the BabyGenderMentor.com website does contain a form for on-line purchasing of the kit.\u000a\u000a\u000a== About Acu-Gen ==\u000aAcu-Gen is a biotech company in Lowell, Massachusetts and is led by Chang-ning Wang, the company's President. A National Public Radio reporter visited the address given as the headquarters of Acu-Gen in September 2005. They found that the building at that address contains a Hindu temple and a company called BioTronics, but no sign for Acu-Gen. According to NPR, their inquiries at BioTronics revealed the two companies have common ownership, but no one was available to comment for the NPR story. Acu-Gen does not mention a direct link to BioTronics in their marketing materials. However, they do state on their web-site that they utilize BioTronics' AmpliSensor technology, according to the Baby Gender Mentor website. AmpliSensor is a quantitative PCR assay invented by Wang and marketed by BioTronics, according to the Baby Gender Mentor website.\u000aA news crew from television station WFTS, an American Broadcasting Company (ABC) affiliate, visited the Acu-Gen offices in February 2006. They found "about six employees inside Wang's lab, some putting together sex test kits, others doing some type of lab work. There was a room full of machines Chang said he created, and shelves stacked with blood samples supposedly sent in by women from across the United States." BioTronics does make a laboratory instrument known as an AG-9600 AmpliSensor Analyzer, which is used for quantitative DNA analysis.\u000aIt is not known whether the two journalists visited the same address, nor is it known whether Acu-Gen and BioTronics currently share office or laboratory space. As of January 2007, Acu-Gen lists their address as "50 Stedman Street, Lowell, MA". On December 2, 2006 BioTronics' trademark on "AmpliSensor" (U.S. trademark registration number 1958576) was declared dead and cancelled. At that time, BioTronics' address was listed as "44 Stedman Street, Unit 5, Lowell, MA".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes and references ==\u000a\u000a55.Clinic for Baby gender selection Gender selection issues and advice.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000aWang, CNJ; Wu KY; Wang H (1995).

aVElmore is a town in Elmore County, Alabama, United States. Although initially incorporated in 1906, it lapsed and was not reincorporated again until 1997. At the 2010 census the population was 1,262, up from 199 in 2000. It is part of the Montgomery Metropolitan Statistical Area.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geography ==\u000aElmore is located in western Elmore County at 32°32\u203232\u2033N 86°18\u203256\u2033W (32.542314, -86.315455). It is bordered to the west by Millbrook and to the south by Coosada. Alabama State Route 14 passes through the town, leading east 7 miles (11 km) to Wetumpka and west 10 miles (16 km) to Prattville.

aVHouston has a large and diverse LGBT population and is home to the 4th largest gay pride parade in the nation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aAccording to Ray Hill, a Montrose resident quoted in the Houston Press, before the 1970s, the city's gay bars were spread around Downtown Houston and what is now Midtown Houston. Gays and lesbians needed to have a place to socialize after the closing of the gay bars. They began going to Art Wren, a 24-hour restaurant in Montrose, a community of empty nesters and widows. LGBT community members were attracted to Montrose as a neighborhood after encountering it while patronizing Art Wren, and they began to gentrify the neighborhood and assist the widows with the maintenance of their houses. Within Montrose, new gay bars began to open. By 1985, the flavor and politics of the neighborhood were heavily influenced by the LGBT community. and in 1990, according to Hill, 19% of the residents of Montrose were LGBT. Paul Broussard was murdered in Montrose in 1991.\u000aIn the 2000s many LGBT individuals began moving to Westbury and several began referring to it as "Little Montrose". By 2009 some were also moving to Riverside Terrace. By 2011 many LGBT people moved to the Houston Heights and to suburbs in Greater Houston, and according to Hill, possibly less than 8% of Montrose's population was LGBT. Decentralization of Houston's LGBT population with the increasing LGBT acceptance in the city caused business at gay bars in Montrose to decline. Hill stated that "Gay bars used to be places where we had to go to get refuge because we were not welcome anywhere else. Well, guess what? There's nowhere we're not welcome anymore." The suburbs especially attracting gays are Pearland, Sugar Land, and Missouri City.\u000aIn February 2015 a 17-year-old gay student at Lutheran High School North reported that the school forced him to leave since he refused to take down YouTube videos discussing his sexuality. The school's executive director, Wayne Kramer, referred to the student handbook, which stated: "Lutheran High North reserves the right, within its sole discretion, to refuse admission of an applicant and/or to discontinue enrollment of a current student participating in, promoting, supporting or condoning: pornography, sexual immorality, homosexual activity or bisexual activity".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Economy ==\u000aJordan Blum of the Houston Chronicle stated in 2016 that levels of LGBT acceptance and discrimination vary throughout the Houston energy industry. Around the 1990s BP, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, and several other companies offered benefits and protection to LGBT employees equal to that of straight employees. According to Blum many LGBT-identifying persons told him that several companies have cultures non-supportive of LGBT-identifying persons and that some had "described thinly veiled or blatant discrimination." Blum stated that "In many ways, the energy sector mirrors Houston's dual identities - the diverse, innovative, big-business urban image clashing with a conservative culture, deeply rooted in Christian faith."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Institutions ==\u000a\u000aThe Houston GLBT Community Center is located in the Dow School in the Sixth Ward of Houston.\u000aThe Montrose Center is a LGBT community center located in the Montrose district of Houston.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Politics and activism ==\u000a\u000aMichael Ennis of the Texas Monthly stated in 1980 that within Texas, "gay political inroads" were "most visible" in Houston. In the October 1979 Village Voice Richard Goldstein wrote that due to the perceived threat from the "Christian right" in the area, gay people in Houston "take politics more seriously" than those in New York City.\u000aThe Marriage of Billie Ert and Antonio Molina, the first gay marriage in Texas, took place in 1972, although it was later voided by the Texas Attorney General.\u000aIn 1978 Steve Shifflet, a former Young Republican, became the head of the Houston Gay Political Caucus (HGPC). He advocated for using bloc-voting so gay people could get their preferred candidates. That year, the LGBT bloc-voted to put Mickey Leland in the Congressional seat formerly held by Barbara Jordan, and Leland personally thanked the HGPC.\u000aIn 1979 Montrose became included in a single-member Houston City Council district and therefore increasing LGBT political representation.\u000aIn 1980 Montrose was in Texas Legislative District 79. That year, Ennis stated that according to "[l]ocal politicians" the district "will now go the way the gay vote goes."\u000aIn the fall 1979 election for Houston City Council, Eleanor Tinsley, a liberal, and Frank Mann, a conservative, competed for an at-large city council district. Tinsley attracted LGBT voters while Mann referred to them as "oddwads and queers" as a way of polarizing those opposing the LGBT community into voting for him. Due to the support of the LGBT community, Tinsley defeated Mann.\u000aIn 2002 voters in the City of Houston had passed Proposition 2, which outlawed the city government from giving same-sex partners of municipal employees benefits.\u000aIn 2010 Annise Parker, a lesbian woman, was voted Mayor of Houston, making that city the first large American city to vote an openly homosexual person as a mayor. This made Parker the LGBT official in the United States with the largest constituency. Parker had been elected to political offices in the city government six previous times. Miguel Bustillo of The Wall Street Journal stated that this occurred "with little controversy over her sexual preference". \u000a\u000a\u000a== Media ==\u000aOutSmart is a monthly LGBT magazine in Houston. In 2008 the Houston Press ranked it the "Best Local Magazine."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Culture ==\u000a\u000aIn previous eras, gay people in the area attended gay rock and roll clubs. By 1980, gay Houstonians were still going to disco clubs, while among straight people disco was a fad.\u000aCharles Armstrong owns four gay clubs in Houston, with two of them being South Beach and Montrose Mining Company; Mandy Oaklander of the Houston Press wrote in 2011 that Armstrong's clubs were "the most successful clubs in Houston's gay scene".\u000aIn 2002 Jeremy Quittner of The Advocate wrote that "it would seem" one could be prevented from being in the "superelite" of Houston for being homosexual; he stated this in reference to Michael J. Kopper, the chief assistant of Enron CFO Andrew Fastow.\u000aThe Gay Men's Chorus of Houston is the premier predominately gay male chorus in the Houston metro. The men's chorus was founded in 1979 and has a predominately lesbian counterpart known as the Bayou City Women's Chorus. The women's chorus was established in 2005.\u000a"Out at the Rodeo" week is held annually at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in March. During this week, there are several events acknowledging and celebrating the LGBT community in conjunction with the festival.\u000aThe Houston Gay Pride Parade is the largest pride parade in Texas. Pride Houston (parade organizers) has been able to attract approximately 200,000 spectators from Houston and beyond for the annual June event. For the first time since its inception, the parade has moved from Montrose to Downtown Houston for 2015. The reason cited for the move is that downtown has the space and resources to improve the quality and size of the event.\u000aHouston's annual Gay and Lesbian Film Festival is organized by Qfest. Qfest was founded in 1996 and sponsors several events throughout the year.\u000aHouston's Splash is established as one of the premier black gay and lesbian events in the country. The event began in 1995 and is held every second week in May. It is the largest event of its kind in the Gulf Coast Region and attracts thousands during its 5-day span of activities celebrating the black gay community.\u000aThe epicenter of Houston's gay community and nightlife is the Montrose district.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Religion ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Christianity ===\u000aSome Christian churches accept members of the LGBT community. In 2008 Reverend Dwayne Johnson, the pastor of the Resurrection Metropolitan Community Church, a church in the Houston Heights, stated that there were about 15-20 openly gay Christian clergy members in Houston.\u000aResurrection Metropolitan's main service group is the LGBT community. In 1980 the pastor was gay, and almost all of the congregation was LGBT. In December 2010 Reverend Harry Knox, a pro-LGBT activist, became the leader of the Resurrection Metropolitan. In 2011 Resurrection Metropolitan had 850 members.\u000aOver the years a number of Evangelical/Pentecostal GLBT affirming churches have also ministered to the Houston Community. Community Gospel Church began in the early 1980's and served the community until 2012, with about 150 members at its' height. In 2012, Gateway of Hope Church [1] was birthed as a Pentecostal/Word of Faith, Spirit Filled, Word Based, Jesus Centered fellowship meeting off of Dacoma Street and Hempstead Highway and is pastored by Pastor Sven Verbeet. It is affiliated with the Covenant Network and serves not only the Houston area, but also active missions works in the Philippines and India. Founded in 2010 Living Mosaic Christian Church [2] is an independent, nondenominational fellowship, pastored by Rev. Jason Wood meets at the Montrose Counseling Center. Living Mosaic's worship style is a liturgical and evangelical blend.\u000aIn 1995 Grace Evangelican Lutheran Church began accepting LGBT members and became a "Reconciling in Christ" Lutheran church; it was founded in 1922. In 2008 Rene Garcia, a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), stated that she estimated that 40% of the members identified themselves as LGBT, with many of them coming from other Christian denominations such as Missouri Synod Lutheranism and Roman Catholicism.\u000aIn 2008 pro-LGBT activist Jay Bakker argued that Joel Osteen, pastor of Lakewood Church, should speak out in favor of the LGBT community, and invited him to join his group in a picnic.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Judaism ===\u000aThe group Keshet Houston is a non-profit organization that connects Jewish LGBT people in the Houston area. They connect Jewish people with LGBT affirming synagogues as well as holding their own social and religious events. Keshet Houston has participated in the Houston Pride Parade since 2014, and in 2015 the first legally married same-sex couple from Texas rode on their float.\u000aTemple Emanu El is an LGBT friendly congregation whose leaders have spoken out against LGBT discrimination, and participated in events that seek to end this discrimination in Texas.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Islam ===\u000aHouston has a large number of Muslim residents, constituting approximately 1.2% of the population. After the Pulse shooting that occurred in Orlando, Florida in June 2016, M.J. Khan, the president of the Islamic Society of Greater Houston denounced the shooter, and said that the Muslim community stands in solidarity with LGBT people.

aVThe Second Green Revolution is a change in [[agricultural production]] widely thought necessary to feed and sustain the growing population on Earth These calls have precipitated in part, as a response to rising food commodity prices, and fears of peak oil among other factors.\u000aIt is named after the Green Revolution, a movement to increase crop selection and agrichemical usage to increase yield in the 1930s through to the 1960s.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Methods ==\u000aIt is thought that genetic engineering of new crops and foods will take the lead in producing increased crop yield and nutrition.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Proponents ==\u000aBill Gates has been among the proponents of a second green revolution, saying:\u000a\u000aThree quarters of the world's poorest people get their food and income by farming small plots of land...if we can make smallholder farming more productive and more profitable, we can have a massive impact on hunger and nutrition and poverty...the charge is clear\u2014we have to develop crops that can grow in a drought; that can survive in a flood; that can resist pests and disease...we need higher yields on the same land in harsher weather."\u000a\u000aGates made these remarks during the World Food Prize. He has made over 1.4 billion in contributions towards agricultural developments.\u000aThe then Union Finance Minister of India, Pranab Mukherjee, made a statement to parliament that he would explore the possibility of setting up a committee of CMs of the eastern states for a second green revolution in the region and praised Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal for substantial increase in rice production during the current fiscal. Replying to the debate on 2012-13 Union Budget in Rajya Sabha, Mukherjee said due to substantial increase in rice output in the eastern states to the tune of 7 million tonnes in 2011-12, production of the staple grain has risen to a record 10.2 million tonnes. He said this was possible because of special thrust given on realizing the agricultural potential of eastern states.\u000aAccepting the suggestion of JD(U) member N K Singh, Mukherjee said he would explore the possibility of setting up a committee of chief ministers of eastern states "to give further impetus to achieving green revolution" in the region. Singh had suggested setting up of such a panel. He said: "Given the importance of incentivizing agriculture in the eastern region, a chief ministers' committee comprising the CMs from the eastern states should be constituted for a coherent action plan and adequate support from the central government". His suggestion came as one of the eight "tangible actions" which, he thought, would lend credibility to the budgetary announcements. The government had earlier allocated an additional Rs 400 crore in 2011-12 under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana for extending green revolution to the eastern region comprising Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Eastern UP, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and West Bengal. Rice was a priority crop under the scheme. Seeing the success of the scheme, the Budget 2012-13 has raised the allocation to Rs 1,000 crore.\u000aMukherjee lauded CMs of these states, particularly Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, whose state has doubled rice output to 67.5 lakh tonnes in 2011-12. Handsome increase in rice production has also been witnessed in Jharkhand, West Bengal and other eastern states.\u000aNoting that the achievement has attracted accolades from world over, he said the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Indonesia-based World Rice Institute have commended the eastern states.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Opponents ==\u000aOpponents views include social inequity as a major factor in food insecurity not addressed by increasing food production capacity.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other usage ==\u000aOthers have used the term to refer to a combination of urban agriculture, smaller farm size and organic agriculture with the aim of increasing resource sustainability of crop production.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aPlant breeding\u000aTransgenic plant\u000aUrban agriculture\u000aFuture food technology\u000aAgricultural robot\u000aCultured meat\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVColonel Sir Vivian Dering Majendie,  (18 July 1836 \u2013 25 March 1898) was one of the first bomb disposal experts and Chief Inspector of Explosives to Queen Victoria from 1871 until his death in 1898.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aThe son of Major John Routledge Majendie (1801\u20131850) and his wife Harriet Mary Dering (1806\u20131893), and the grandson of Henry Majendie, the Bishop of Bangor, Vivian Majendie was educated at Leamington College before joining the Royal Artillery in 1854. Promoted to second lieutenant on 23 October 1854, he saw action during the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny. From 1861 to 1871 Majendie served as Captain Instructor and Assistant Superintendent at the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. In 1871 he was appointed Chief Inspector of Explosives, a position he held until his death in 1898. He was the President of the Association of Mining Engineers and was one of the first bomb disposal experts.\u000a\u000aAs a major in the Royal Artillery Majendie investigated an explosion on 2 October 1874 in the Regent's Canal when the barge 'Tilbury', carrying six barrels of petroleum and five tons of gunpowder blew up, killing the crew and destroying Macclesfield Bridge and cages at nearby London Zoo. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1875 for framing a Bill which became 'The Explosives Act, 1875', and a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1895. His advice during the Fenian dynamite campaign of 1881\u201385 was officially recognised as having contributed to the saving of lives. After Victoria Station was bombed on 26 February 1884 he defused a bomb with a clockwork mechanism which might have gone off at any moment.\u000aIn October 1886 Majendie visited the United States to observe the petroleum industry there and to examine the regulations regarding storage and distribution of that product. A caricature of Majendie by Leslie Ward ('Spy') appeared in Vanity Fair on 23 April 1892. His publications included Up Among the Pandies (1859), Ammunition. A Descriptive Treatise on the Different Projectiles, Charges, Fuses, Rockets, &c. (1867), The Arms and Ammunition of the British Service (1868), and The Official Guide to the Explosives Act (1877).\u000aMajendie married Adelaide Frances Grylls (1841\u20131866) and had two children, a daughter and Captain Henry Grylls Majendie (1865\u20131900) who was killed during the Boer War while serving with the Rifle Brigade.\u000aVivian Dering Majendie died of heart failure in 1898 while visiting his sister in Oxford.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a'Death of Colonel Majendie' in the National Library of New Zealand website\u000aPortraits of Sir Vivian Dering Majendie at the National Portrait Gallery, London \u000aThe Majendie Family Crest on My Family Silver website

aVIn mathematics, the arguments of the maxima (abbreviated arg max or argmax) are the points of the domain of some function at which the function values are maximized.

aVHeart Prairie Lutheran Church of Whitewater, Wisconsin was a historic church organized in 1844 by pioneer Lutheran minister, Claus Lauritz Clausen.\u000aBefore the church was built, services were held under oak trees, in the Lyman School, and in log cabins. One of those early log cabins, owned by Gundar Halvorsen, now sits on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. The Norwegian pioneers began hauling brick by oxcart to build the present church, which was completed between 1855 and 1857. About this time the congregation joined with congregations at Whitewater, Palmyra and Sugar Creek to call the same Lutheran pastor.\u000aDuring the later 19th century the congregation grew to over 100 members. After 1880 an organist played a reed pump organ that led the congregational hymns. The Norwegian language was used in the church until 1902. It was only then that the English language was introduced into the services, but not used exclusively until 1920. During the early 1900s membership began declining as a result of families moving out of the Heart Prairie area. Finally in 1948, because of dwindling membership, the congregation merged with First English Lutheran Church of Whitewater.\u000aThe church, which became known for its historical, architectural and religious features, is included on the National Register of Historic Places. Historically this church may be the oldest Norwegian Lutheran Church in America still being used in its original state. Architecturally the church is a lasting example of pioneer building. Brick was used not only to build walls, but also to supply ornamental and decorative details.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other sources ==\u000aFroemming, Larry F.

From 1905 to 1910, he coached women's basketball at Barnard College, a women's liberal arts college affiliated with Columbia University. In December 1910, The New York Times reported on Fauver's success in developing the women's basketball program at Barnard: "Barnard College students are keen for basket ball. In fact they are so keen that Dr. Edgar Fauver, the athletic coach, is beset, three times a week, by one hundred enthusiasts, all clamoring at once for a place on the teams."\u000aIn 1909, Fauver also introduced baseball at Barnard College. In June 1910, The Washington Post reported on Fauver's experiment with women's baseball:\u000a\u000a"Baseball for college girls was introduced at Barnard College a year ago this spring by Edgar Fauver, assistant professor of physical education at Columbia University. He conceived the idea of teaching them to play the national game with a few slight modifications, and so successful was the idea that before the end of the year more than half the students were playing. This year there is even more interest in the game, which Prof. Fauver has taught to practically every girl at Barnard. From 40 to 60 girls are to be found playing nearly every day, and there is a regular series of class games in which the greatest rivalry is shown. Two other colleges for women have taken up the game this spring, and Prof. Fauver believes it will be the principal outdoor sport of practically all the colleges for women within the next few years.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Camp Pemigewassett ===\u000aIn 1908, Fauver and his brother Edwin founded Camp Pemigewassett in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.

Fauver predicted the scrapping of college athletics unless "the commercial evil" was not overcome. He pointed out that the lure of immense gate receipts and the need to maintain an elaborate athletic system would result in attempts to get winning teams at any price and by any means.\u000aIn 1937, Fauver retired as Wesleyan's athletic director to devote himself to his duties as Wesleyan's college physician.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Family and later years ==\u000aIn 1908, Fauver married Alice C.

aVMilagro en Roma (Miracle in Rome) is a 1988 Colombian film directed by Lisandro Duque Naranjo and based upon The long happy life of Margarito Duarte, a story by Colombian novelist Gabriel García Márquez, originally published in 1981. The film follows the story of Margarito Duarte, a man whose daughter died under sudden and inexplicable circumstances. Disinterred years later, her body is discovered in pristine condition, having undergone no apparent decomposition. Unwilling to bury his daughter once again, Margarito struggles with the Vatican to have his daughter canonized as a saint.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000aMargarito Duarte is a modest employee of the local court in Filandia, a small Colombian town on the slopes of the Andes. Abandoned by his wife, Margarito is devoted to his only child, Evelia, his seven-year-old daughter. One day, after Evelia\u2019s school day is over, Margarito waits for his daughter at home with a present, an acrobatic flipping monkey. Evelia barely has time to give a kiss and hug her father in gratitude for the present when she dies, suddenly, for no apparent reason.\u000aTwelve years later, Margarito visits the cemetery to exhume the remains of his child in order to prevent them from being placed in a mass grave after the parish has decided to construct a new cemetery. Taking the corpse out of its crypt, Margarito is surprised to find Evelia\u2019s body intact. She looks as if she had just gone to sleep, although the coffin is rotted all around her. This creates a commotion at the cemetery, where people believe that this is a miracle and that the child might be a saint. The event has such profound effect on the town that the local priest invites the bishop of Armenia to determine the religious nature of what has taken place. The bishop is surprised to see not only that Evelia looks in perfect condition but that the girl\u2019s body is even warm. The bishop questions Margarito regarding the girl's religious background and the priest mentions that the toy monkey began to work unexpectedly at the funeral. However, the bishop is skeptical. Not believing there has been a miracle, he orders the girl\u2019s body to be buried again. Also, he specifies that the coffin should be watered to help decompose the body. However, now that Margarito has regained his child, he has no intention of committing a crime by drowning her. At the very moment that the bishop is making his visit, a total solar eclipse takes place. For the people of Filandia, there is not doubt. Turning against the bishop and, indirectly supporting Margarito\u2019s intentions, the crowd screams that the girl is a saint. All working together, they organize an emergency collection, raising a considerable amount of money in order to send father and daughter off to Rome, "for the Holy Father to decide about the miracle."\u000aIn Rome, Margarito is welcome by the Colombian ambassador and his secretary, who are fully aware of the political advantages to be gained from facilitating the process of verifying the first Colombian saint. The secretary of the ambassador arranges for Margarito to live as the roommate of Antonio, a fellow Colombian and opera singer who is pursuing a career as a soloist tenor. Margarito moves with Antonio, but rejects the help of the embassy as he does not want to politicize his daughter's sainthood process. Alone, sober and dignified, Margarito takes his daughter's case in front of the Vatican ecclesiastic authorities armed with a letter of recommendation and a large lunch box type suitcase in which he carries his daughter everywhere. Margarito does not have much success, as he faces the well intentioned, but bureaucratic Vatican curia, who recommends the embassy route to promote the launching of the beatification process. Things seem not going anywhere until Margarito meets a bishop willing to personally help him. However, this bishop turns out to be an impostor who swindles Margarito from most of his money.\u000aAntonio has a singing test that will help him to move forward his opera career. While he sings, the windows are broken apparently by the power of his voice. He is congratulated in a presentation not seen since the time of Caruso. Antonio attributes this event to Margarito, who he considers the true saint, admiring his friend's devotion for his daughter, his dignified attitude and his tenacity. Besieged by the secretary of the Colombian embassy and the Italian mortuary authorities, who want to have the body buried, Margarito pleads with his daughter to wake up. The toy monkey begins to play by itself and Evelia resurrects to Margarito's delight. A father's love has prevailed over the presumptuous eternity of death; a miracle has taken place in Rome.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cast ==\u000aFrank Ramírez as Margarito Duarte\u000aGerardo Arellano as Antonio, the tenor\u000aAmalia Duque García as Evelia\u000aSantiago García as Bishop of Armenia\u000aHumberto Dorado as the town's priest\u000aLisandro Duque Naranjo as Colombian Embassy's secretary\u000aEnrique Buenaventura as Cardinal Frances\u000aDaniel Priolett as the false Bishop\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production ==\u000aMilagro en Roma was conceived as one of a series of six films born out of Colombian novelist Gabriel García Márquez's interest in Cinema. García Márquez wrote the outlines of the scripts and the making of the films was given to directors from Ibero-America. The films were grouped under the name Amores Dificiles (Tough Loves) and are formed by: Yo soy el que tú buscas (Spain, directed by Jaime Chavarri); El verano de la señora Forbes (México, directed by Jaime Humberto Hermosillo); Un domingo feliz (Venezuela, directed by Olegario Becerra). Cartas del parque (Cuba, directed by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea); Fábula de la bella palomera (Brasil, directed by Ruy Guerra, and the Colombian film, Milagro en Roma.\u000aMilagro en Roma was directed by Lisandro Duque and produced by Spanish TV SA and International Network Group under the auspices of the Foundation of New Latin American Cinema as the other films of the Amores Dificiles series. Gabriel García Márquez had been very favorable impressed by Colombian film director Lisandro Duques after watching his film Visa U.S.A (1986) and, based on this, the famous novelist invited Duque to worked with him on the script of Milagro en Roma and to direct the film.\u000aThe story of Milagro en Roma was inspired by a newspaper article published by the author in 1981 entitled The long happy life of Margarito Duarte which recounts a more than twenty years fruitless battle of a humble Colombian man to have her daughter canonized at the Vatican. The film differs greatly from the short article and precedes la Santa (The Saint), a short story written by García Márquez afterwards and published in 1992 as part of his collection of short stories titled Doce Cuentos Peregrinos (Strange Pilgrims).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aSchwartz, Ronald.

aVThe Kamie\u0144 Pomorski homeless hostel fire occurred in north-western Poland at 00:30 local time (23:30 UTC) on 13 April 2009. The fire occurred during the night at a three-story homeless hostel in Kamie\u0144 Pomorski (West Pomeranian Voivodeship), a town with a population of 10,000 situated approximately 60 kilometres or 37 miles from the German border. 23 people, including 13 children [1] were pronounced dead, with a further 20 sustaining an injury of some sort. The hostel was completely destroyed and the corpses of many people were charred beyond recognition in a fire that the BBC called "one of the deadliest in living memory". It was Poland's deadliest fire since a fire destroyed a home for the mentally ill in Górna Grupa in 1980 claiming the lives of 55 victims.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Hostel ==\u000aThe hostel, originally a workers' hotel, was previously described as an unsafe building. It was a three-story structure built in the early 1970s. Survivors have reported that this was not the first fire to occur at the hostel.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Incident ==\u000a\u000aAt least seventy-seven people were sheltered in the building while waiting to be provided with alternative housing. Six children were listed as dead, including an eight-month-old infant. One individual was listed as having sustained "serious injuries".\u000aFirefighters were stationed nearby and despite a quick response arrived to find four-fifths of the hostel already in flames with hallways blocked by thick black smoke.\u000aMany of the survivors jumped out of the building, because the available rescue ladders could only reach the first floor. Children were taken from their beds by their parents and hurled through windows as firefighters and onlookers grabbed them and brought them to safety. Common injuries as a result of the fire include burns, smoke inhalation, and fractured bones. Many of the corpses were charred beyond recognition. Some of the casualties were visiting the building and were not necessarily permanently housed there.\u000aImages broadcast on television showed "huge flames reaching high into the sky above the roof" and the "charred, gutted shell" of the hostel. Several hours were spent extinguishing the fire, with twenty-one fire crews on hand to assist.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reaction ==\u000aThree days of national mourning were declared in Poland to begin at midnight following the fire. The country's Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, who was on an Easter holiday like many of the victims, flew to Kamie\u0144 Pomorski, promising new housing and aid for the survivors. The country's President, Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, also made an appearance.\u000aThe President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev sent a letter of condolence to Kaczy\u0144ski. "On behalf of the people of Azerbaijan and on my own behalf, I offer sincere condolences to you and the people of Poland and wish recovery to the injured", said Aliyev.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aList of Poland disasters by death toll\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aV125th Street is an express station that has four tracks and two island platforms. It is the northernmost Manhattan station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at Lexington Avenue and East 125th Street (also known as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) in East Harlem, it is served by the 4 and 6 trains at all times, the 5 train at all times except late nights on weekdays, and the <6> during weekdays in peak direction.\u000aA planned northern extension of the Second Avenue Subway would connect with this station and with the Metro-North Railroad's Harlem\u2013125th Street station, located one block west.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aThis station opened on July 17, 1918 as part of the extension of the original subway up Lexington Avenue to 125th Street and into the Bronx. Initially, service was provided only as a shuttle on the local tracks of the then-formed Lexington Avenue Line between Grand Central, continuing past this station and under the Harlem River to 167th Street on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line. On August 1, 1918, through service on the Lexington Avenue Line began. Both express trains and local trains began stopping at this station, running from Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn. The extension from Grand Central cost $58,000,000.\u000aThe opening of this station resulted in development in the surrounding neighborhood of East Harlem.\u000aIn 1952 or 1953, a public address system was installed at this station, providing information to passengers and train crews.\u000aIn 1981, the MTA listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. This station's renovation was completed in 2005.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Station layout ==\u000a\u000aThe station is unusual in design, as a bi-level station with island platforms but not configured in the standard express-local lower-upper configuration. Instead, the upper platform serves northbound (uptown) trains and the lower level serves southbound (downtown) trains. Adding to the unusual design is the local track on each level having train doors open to the right; the express tracks likewise have doors opening to the left. North of the station, just after crossing the Harlem River, the line splits into the IRT Jerome Avenue Line (heading north) and the IRT Pelham Line (heading east). On the lower platform, each track comes from one line, and a flying junction south of the station allows trains to be diverted to the local or express track. Throughout the station's history, this station has been one of the more important on the line as it is the northernmost transfer point between express trains to the IRT Jerome Avenue and White Plains Road Lines, and local trains to the IRT Pelham Line.\u000aThere is an active tower at the north end of the upper platform; it is a satellite to the tower at Grand Central\u201342nd Street, which controls the entire length of the Lexington Avenue Line.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Exits ===\u000aThere are four staircase exits and one elevator exit.\u000aEntrance 2: Staircase at SW corner of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street\u000aEntrance 3: Staircase at SE corner of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street\u000a Entrance 4: Staircase and elevator at NE corner of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street\u000aEntrance 5: Staircase at NW corner of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street\u000aThis station has a mezzanine with two separate turnstile banks. The northern turnstile bank leads to two staircases going to both northern corners of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street, and an elevator going to the NE corner of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street. The southern turnstile bank has two exits leading to both southern corners of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street.\u000aThe station lies one block east of the Metro-North Railroad's Harlem\u2013125th Street station on Park Avenue.\u000aEntrance 1 does not currently exist, but will be built as part of a proposed Second Avenue Subway station here. It would be located at the southeast corner of 125th Street and Park Avenue, as would an ancillary facility on that site. An ancillary would also be built at the southeast corner of 125th Street and Third Avenue.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Planned Second Avenue Subway station ==\u000aThe planned northern terminal for the Second Avenue Subway would be built below, perpendicular to the existing station along 125th Street. The 125th Street station would be part of Phase 2, from 96th Street to 125th Street, with the next station south being 116th Street. Phase 2 would also include a station at 106th Street. A station at Lexington Avenue and 125th Street was not on the original Second Avenue Subway proposed as part of the New York City Transit Authority's 1968 Program for Action; instead, a Second Avenue Subway station would be built at 126th Street and Second Avenue. The line was to be built in two phases\u2014the first phase from 126th to 34th Streets, the second phase from 34th to Whitehall Streets. When opened, it will initially be served by the Q train, with the T providing service when phase 3 of the line is built.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Introduction of the station to plans ===\u000aIn March 2007, the Second Avenue Subway was revived. The line's first phase, the "first major expansion" to the New York City Subway in more than a half-century, included three stations in total and cost $4.45 to $4.5 billion. spanning from 105th Street and Second Avenue to 63rd Street and Third Avenue. Phase 1 opened on January 1, 2017.\u000aThe second phase, between 125th and 96th Streets, was allocated $525 million in the MTA's 2015\u20132019 Capital Plan for planning, design, environmental studies, and utility relocation. This phase will complete the project's East Harlem section. The alignment will run under Second Avenue to 124th Street, before turning west on 125th Street. On October 18, 2016, the de Blasio administration announced a rezoning plan for East Harlem. One of the three Special Transit Land Use (TA) districts is for the area of the 125th Street/Lexington Avenue station.\u000aOn November 21, 2016, the MTA requested that the Phase 2 project be entered into the Project Development phase under the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program. On December 15, several elected officials for the area announced that they were seeking $6 billion of funding for Phase 2 of the line, including $2 billion from the federal government. These officials wished to secure funding from the presidential administration of Barack Obama before Obama's term ended on January 20, 2017. In their request for funding, they cited that they wanted to avoid an uncertain response from the administration of Donald Trump and start construction on Phase 2 as soon as possible. The FTA granted this request in late December 2016. Under the approved plan, the MTA would complete an environmental reevaluation by 2018, receive funding by 2020, and open Phase 2 between 2027 and 2029. In January 2017, it was announced that Phases 2 and 3, which are expected to cost up to a combined $14.2 billion, were on the Trump administration's priority list of 50 most important transportation projects nationwide.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Current plans ===\u000aWhen built, this platform will be the permanent northern terminal of the Second Avenue Subway. It will be five levels below street level, or two levels below the lower-level IRT Lexington Avenue Line platform. The station will have a three-track, two-island platform layout with a mezzanine above it. There will be railroad switches to the east of the platforms to switch the direction of terminating trains. The station will also include a new exit leading directly from the Second Avenue Line platform to the south side of Park Avenue and 125th Street, allowing for a quick connection to the Metro-North station. The tracks will continue west of the station to midblock between Fifth Avenue and Lenox Avenue, creating space for tail tracks to store trains and providing a provision for a future expansion of the line along 125th Street.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Second Avenue Subway Community Information Center ===\u000aA Second Avenue Subway Community Information Center for Phase 2, along 125th Street between Park and Madison Avenues, was originally planned to open in May 2017. The center's opening was delayed to September 18, 2017.\u000a\u000a\u000a== In popular culture ==\u000aThe location is referenced in The Velvet Underground song "Waiting for the Man", in which the song's protagonist uses the train station en route to buy heroin in Harlem: "Up to Lexington, 1-2-5 / Feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aLee Stokey.

aVFrankie Avalon (born Francis Thomas Avallone; September 18, 1940) is an Italian-American actor, singer, and former teen idol.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life and career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Early life and music ===\u000aAvalon was born in Philadelphia, the son of Mary and Nicholas Avallone.\u000aIn December 1952, he made his American network television debut playing the trumpet in the Honeymooners "Christmas Party" sketch on The Jackie Gleason Show. Two singles showcasing Avalon's trumpet playing were issued on RCA Victor's "X" sublabel in 1954. His trumpet playing was also featured on some of his LP songs as well. As a teenager he played with Bobby Rydell in Rocco and the Saints.\u000aIn 1959, "Venus" (5 weeks #1) and "Why" went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. "Why" was the last #1 of the 1950s.\u000aAvalon had 31 charted U.S. Billboard singles from 1958 to late 1962, including "Just Ask Your Heart" (U.S. #7), "I'll Wait for You" (U.S. #15), "Bobby Sox to Stockings" (U.S. #8), and "A Boy Without a Girl" (U.S. #10). Most of his hits were written and/or produced by Bob Marcucci, head of Chancellor Records. He was less popular in the U.K., but did still manage four chart hits with "Why", "Ginger Bread", "Venus" and "Don't Throw Away All Those Teardrops".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Film and TV career ===\u000a\u000aAvalon's first film was a short appearance in Jamboree (1957), playing a trumpet and singing "Teacher's Pet".\u000aIn the late 1950s, teen idols were often given roles in films, supporting older male stars in order to attract a younger audience, such as Ricky Nelson in Rio Bravo (1959). Avalon was a favourite of the daughter of Alan Ladd who recommended him to co-star with her father in the Western Guns of the Timberland (1960). Avalon sings two songs, "The Faithful Kind" and "Gee Whiz Whillikins Golly Gee"; both were released as singles.\u000aLadd announced he would reteam Avalon and his daughter in Six Steps to Freedom but the film was never made.\u000aRushes for Timberland were seen by John Wayne, who was looking for a young actor to play the (fictitious) role of "Smitty" in his passion project, The Alamo (1960). Avalon was cast in his second dramatic part. After making the film Wayne told the press "We're not cutting one bit of any scene in which Frankie appears. I believe he is the finest young talent I've seen in a long time." "Mr Wayne said I was natural as far as acting goes," said Avalon. He added, "My ambition when I was ten years old was to have my own band like Harry James. I never expected anything like this... I'd like to be identified as a singer, dancer and actor. I don't want to be just one thing."\u000a"I like to appeal to teenagers and adults," he said in 1960. "Everybody".\u000aAvalon was now in demand as an actor. He provided the singing voice for the lead character in the English language version of a Japanese musical anime, Alakazam the Great (1960), which was done at the behest of the US distributor, American International Pictures - the first in what would be a long association with that company.\u000aFor Irwin Allen he had a small role and sang the title role in the science fiction adventure film, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961), a solid hit. He had a support role in a comedy, Sail a Crooked Ship (1961).\u000a\u000a\u000a=== AIP Association ===\u000aAvalon was teamed with Ray Milland in the science fiction film, Panic in Year Zero! (1962), written by Lou Rusoff. Samuel Z. Arkoff of American International Pictures (AIP) said Avalon and Milland were teamed together because "they both have particular types of followers and the combination adds up to an attraction."\u000aFor AIP he made a war movie with Tab Hunter, Operation Bikini (1963), singing a few songs in flashback. At MGM he played the lead in an adventure film set in Africa, Drums of Africa (1963).\u000aOf more significance for Avalon's career was a project originally written by Rusoff, Beach Party (1963). This cheerful musical comedy starred Annette Funicello and was directed by William Asher; Arkoff said AIP originally wanted Fabian Forte to co-star with Funicello, but when he proved unavailable they went with Avalon. It was a big hit and led to several sequels.\u000aHe received an offer to appear in a swashbuckler set in 10th century Spain about Fernán González of Castile, The Castilian (1963), then was in the first Beach Party sequel, Muscle Beach Party (1963). It was popular; even more so was Bikini Beach (1964), where Avalon had a dual role. In August 1964 Avalon announced he signed to make ten films in five years for AIP.\u000aPajama Party (1964) was unofficially the fourth in the series; it was a science fiction spoof, Avalon ceded leading man duties to Tommy Kirk, but he had a cameo. He was back as leading man in Beach Blanket Bingo (1965). Avalon later recalled, "'That's the picture of mine that I think people remember best, and it was just a lot of kids having a lot of fun -- a picture about young romance and about the opposition of adults and old people... It was also fun because we got to learn how to fake skydive out of an airplane."\u000aAvalon appeared in nearly two dozen TV episodes, including ABC's The Bing Crosby Show and The Patty Duke Show, appearing often as himself. Later, he became a national television spokesperson for Sonic Drive-In. In 1965 he appeared in the Combat! episode "Brother, Brother" as a childhood friend of Pfc.Kirby, played by Jack Hogan.\u000aHe and Tuesday Weld supported Bob Hope in a comedy, I'll Take Sweden (1965) for Edward Small. For AIP he teamed with Dwayne Hickman in a rip off of Some Like It Hot (1959), Ski Party (1965). That studio gave him the lead in a service comedy, Sergeant Deadhead (1965), playing another dual role. All this activity meant he was reluctant to appear in another "beach party" movie, so he let Hickman play the lead in How to Stuff a Wild Bikini (1965), although Avalon had a cameo.\u000aThe box office performance of these last few films were disappointing - especially Sergeant Deadhead, for which sequels had been planned. More popular was Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine (1965), a comedy with Vincent Price and Hickman, for AIP. This was liked enough to justify a sequel, although Avalon did not appear, Fabian Forte taking over.\u000aAIP tried to find a new formula for Avalon, and cast him as a stock car driver in Fireball 500 (1966), alongside Fabian and Funicello, for director William Asher. It was a medium success, and led to other AIP stock car movies, though none with Avalon.\u000aFor Harry Alan Towers he played the lead in The Million Eyes of Sumuru (1967), and had a good part in Skidoo (1968), a comedy from Otto Preminger. In England he was in The Haunted House of Horror (1968) for AIP.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1970s and 1980s ===\u000aIn 1976, Avalon updated his song "Venus" with a new disco treatment.\u000aMaterializing as a character called Teen Angel, his performance of "Beauty School Dropout" in the hit 1978 film of the musical Grease introduced Avalon to a new generation of viewers.\u000aThe 1980 film The Idolmaker, written by Ed Di Lorenzo and directed by Taylor Hackford, was a thinly-disguised biography of Avalon ("Tommy Dee" in the film) as well as 1950s teenage star Fabian Forte (called "Caesare" in the film), along with songwriter/producer Bob Marcucci (called "Vinnie Vacarri"). In the film, Dee clashes with the record producer and younger singer Caesare, who he feels threatens his career. Eventually, Dee and Caesare quit the label, but their record careers collapse just as the British Invasion begins. The real Fabian threatened a lawsuit, despite the filmmakers' insistence that the film presented only fictional characters (though Marcucci was a paid consultant). Avalon denied most of the film's events.\u000aAvalon had the idea of returning to beach party films with Funicello. He hired several screenwriters and shopped the screenplay around town, eventually managing to set up the project at Paramount Pictures. Back to the Beach (1987) was a moderate success. \u000aIn 1989 Avalon and Funicello appeared as themselves in cameo roles out jogging the streets in Troop Beverly Hills. Not long afterwards, Funicello was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and retired.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Later career ===\u000aAfterwards, Avalon turned to marketing and created Frankie Avalon Products, a line of health and cosmetic aids. Avalon promotes his products on the Home Shopping Network with host Bob Circosta.\u000aHe made a cameo appearance as himself with Robert De Niro in the 1995 film, Casino.\u000aIn recent years, Avalon has starred in stage productions of Grease in the role of Teen Angel and Tony n' Tina's Wedding as a caricature of himself. Additionally, in 2007, he performed "Beauty School Dropout" with the four remaining female contenders (Kathleen Monteleone, Allie Schulz, Ashley Spencer, and winner Laura Osnes) for the role of Sandy on the NBC television reality show Grease: You're the One that I Want!\u000aOn April 8, 2009, he performed on American Idol.\u000aAs part of a long-running concert tour, Avalon has toured with fellow Philadelphian 50s teen idols Fabian and Bobby Rydell under the banner "Dick Fox's Golden Boys."\u000aA cookbook with over 80 recipes from St. Martin's Press, Frankie Avalon's Italian Family Cookbook, was published in 2015.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aAvalon married Kathryn "Kay" Diebel on January 19, 1963. She was a former beauty pageant winner, and Avalon met her while playing cards at a friend's house. He told his friend that Kay was the girl he was going to marry. His agent warned Avalon that marriage would spoil his teen idol mystique. They have eight children \u2013 Frankie Jr., Tony, Dina, Laura, Joseph, Nicolas, Kathryn and Carla. They have 10 grandchildren. Frankie Avalon Jr. is a former actor who appeared in the original The Karate Kid and is now a musician, and Tony, the second oldest son, plays guitar and taught at the Rock Nation School. Both sons play on tour with their father.\u000aIn 1963, Avalon had to fight a paternity suit.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Legacy ==\u000a\u000aHe was mentioned in the System of a Down song "Old School Hollywood". The song supposedly is about Daron Malakian's experience in a celebrity baseball game, where he and Avalon were both ignored.\u000aAvalon is also mentioned in "It Takes Two", a song from the hit musical Hairspray, sung by the character Link Larkin, and in a song by the Wu-Tang Clan called "The City" which refers to his experiences of being a big part of the beach party film genre ("Ride the wave like Frankie Avalon").\u000aOne of numerous obscure cultural references present in Midway's video game Mortal Kombat 3 was a lo-res image of Frankie Avalon's face that would dart up in the lower right-hand corner of the screen when Goro killed his opponent by knocking him into the spike pit on the Bridge level.\u000aHis song "Venus" was featured in Cranium Command (1989\u20132005), an attraction at Epcot's Wonders of Life Pavilion (now closed) at Walt Disney World. In the attraction, a 12-year-old boy named Bobby (Scott Curtis), tries to survive the pressures of life and falls in love with a beautiful girl named Annie (Natalie Gregory) at school.\u000a\u000aAvalon and his song "Venus" are mentioned in Wendy Wasserstein's 2005 play Third. The main character, English professor Laurie Jameson, watches a PBS reunion show featuring Avalon singing the song, and sings a line of it to her daughter. In stage productions of the show, part of the song is played and a portion of the supposed PBS special is screened as part of the scenery.\u000aHe is also referenced in the 1994 film, The Stöned Age, in which he makes an ending scene cameo appearance.\u000aHis song "Venus" additionally appeared in season 4 of the TV series Dexter in which John Lithgow's character, Arthur Mitchell, plays it to remember his deceased sister. Also, "Venus" is sampled in Nick Bertke's, single, "J'Adore Juin", a mashup of sounds from the movie The Apartment. "Venus" also appeared in the 2016 film Cloverfield starring John Goodman.\u000aAvalon is also mentioned in The Vaccines' song Teenage Icon.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Acting roles ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a\u000aOfficial website\u000aFrankie Avalon on IMDb\u000aFrankie Avalon at AllMovie\u000aFrankie Avalon images, from Google image search\u000aFrankie Avalon at AllMusic.com\u000aFilm Reference bio\u000aJune 8, 1961 appearance on You Bet Your Life

aVThe Northern Forest Canoe Trail (NFCT) is a 740-mile (1,190 km) marked canoeing trail in the northeastern United States and Canada, extending from Old Forge in the Adirondacks of New York to Fort Kent, Maine. Along the way, the trail also passes through the states and provinces of Vermont, Quebec, and New Hampshire. The trail was opened on June 3, 2006.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Overview ==\u000a\u000aThe trail has been likened to a water version of the Appalachian Trail, and there are many similarities: both are long-distance trails that most people will use for day trips or short overnight trips. Many of those who paddle the entire trail will do so in sections. Unlike the AT, the NFCT obtains access for campsites and portages through landowner permission rather than through land protection. Also, many sections of the trail require a high level of skill to complete.\u000aThe trail is divided into 13 sections: Adirondack Country (West) New York, Adirondack North Country (Central) New York, Adirondack Country (East) New York, Islands and Farms Region Vermont, Upper Missisquoi Valley Vermont/Quebec, Northeast Kingdom Quebec/Vermont, Great North Woods New Hampshire, Rangeley Lakes Region Maine, Flagstaff Region Maine, Greater Jackman Region Maine, Moosehead/Penobscot Region Maine, Allagash Region (South) Maine, and Allagash Region (North) Maine. Each of these sections has been mapped and documented in order to establish the trail.\u000aTrail towns include Old Forge, Richford, Vermont, The Errol-Berlin Corridor, New Hampshire and Rangeley, Maine. In Maine it primarily traverses through the North Maine Woods region\u000aThe trail covers 58 lakes and ponds, 22 rivers and streams, and 63 "carries" (portages) totaling 53 miles (85 km). On some sections of the trail, portage trails, campsites, and access areas are marked with Northern Forest Canoe Trail medallions, a yellow diamond with blue lettering.\u000aThe American Canoe Association has named the NFCT an ACA-Recommended Water Trail.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bodies of Water ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== New York (147 mi.) ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Vermont & Québec (174 mi.) ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== New Hampshire (72 mi.) ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Maine (374 mi.) ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Through-paddlers ==\u000aAs of 2014, 68 people have "through-paddled" the trail \u2014 traveling the length of the trail in one expedition. In addition, three others have completed it in multiple trips.\u000aNicole Grohoski and Thomas Perkins of Ellsworth, Maine were the first to officially through-paddle the trail in 2006, traveling the length of the trail in about 45 days. Donnie Mullen paddled the trail in 2000 before its official opening, taking about 55 days but doing so without the signs and maps that were available in 2015. The fastest thru-paddle was completed in 2012 Elspeth Ronnander, Erik Peih and Emily Johnson. the trip took them 21 days, 3 hours and 45 minutes.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Northern Forest Canoe Trail literature ==\u000a"Paddling the Northern Forest Canoe Trail" by Sam Brakeley - a narrative of a 2009 thru-paddle in journal form.\u000a"The Northern Forest Canoe Trail Through-Paddler's Companion" by Katina Daanen, a guide book to paddling the 740-mile (1,190 km) water trail from its western terminus in Old Forge, New York to the eastern terminus in Fort Kent, Maine.\u000a"Paddling Through Time - The Story of the Northern Forest Canoe Trail", Northern Forest Canoe Trail, 2006.

aVChandos Records is a British independent classical music recording company based in Colchester. It was founded in 1979 by Brian Couzens.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Background ==\u000aChandos Records arose from a band music publisher Chandos Music, founded in 1963, and Chandos Productions, a record production company which produced LPs for Classics for Pleasure, and, especially, RCA's work in the UK. Its first record was Bloch's Sacred Service (ABR1001). Important early recordings were made with Mariss Jansons, Nigel Kennedy and the King's Singers \u2013 before they moved to bigger contracts with EMI.\u000aIn 2005, Chandos Records was the first classical label to offer mp3s on its website. They now run The Classical Shop with over 45 labels on offer, including Naxos, LSO Live, Coro, Avie, Onyx, Alpha and many rarer European labels, which are not available in physical format in the UK.\u000aThe current managing director of Chandos Records is Ralph Couzens, son of Brian Couzens.\u000aThe name "Chandos" refers to James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos (1674-1744), at whose Palladian-style house, Cannons, Handel was engaged as a composer-in-residence for approximately a year (1717-1718). In addition to the eleven "Chandos" anthems, Handel also wrote other works, including Acis and Galatea, at Cannons. The company originally had its office in Chandos House, Chandos Place, London SW1, the street name derived from the Duke.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Repertoire ==\u000aThe Chandos catalogue contains a range of classical music - for example, much orchestral, choral and chamber music by such lesser-known British composers as Herbert Howells, Gerald Finzi, Charles Villiers Stanford and Arnold Bax, conducted by eminent conductors including Richard Hickox, Gianandrea Noseda, Neeme Järvi and Vernon Handley. They also specialise in early music, on their label Chaconne, with performances by artists such as the Purcell Quartet, Collegium Musicum 90 and Sophie Yates. Chandos is also known for its Movies series, preserving previously lost film scores. In 1990 they launched the Opera in English label, in association with the Peter Moores Foundation, which has resulted in over 80 recordings.\u000aSeries include:\u000aComplete symphonies of Alwyn, Vaughan Williams, Mahler, Arnold, Shostakovich, Bax\u000aTone poems of Liszt\u000aFilm Music series includes: Arnold, Shostakovich, Vaughan Willams, Bax, Korngold, Coates, Addinsell, Addison\u000a\u000a\u000a== Awards ==\u000aRecordings released by Chandos have won many awards including "Gramophone Record of the Year" for Vaughan Williams's A London Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra, and "Gramophone Choral Recording of the Year" for Hummel Masses. Chandos recordings have received five Grammy Awards: "Best Opera Recording" in 1997 for Britten's Peter Grimes and in 2008 for Engelbert Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel, "Best Engineered Classical Album" in 2008 for Gretchaninov's "Passion Week" and in 2013 for "Life and Breath" by the Kansas City Chorale, and "Best Choral Performance" for "Life and Breath."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Artists ==\u000aSoloists and conductors who have recorded for the label include Sir Charles Mackerras, Rebecca Evans, Julian Lloyd Webber, Sir Thomas Allen, Alan Opie, Tasmin Little, Bruce Ford, Barry Banks, Christine Brewer, Lesley Garrett, Horacio Gutiérrez, Neeme Järvi, Simon Keenlyside, Hideko Udagawa and Alexandre Naoumenko.\u000aThey have an exclusive recording partnership with, among others, the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra and pianist Jean-Efflam Bavouzet.

aVLabeoninae is a doubtfully distinct subfamily of ray-finned fishes in the family Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes. They inhabit fresh water and the largest species richness is in the region around southern China, but there are also species elsewhere in Asia, and some members of Garra and Labeo are from Africa. They are a generally very apomorphic group, perhaps the most "advanced" of the Cyprinidae. A common name for these fishes is labeonins (when considered a distinct subfamily) or labeoins (when included in subfamily Cyprininae).\u000aThey include the group sometimes separated as Garrinae, but these do not seem to be that distinct. In fact, the entire Labeoninae is merged into the Cyprininae by a number of authors; in any case, these two and the former "Barbinae" form a close-knit group whose internal phylogeny is far from resolved. If the subfamily is considered distinct, it is typically split in the tribes Labeonini (which are able to swim well in open water) and Garrini (which are mostly benthic), and sometimes in addition the Banganini (which are somewhat intermediate in habitus) If the labeo lineage is included in the Cyprininae, it becomes the tribe Labeonini, while its two (or three) subdivisions are the subtribes Labeoina, Garraina and perhaps Banganina.\u000aNotable genera are Crossocheilus, Epalzeorhynchos and Garra, which contain some of the popular aquarium fishes often called "algae eaters", e.g. the Siamese algae-eater (Crossocheilus siamensis). Labeo \u2013 the type genus of this subfamily \u2013 contains many sizeable species which are often used as food.\u000aAnatomically, the labeonins are distinguished by the Weberian apparatus contacting the skull with the supraneural bones, and its basioccipital process being concave in cross-section. The first vertebra has a parapophysis that is elongated to forward and partially overlaps the basioccipital process. The fourth vertebra, meanwhile, has a short but stout transverse process that is prominently elongated bellywards; the os suspensorium is often hidden behind if viewed from the side. In the skull, the frontal and sphenotic bones have prominent foramina. In the anal fin, the first pterygiophore is elongated and has well-developed anterior and posterior flanges, with the former very large and concave at the distal end. Most labeonins have the skinny flap of the underside of the snout well-developed into a fleshy cap that at least partially hides the upper lip except when feeding, and a similar structure at the lower lip.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Genera ==\u000a\u000aThe supposed genus "Tylognathus", commonly placed in the Labeonini (or Labeoina), is actually a polyphyletic assemblage containing diverse labeonins and some other cyprinids. Its type species, variously called "Tylognathus diplostoma" or "Tylognathus valenciennesii", is actually Bangana diplostoma; most of its other species are now in Lobocheilos.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Footnotes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000ade Graaf, Martin; Megens, Hendrik-Jan; Samallo, Johannis & Sibbing, Ferdinand A.

aVAtlas Express v Kafco (Importers & Distributors) Ltd [1989] QB 833 is an English contract law case relating to duress.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Facts ==\u000aKafco Ltd had a contract to supply Woolworths with baskets. They had a \u2018trading agreement\u2019 with Atlas Express for at least six months to do the deliveries. Atlas Express realised it had underestimated the size of cartons to be carried. So it was costing more to deliver. Kafco would not vary the price. Atlas sent an empty truck to Kafco, with a letter saying if a higher charge was not agreed to, the truck would leave empty. Kafco would go broke without the contract, so they signed. Later, Kafco refused to pay, and argued there was economic duress, and also no new consideration.\u000aKafco also successfully argued that Atlas had given no consideration for its promise to pay more money on the basis that Atlas was merely performing an existing contractual duty (Stilk v Myrick (1809) 2 Camp 317)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Judgment ==\u000aTucker J held there was economic duress in this situation, which meant the contract was voidable. When Kafco\u2019s Mr Armiger signed, he did so \u2018unwillingly and under compulsion (...) He had no bargaining power. He did not regard it as a genuine arm\u2019s length re-negotiation in which he had a free and equal say and, in my judgement, that view was fully justified.\u2019 He distinguished economic duress from \u2018commercial pressure, which on any view is not sufficient to vitiate consent. The borderline between the two may in some cases be indistinct.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aEnglish contract law\u000aLloyds Bank Ltd v Bundy [1975] QB 326\u000aWilliams v.

aVRaymond Arthur Palmer (August 1, 1910 \u2013 August 15, 1977) was an American editor of Amazing Stories from 1938 through 1949, when he left publisher Ziff-Davis to publish and edit Fate Magazine, and eventually many other magazines and books through his own publishing houses, including Amherst Press and Palmer Publications. In addition to magazines such as Mystic, Search, and 'Flying Saucers," he published numerous spirtualist books, including Oahspe: A New Bible, as well as several books related to flying saucers, including "The Coming of the Saucers," co-written by Palmer with Kenneth Arnold. Palmer was also a prolific author of science fiction and fantasy stories, many of which were published under pseudonyms.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aAccording to Bruce Lanier Wright, "Palmer was hit by a truck at age seven and suffered a broken back." An unsuccessful operation on Palmer's spine stunted his growth (he stood about four feet tall), and left him with a hunchback.\u000aPalmer found refuge in science fiction, which he read voraciously. He rose through the ranks of science fiction fandom and is credited, along with Walter Dennis, with editing the first fanzine, The Comet, in May, 1930.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aThroughout the 1930's, Palmer would have many of his stories published in several science fiction magazines of the era. When Ziff-Davis acquired Amazing Stories in 1938, editor T. O'Conor Sloane resigned and production was moved to Chicago. On the recommendation of popular author Ralph Milne Farley, the editorship was offered to Palmer. In 1939, Palmer began a companion magazine to Amazing Stories titled Fantastic Adventures, which lasted until 1953.\u000aWhen Ziff-Davis moved its magazine production from Chicago to New York City in 1949, Palmer resigned and, with Curtis Fuller, another Ziff-Davis editor who did not want to leave the midwest, founded Clark Publishing Co.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Science fiction magazines ===\u000a\u000aAs an editor, Palmer tended to favor adventurous, fast-moving space opera-type stories. His tenure at Amazing Stories was notable for his purchase of Isaac Asimov's first professional story, "Marooned Off Vesta".\u000aPalmer was also known for his support of the long running and controversial Shaver Mystery stories, a series of stories by Richard Sharpe Shaver. Palmer's support of the truth of Shaver's stories (which maintained that the world is dominated by insane inhabitants of the hollow earth), was controversial in the science fiction community. It is unclear whether Palmer believed the Shaver stories to be true, or if he was just using the stories to sell magazines. Palmer asked other writers to do stories in the Shaver genre, the most notable being Rog Phillips.\u000aPalmer began his own science fiction publishing ventures while working for Ziff-Davis, eventually leaving the company to form his own publishing house, Clark Publishing Company, which was responsible for the titles Imagination and Other Worlds, among others. None of these magazines achieved the success of Amazing Stories during the Palmer years, but Palmer published Space World magazine until his death.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Paranormality magazines ===\u000aIn 1948, Palmer and Curtis Fuller co-founded Fate, which covered divination methods, Fortean events, belief in the survival of personality after death, predictive dreams, accounts of ghosts, mental telepathy, archaeology, flying saucer sightings, cryptozoology, alternative medicine, warnings of death, and other paranormal topics, many contributed by readers.\u000aCurtis Fuller and his wife Mary took full control of Fate in 1955, when Palmer sold his interest in the venture. The magazine has continued in publication under a series of editors and publishers to the present day.\u000aAnother paranormal magazine Palmer created along the line of Fate was Mystic magazine, which after about two years of publication became Search magazine.\u000aIn the 1970s, Palmer also published Ray Palmer's News Letter which was combined into another of his publications called Forum in March 1975.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== UFO magazine ===\u000aIn the first issue of Fate, Palmer published Kenneth Arnold's report of "flying discs." Arnold's sighting marked the beginning of the modern UFO era, and his story propelled the fledgling Fate to national recognition. Through Fate, Palmer was instrumental in popularizing belief in flying saucers. This interest led him to establish the magazine Flying Saucers.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Spiritual publications ===\u000aPalmer's avid interest in spirituality and alternative explanations of reality was reflected in his choice of publications. His interest in the Oahspe Bible, led him on a 15-year search for a copy of the original 1882 edition published by Oahspe Publishing Assoc., New York and London. Although a later edited and revised edition was published in 1891 and reprinted over the years, the original 1882 Oahspe Bible was not available until Palmer republished a facsimile of it in 1960. It is often referred to as "The Palmer Edition" or "The Green Oahspe" among Oahspe readers. He continued to publish and reprint later editions to which he added an index and editor's notes. Oahspe was reported by the spiritualist medium John B. Newbrough to have come as automatic writing through his hands on the newly invented typewriter.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Tributes ==\u000aThe secret identity of DC Comics superhero the Atom - introduced by science fiction writer Gardner Fox in 1961 - is named after Palmer.\u000aA newer edition of Oahspe as a tribute edition to Ray Palmer was published in 2009 titled: Oahspe - Raymond A. Palmer Tribute Edition.\u000aIn September 2013, Palmer was posthumously named to the First Fandom Hall of Fame in a ceremony at the 71st World Science Fiction Convention.\u000aIn 2013, Tarcher/Penguin published a biography of Palmer called The Man From Mars and written by Fred Nadis.\u000aPalmer is also the subject of Richard Toronto's 2013 book, War over Lemuria: Richard Shaver, Ray Palmer and the Strangest Chapter of 1940s Science Fiction, which attempts to give a detailed history of the Shaver Mystery and it's two main proponents.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Short stories ===\u000aThe Time Ray of Jandra, Wonder Stories (June 1930)\u000aThe Man Who Invaded Time, Science Fiction Digest (October 1932)\u000aEscape from Antarctica, Science Fiction Digest (June 1933)\u000aThe Girl from Venus, Science Fiction Digest (September 1933)\u000aThe Return to Venus, Fantasy Magazine (May 1934)\u000aThe Vortex World, Fantasy Magazine (1934)\u000aThe Time Tragedy, Wonder Stories (December 1934)\u000aThree from the Test-Tube, Wonder Stories (1935)\u000aThe Symphony of Death, Amazing Stories (December 1935)\u000aMatter Is Conserved, Astounding Science-Fiction (April 1938)\u000aCatalyst Planet, Thrilling Wonder Stories (August 1938)\u000aThe Blinding Ray, Amazing Stories (August 1938)\u000aOutlaw of Space, Amazing Stories (August 1938)\u000aBlack World (Part 1 of 2), Amazing Stories (March 1940)\u000aBlack World (Part 2 of 2), Amazing Stories (April 1940)\u000aThe Vengeance of Martin Brand (Part 1 of 2), Amazing Stories (August 1942)\u000aThe Vengeance of Martin Brand (Part 2 of 2), Amazing Stories (September 1942)\u000aKing of the Dinosaurs, Fantastic Adventures (October 1945)\u000aToka and the Man Bats, Fantastic Adventures (February 1946)\u000aToka Fights the Big Cats, Fantastic Adventures (December 1947)\u000aIn the Sphere of Time, Planet Stories (Summer 1948)\u000aThe Justice of Martin Brand, Other Worlds Science Stories (July 1950)\u000aThe Hell Ship, Worlds of If (March 1952)\u000aMr. Yellow Jacket, Other Worlds (June 1951)\u000aI Flew in a Flying Saucer (Part 1 of 2), Other Worlds Science Stories (October 1951)\u000aI Flew in a Flying Saucer (Part 2 of 2), Other Worlds Science Stories (December 1951)\u000aThe Metal Emperor, Imaginative Tales (November 1955)\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Nonfiction ===\u000aThe Coming of the Saucers (with Kenneth Arnold) (1952)\u000aThe Secret World (with Richard Shaver) (1975)\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aCharles Fort\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aWorks by Raymond A.

He was the 12th head of Oroku Dunchi, and his father Oroku Ry\u014dky\u014d, was a Sanshikan during Sh\u014d Iku's reign.\u000aOroku Ry\u014dch\u016b was selected as a member of Sanshikan in 1857. He was pro-Japanese, and was a political ally of Makishi Ch\u014dch\u016b and Onga Ch\u014dk\u014d (\u6069\u6cb3 \u671d\u6052, also known as Sh\u014d Jorin \u5411 \u6c5d\u9716). The election of Sanshikan would be held in 1859, Oroku helped Makishi Ch\u014dch\u016b to offer a bribe to two Japanese samurai, Ichiki Shir\u014d and Sonoda Niemon (\u5712\u7530 \u4ec1\u53f3\u885b\u9580), in order to let Makishi be elected. However, Zakimi Seifu, a former Sanshikan whom was impeached by Onga Ch\u014dk\u014d and had to resign before, accused Makishi Ch\u014dch\u016b of practice bribery at election. Soon Oroku's unlawful act was exposed, he was removed from his position and arrested together with Makishi Ch\u014dch\u016b and Onga Ch\u014dk\u014d. Prince Ie was appointed as judge to interrogate them. Oroku denied all the allegations but Makishi pleaded guilty. Oroku was exiled to Ie Island and imprisoned at a temple for 500 days, while Makishi was sentenced to exile to Yaeyama for ten years and Onga to Kume Island for six years, respectively. This incident was known as Makishi Onga Incident (\u7267\u5fd7\u6069\u6cb3\u4e8b\u4ef6).\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVFranklyn Marks (May 31, 1911, Cleveland, Ohio - July 12, 1976, Sherman Oaks, California) was an American composer and arranger, who worked principally in the idioms of film soundtracks and jazz.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aEarly in his career, Marks wrote the song Merry Widow on a Spree for Irving Mills (1937, as Frank Marks), which he also recorded as a pianist with the Millphonics Orchestra. In the same year he played more of his compositions with his own band. In the next few years, he arranged for Charlie Barnet and was involved in the orchestration of the musicals Too Many Girls and Best Foot Forward.\u000aStarting in 1950, Marks wrote compositions for the Stan Kenton orchestra that were oriented towards Latin jazz. His Trajectories were played by Kenton to open his concerts. Kenton also recorded his works Spirals and Evening in Pakistan. Songs by Marks were also recorded by Jerry Lewis, Mel Blanc, Ike Carpenter, Bob Crosby, Laurindo Almeida and Artie Shaw. In 1953 he accompanied Yma Sumac on the piano at the Mocambo-Club in Hollywood.\u000aConcomitantly, Marks worked as a composer and arranger for Hollywood studios, especially for Walt Disney Studios from 1955. Marks had less compositional freedom as a composer for Hollywood, But unlike in the jazz area, he could earn his living there. As a composer, he played for an episode of the Mickey Mouse Club in 1955, from 1956 for 25 episodes of Disneyland, and other Disney television productions. For the cinema, he first orchestrated the music of cartoon, documentary, and feature films of the Disney studios for Paul J. Smith, George Bruns, and Marvin Hamlisch before writing the music for the first film featuring Scrooge McDuck in 1967. He also wrote single film songs, such as "Climb the Mountain" for William Alwyn's soundtrack to Third Man on the Mountain (1959).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Filmography ==\u000a1956 : How to Have an Accident in the Home\u000a1956 : The Great Locomotive Chase\u000a1956 : Nature's Secrets of Life\u000a1957 : Johnny Tremain\u000a1957 : Perri\u000a1958 : The Light in the Forest\u000a1960 : Pollyanna\u000a1961 : 101 Dalmatians\u000a1961 : The Parent Trap\u000a1961 : Babes in Toyland\u000a1961 : The Absent-Minded Professor\u000a1962 : Bon Voyage!\u000a1963 : Miracle of the White Stallions\u000a1963 : The Sword and the Stone\u000a1967 : Scrooge McDuck and Money\u000a1967 : How the West Was Lost\u000a1967 : Charlie, the Lonesome Cougar\u000a1969 : Guns in the Heather\u000a1970 : King of the Grizzlies\u000a1972 : Justin Morgan Had a Horse\u000a1973 : The World's Greatest Athlete\u000a1974 : The Castaway Cowboy\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVPocket Opera is an opera company based in San Francisco, California which has been presenting operas in English since 1978. The company was founded by Donald Pippin, whose musical career has spanned over six decades. Born in Zebulon, North Carolina and educated at Harvard University, Pippin began his career as an accompanist at George Balanchine's School of American Ballet in New York City.\u000aIn 1952, Pippin moved to San Francisco, and has been an integral part of that city's artistic life since then. Audiences have followed him from his start at the hungry i and Opus One in North Beach, through nearly two decades of presenting a weekly chamber music series (1960-1978) at the Old Spaghetti Factory, to his present-day fame as the creator of one of San Francisco's most popular operatic institutions.\u000aPippin's first translation came in 1968, in the course of preparing Mozart's one-act opera Bastien und Bastienne for performance as part of his chamber music series. The opera, and his singing translation of it, were immediate successes with San Francisco audiences.\u000aFrom that point on, Pippin has dedicated himself to the task of producing literate English versions of both well-loved classics and lesser-known gems of operatic literature. His repertoire has grown to include over 70 translations, many of which have been used by the Washington Opera at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the San Francisco Opera Center, the San Diego Opera, the Juilliard School of Music, and the Aspen Music Festival, among many others.\u000aIn 2005, Dianna Shuster, formerly of American Musical Theater of San Jose, joined Pocket Opera as the Executive Director. Nicolas Aliaga Garcia joined the company as Production Manager in 2009.\u000aPocket Opera presented Pippin's new English translation of the Polish opera The Haunted Manor, funded by the National Endowment of the Arts in April 2009.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial Website\u000aJoshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle on Pocket Opera (April 22, 2002)\u000aReview of Pocket Opera's Rigoletto (July 7, 2006)\u000aDonald Pippin article at SF Classical Voice (April 13, 2010)

aVRaymond Patriarca Jr. (born February 24, 1945), a.k.a. Ray Junior and Junior, is a former gangster from Providence, Rhode Island and the son of Italian-American mob boss Raymond L.S. Patriarca, after whom the Patriarca crime family was named. The crime family has two factions: one in Providence, Rhode Island and the other in Boston, Massachusetts. He was boss of the crime family for six years after the 1984 death of his father.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Crime family ==\u000aIn 1970, Patriarca Senior (also known as Il Patrone) was convicted of murder and conspiracy to commit murder, along with several of his mob family associates. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison but continued to run his crime family while there.\u000aPatriarca Sr. continued to be pursued by law enforcement for the rest of his life, and he was charged numerous times for a variety of crimes until his death in 1984. In 1983, he was charged with the murder of Raymond Curcio, and he was arrested in 1984 for the murder of Robert Candos, whom the mob boss believed was an informant.\u000aIl Patrone died of a heart attack, aged 76, on July 11, 1984, bringing into question the leadership succession of the New England crime family.\u000a\u000a\u000a== New boss ==\u000aAfter the death of Il Patrone, the New England Mafia began a period of slow decline, resulting from both legal prosecution and internal violence. Jerry Angiulo was the family underboss until he was incarcerated, and he attempted to take over as boss despite being in jail. However, the family's top lieutenant Ilario "Larry" Zannino backed Junior for the position. The National Commission approved Junior's ascendancy to leadership with the backing of the Gambino Crime Family, and his position was confirmed. Angiulo was demoted and Zannino was made consigliere.\u000aJunior was considered a weak leader compared to his father. He managed to keep the peace in his crime family due to the support of the Gambino crime family of New York. Zannino was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 1987, and it further weakened Junior's position. With Zannino in jail, William "Wild Guy" Grasso became underboss. Grasso was known for his ruthlessness, and some law enforcement officials believed that he was actually in charge. However, these rumors ended when Grasso was murdered in June 1989 by a Springfield, Massachusetts-area gangster with ties to the Genovese crime family. Nicholas Bianco then took over the family's Providence operations.\u000aOn March 26, 1990, Junior, underboss Bianco, and 20 other family members and associates were indicted on numerous racketeering, extortion, narcotics, gambling, and murder charges. The arrests were described as "the most sweeping attack ever launched on a single organized crime family." One of the most damaging pieces of evidence was a tape recording of a Mafia induction ceremony, at which 13 Mafiosi were present. The FBI was able to match Junior's voice to the tape due to a radio interview in which he participated. Because of this embarrassment, Junior was replaced as boss by Bianco, who maintained a very low profile. However, in 1991, Bianco was sentenced to 11 years in prison, while eight other family members were convicted of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) charges. Bianco died in prison in 1994.\u000aRaymond Patriarca Jr. was sentenced to eight years in prison in 1992 after pleading guilty to racketeering charges. On January 6, 1992, all of the defendants in the RICO trial pleaded guilty and received lengthy sentences and large fines. In 1993, 26 others were indicted and convicted for running a bookmaking operation. Cadillac Frank Salemme took over the family after the trials and moved their base back to Boston. When Junior was released from prison, he eschewed organized crime and went into retirement.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Father and Son ==\u000a\u000aIn 1986, Junior testified before the Judiciary Committee of the Rhode Island House of Representatives during the impeachment of Rhode Island Supreme Court Chief Justice Joseph A. Bevilacqua Sr., a former criminal defense lawyer accused of consorting with organized crime figures. The hearings led to Bevilacqua's resignation.\u000aDuring the hearing, FBI wiretaps were introduced into evidence of a conversation that took place between Il Patrone in the time of 1962\u20131965. According to the FBI logs:\u000a\u000aRay tells Ray Jr. that when he gets married to marry an Italian girl as she will stand by you when you're in trouble, or won't call the police if you slap her in the mouth.\u000a\u000aAfter testifying, Junior defended his father before the press:\u000a\u000aMy father never, never, never told me about hitting women, Italian women, bothering women. I want to apologize to all the people in the state of Rhode Island because my father...never had a conversation with me like that about women, marrying an Italian girl so you can hit an Italian girl. He never spoke to me like that. In fact, my first wife was Jewish and my stepmother is Irish. My father respected all women.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVPEC Zwolle is a Dutch football club based in Zwolle, currently playing in the Eredivisie, the country's highest level of professional club football. They have played in the Eredivisie for a total of 16 seasons, reaching sixth place in 2015. They won the KNVB Cup in 2014 and also reached the final in 1928, 1977 and 2015.\u000aThis is the second incarnation of the club; its predecessor of the same name went bankrupt in 1990. The current club was founded immediately afterwards as FC Zwolle before renaming back to PEC Zwolle in 2012.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Introduction ===\u000aPEC was founded on 12 June 1910, the name being an abbreviation of PH EDN Combinatie (PH EDN Combination). The club was formed by a merger of Prins Hendrik (1 April 1906; Prince Henry) and Ende Desespereert Nimmer (1904; And Never Despair). PEC has been a professional football club since 23 February 1955. The club name was changed to PEC Zwolle in 1971 and to PEC Zwolle '82 in 1982. Instantly after the bankruptcy a new name was chosen for the new club: FC Zwolle. On 14 April 2012, after the promotion, the club name was changed back to PEC Zwolle.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== PEC ===\u000aPEC was one of Zwolle's three top football clubs, along with ZAC (founded in 1893) and Zwolsche Boys (1918). ZAC was associated with the local high society, Zwolsche Boys were associated with the working class, while PEC was the club of the local middle class. There was considerable rivalry between these three clubs, especially between Zwolsche Boys and PEC. Not only were their stadiums on walking distance from each other, the clubs frequently met each other in league matches.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== PEC Zwolle ===\u000aDespite this rivalry, PEC and Zwolsche Boys merged in 1969, taking the name PEC. In 1971, this became PEC Zwolle, in an attempt to promote the image of the city of Zwolle. In 1977, PEC Zwolle reached the finals of the KNVB Cup, losing to Twente in extra time, and missed out on promotion to the Eredivisie by one point. In 1978, the club won the Dutch first division title and was promoted to the Eredivisie for the first time in its history. In its first season in the Eredivisie, the club finished eighth, which remained PEC Zwolle's highest ever league position until finishing sixth in 2014\u201315. Their most impressive result that season was a 0\u20131 away victory at PSV. These results were achieved by a talented group of players bought from other clubs, such as Rinus Israël. The money for this came from the Slavenburgs Bank, which was led by FC Zwolle chairman Jan Willem van der Wal. By 1982, the club had built up a debt of six million guilders and was on the verge of bankruptcy.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== PEC Zwolle '82 ===\u000aReal estate developer Marten Eibrink took over power in PEC Zwolle in 1982. He managed to end the debt and restructured the club, which was epitomized by a change in the name: PEC Zwolle '82. He also had the club's stadium renovated and decided to name the stadium's main stand the Johan Cruyff Stand, because Johan Cruyff had played his last official match against PEC Zwolle '82 on 13 May 1984. Eibrink brought legendary players like Piet Schrijvers, Johnny Rep and Cees van Kooten to the club. The club managed to revive, but the revival was short-lived. In 1985, PEC Zwolle '82 were relegated to the Dutch first division, largely due to an injury-ridden main squad. They managed to return after only one season, having finished in second place. That team was led by the coach Co Adriaanse and the player Foeke Booy. Eibrink, however, grew increasingly disappointed in sponsors and local authorities, accusing them of not loving the club in the way that he did, and he left the club in 1988. Despite a promising start to the 1988\u201389 season, the club finished in 16th place, which meant that it was relegated to the First Division. The financial crisis worsened, as sponsors refused to invest in the club any longer. The players' wages could not be paid, and a debt to the Slavenburgs Bank appeared which had been overseen by the board for around ten years. This led to the club's bankruptcy in March 1990.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== FC Zwolle ===\u000aAfter the bankruptcy, it was decided that the club had to sever all ties with the troubled finances of the past and make a fresh start. The club got a new name (FC Zwolle), a new organisational structure, new sponsors, new club colours (blue-white shirts with white shorts instead of green-white shirts with black shorts) and a new crest. The first years of the 'new' club were hard, but after 1992\u201393, a new team filled with talents such as Jaap Stam (who would later play for PSV, Manchester United, Lazio, Milan and Ajax), Bert Konterman (Feyenoord and Rangers), Johan Hansma (Heerenveen) and Henri van der Vegt (Udinese) played attractive and successful football. In 1992\u201393, FC Zwolle narrowly missed promotion to the Eredivisie. In the KNVB Cup, FC Zwolle reached the quarter-finals, losing to Feyenoord in a penalty shootout.\u000aAfter many failed attempts in the play-offs, FC Zwolle finally managed to secure a return to the Eredivisie by winning the First Division in 2002. In the 2002\u201303 Eredivisie season, the club finished in 16th place and escaped relegation via the play-offs. A year later, they made a miserable start to the season, and had scored only seven points halfway through the season. An impressive run, with victories over the likes of SC Heerenveen and AZ, proved in vain, as FC Zwolle dropped from a 16th place (which would have placed them in the play-offs) to the 18th place (direct relegation) on the last day of the season. They lost 7\u20131 away at Feyenoord, while their rivals Vitesse and Volendam managed to beat their opponents Utrecht and RBC Roosendaal.\u000aAt the beginning of the 2004\u201305 season, FC Zwolle was considered one of the favourites for the title in the First Division, along with Sparta Rotterdam. However, it was another club from the province of Overijssel, Heracles Almelo, that won the title. FC Zwolle finished the season in fourth place, and had to play play-off matches against the second- and sixth-placed teams of the First Division (Sparta and Helmond Sport) and the 17th-placed team of the Eredivisie, De Graafschap. They finished bottom of their group, with one point from six matches, while Sparta won the group and clinched promotion and De Graafschap was relegated.\u000aThe 2005\u201306 season started well, with FC Zwolle fighting for the league's top spot in the first months. However, the results dwindled in November and December. Angry supporters threatened trainer-coach Hennie Spijkerman after a 0\u20135 home defeat against Excelsior, and Spijkerman resigned a few days later. The club's chairman announced that he would crack down on the supporters involved, and said that some had already received stadium bans of up to 9 years. Spijkerman's assistant trainer Harry Sinkgraven finished the season, leading the club to the play-offs, in which Eredivisie side Willem II proved too strong.\u000aFormer Feyenoord and Ajax player Jan Everse, who had already trained the club between 1996 and 1999, was presented as the new trainer-coach. He was faced with financial problems at the club, and the departure of key striker Santi Kolk. Many players from the club's youth teams were brought into the main squad, with mixed results. The team ended at the ninth place of the table during the 2006\u201307 season.\u000aDuring the 2010\u201311 season, FC Zwolle held the top spot for a long time, but had to leave the title to RKC Waalwijk. Zwolle ended in 2nd place and didn't achieve promotion. The 2011\u201312 season was more successful. FC Zwolle won the title and secured their return to the Eredivisie in the 2012\u201313 season.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Back to PEC Zwolle and Dutch cup/Supercup triumph ===\u000aShortly after winning the championship of the Eerste Divisie, the club announced that the name will be changed to PEC Zwolle again.\u000aIn 2014, under the guidance of new head coach Ron Jans, PEC Zwolle earned their first major silverware by winning the KNVB Cup, beating league champions Ajax 5\u20131 in the final. Thus, PEC Zwolle qualified for the UEFA Europa League for the first time. On 3 August 2014, PEC Zwolle also won the 2014 Johan Cruijff Schaal (Dutch Supercup) by defeating AFC Ajax, this time by 1\u20130.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Stadiums ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Oosterenkstadion ===\u000a\u000aThe old stadium was built in 1934 and demolished in 2007. It was located at Business park Oosterenk. Since the completion in 1934 two different clubs played in the stadium. PEC from 1934 till 1957, Zwolsche Boys from 1957 till 1970. Since 1970 PEC played its games at the Oosterenk Stadium. The stadium had to be demolished because the new stadium is located at the same spot as the Oosterenk Stadium is.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== PEC Zwolle Stadion ===\u000a\u000aOfficially since 29 August 2009, the stadium is no longer under construction. Construction started at 9 March 2007. The first game in the new stadium was against MVV. The final score was 0\u20130. The first goal scored in the new stadium was by FC Zwolle player Bram van Polen, coming on 22 August 2008 against Cambuur.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== IJsseldelta Stadion ===\u000aOn 12 July 2012, the club officially announced the new name for their home ground, which is now called IJsseldelta Stadion.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== MAC³PARK stadion ===\u000aThe name of the stadium was on 1 July 2016 changed to MAC³PARK stadion.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Rivalries ==\u000a\u000aPEC Zwolle biggest rival is Go Ahead Eagles. Both clubs are located at the river IJssel, hence the name IJssel-derby. In the early years Go Ahead was the best club in the region but since the relegation to the Dutch First Division in 1987, Zwolle has won most derbies.\u000a\u000a\u000a== PEC Zwolle in the Eredivisie ==\u000a\u2020 as FC Zwolle\u000a\u000a\u000a== Domestic results ==\u000aBelow is a table with FC Zwolle's domestic results since the introduction of professional football in 1956.\u000aPEC Zwolle made it to the final round of the national cup four times. They only won in 2014. The first final was in 1928 against RHC Heemstede. The final score was 2\u20130. The second time they made it to the final was in 1977. The opponent that time was FC Twente. They lost 3\u20130 after extra time. The third time was in 2014, when they beat Ajax 5\u20131, subsequently claiming the cup for Zwolle for the first time in their history.

aVTwo English cricket teams toured Australia in 1887-88. They are generally known as A. Shrewsbury's XI and G. F. Vernon's XI. Shrewsbury's XI visited New Zealand in March.\u000aIn previous Australian seasons, no more than one English team had toured. The formation of two teams in 1887-88 was described by Wisden as "a piece of folly (that) will never be perpetrated again". The situation was perhaps inevitable given that English cricket still lacked a formal system to regulate the organisation of overseas tours. As a result, any promoter was free to form a team.\u000aWisden pointed out that "it was clear from the first that two combinations would not be able to pay their way, and, though we do not know the exact result of Shaw, Shrewsbury, and Lillywhite's venture, the Melbourne Club frankly admitted a heavy loss over Mr Vernon's team".\u000a\u000a\u000a== A Shrewsbury's XI ==\u000aThis team was formed by James Lillywhite, Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury after they received an invitation from various parties in Sydney. The players were a mixture of amateur and professional. Although the professional Shrewsbury was effectively the player/manager, the amateur Aubrey Smith was appointed team captain.\u000aShaw himself did not tour, but stayed at home to put together a football side that played rugby union and Victorian rules (now known as Australian rules) football in Australia after the cricket tour. The tour was a financial disaster, with the Melbourne Cricket Club, Lillywhite, Shaw and Shrewsbury well out-of-pocket. Lillywhite defaulted on his debt.\u000aThe team played seven first-class matches in Australia including two versus an Australia XI. They played New South Wales three times and individual matches versus Victoria and a Combined XI. Shrewsbury's XI also visited New Zealand but played no first-class matches there. In all matches in both countries, Shrewsbury's XI played 25, won 14, drew 9 and lost 2. In first-class matches (in Australia only), the team played 7, won 5 and lost 2.\u000aFor the New Zealand leg of the tour, see: History of New Zealand cricket to 1890\u000aThe team members were (amateurs denoted by title):\u000aMr C A Smith, captain (Sussex)\u000aArthur Shrewsbury (Notts)\u000aGeorge A Lohmann (Surrey)\u000aJ Maurice Read (Surrey)\u000aJohn Briggs (Lancashire)\u000aRichard Pilling (Lancashire)\u000aGeorge Ulyett (Yorkshire)\u000aJoseph M Preston (Yorkshire)\u000aMr W Newham (Sussex)\u000aMr George Brann (Sussex)\u000aMr L C Docker (Warwickshire)\u000aA D Pougher (Leicestershire)\u000aJames Lillywhite (Sussex)\u000a\u000a\u000a== G F Vernon's XI ==\u000aLord Hawke, then known as the Hon. M B Hawke, was invited by Melbourne Cricket Club to form this team which, like Shrewsbury's, comprised both amateurs and professionals. Hawke had to return to England at the start of the tour as his father had died, leaving George Vernon to captain the side.\u000aVernon's XI played eight first-class matches in Australia including two versus an Australia XI. They played twice versus each of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. The team visited Australia only and in all matches played 26, won 11, drew 14 and lost 1. In first-class matches, the team played 8, won 6, drew 1 and lost 1.\u000aThe team members were (amateurs denoted by title):\u000aMr G F Vernon, captain (Middlesex)\u000aThe Hon M B (now Lord) Hawke (Yorkshire)\u000aMr W W Read (Surrey)\u000aMr M P Bowden (Surrey)\u000aMr A E Stoddart (Middlesex)\u000aMr A E Newton (Somerset)\u000aMr T C O'Brien (Middlesex)\u000aWilliam Bates (Yorkshire)\u000aRobert Peel (Yorkshire)\u000aJ T Rawlin (Yorkshire)\u000aWilliam Attewell (Notts)\u000aJohn Beaumont (Surrey)\u000aRobert Abel (Surrey)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Test Match ==\u000a\u000aBoth teams played "Combined Australia" sides in matches that are not accorded Test match status. They formed a united England team in one Test with Walter Read appointed captain. Wisden doubted if the Australian team was truly representative.\u000aThe two teams combined as an England national cricket team during 10\u201315 February 1888 to play a timeless Test match versus Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. England won by 126 runs.\u000aEngland's team in the Test match was: Walter Read (captain), Arthur Shrewsbury, Andrew Stoddart, George Ulyett, Maurice Read, Bobby Peel, Billy Newham, George Lohmann, Johnny Briggs, William Attewell and Dick Pilling (wk).\u000aAustralia's team was: Alec Bannerman, Sammy Jones, Harry Moses, Frederick Burton, Jack Worrall, Patrick McShane, Percy McDonnell, Jack Blackham, Tom Garrett, Charlie Turner, John Ferris\u000aThe match was affected by wet weather and was low-scoring. Australia won the toss and decided to field. This probably looked like the right decision as Ferris and Turner took 9 wickets between them to dismiss England for 113, Arthur Shrewsbury top-scoring with 44. When Australia batted, Lohmann and Peel, bowling unchanged, reduced them to 35 for 8 at stumps on the first day. As a result of continuing rain, and an intervening Sunday, play could not resume for another 5 days. On resumption, Lohmann and Peel dismissed Australia for 42. Turner took 7 for 43 as England then set Australia 209 to win. They fell well short with Lohmann and Peel sharing 8 wickets and England won by 126 runs.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Match summary ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aCricketArchive\u000aWisden Archive Online\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000aChris Harte, A History of Australian Cricket, Andre Deutsch, 1993\u000aWisden Cricketers' Almanack 1889

aVGuy Edward Fletcher (born 24 May 1960 in Maidstone, Kent) is an English multi-instrumentalist, best known for his position as the keyboard player in the rock band Dire Straits from 1984 until the group's dissolution, and his subsequent work with Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aGuy Edward Fletcher was born into a musical family and is the namesake of his uncle, Guy Fletcher, who wrote several hit songs for other artists with composing partner Doug Flett. His mother Barbara was a session singer and his father Ted Fletcher, an audio designer, (Orbitsound) created a line of audio equipment named after Joe Meek with whom he had worked.\u000aWhilst learning a trade as an audio engineer at DJM Studios in London at the age of 15, Guy also had a succession of his own bands and learned to play keyboards, guitars, and a variety of stringed instruments. He joined and toured with Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel in 1979 and in 1981, Roxy Music for their 'Avalon' world tour. In 1983, Guy was recruited by Dire Straits' lead guitarist Mark Knopfler to work on the music for the films Cal and 'Comfort and Joy. He joined Dire Straits in 1984, a year before their most successful album, Brothers in Arms, which put the band in a globally acclaimed spotlight.\u000aIn 1986, Fletcher co-produced Belouis Some's album Belouis Some with Gary Langan.\u000aIn 1996, Fletcher toured as part of Bryan Ferry´s band on his Mamouna world tour.\u000a\u000aFollowing the disbanding of Dire Straits in 1995, Fletcher continued his association with band founder, Mark Knopfler as a core member of his band after launching his solo career. In 2005, Fletcher completed a world tour promoting Knopfler's 2004 solo album, Shangri-La, and in 2006 rounded off the duets tour with Knopfler and Emmylou Harris. Fletcher co-produced and played keyboards on his Knopfler's album, Get Lucky, and was again part of his subsequent world tour in 2010.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Solo work ==\u000aFletcher's first solo album, Inamorata, was released on 28 January 2008. Knopfler guests as lead guitarist for two tracks, and various musicians who have been associated with Knopfler's band also make appearances.\u000aOn 24 May 2010, Fletcher released his second solo album, titled Natural Selection.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Personal life ===\u000aFletcher lives with his Californian wife, Laura, and their two children, Max and Leon, in Aldwick, West Sussex. He is an avid windsurfer, golfer and paddleboarder. Guy has his own recording studio where he has recorded his own albums ('Inamorata', 'Stone' and 'Natural Selection'), scored film and television projects and produced other artists such as Brighton based 'Native Roses' and former Dire Straits colleague, John Illsley.\u000aFletcher's eldest son Max is also a musician, currently living in Brighton.\u000aOn his 48th birthday, Fletcher was given a red Mark Knopfler Stratocaster on stage in Brighton as a gift.\u000aFletcher is the nephew of the songwriter also called Guy Fletcher and the cousin of UK children's television presenter Justin Fletcher.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Solo ===\u000aInamorata (28 January 2008)\u000aStone (16 October 2009)\u000aNatural Selection (24 May 2010)\u000aHigh Roads (2016)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aGuyFletcher.co.uk

aVLake Athapapuskow is a glacial lake in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Canada, located 15 km (9.3 mi) southeast of Flin Flon, Manitoba. The lake is in the Hudson Bay drainage basin and is the source of the Goose River.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description ==\u000aLake Athapapuskow consists of three connected bodies of water, "Big Athapap" to the south, "Little Athapap" in the middle, and the "North Arm". Only 2 square kilometres (0.77 sq mi) of the lake, at the very west end of Big Athapap, is in Saskatchewan; the remaining 267 square kilometres (103 sq mi) of the lake is in Manitoba. There are three communities on the lake, Cranberry Portage on the southeast end, Millwater on the north shore of "Big Athapap", and Bakers Narrows between the "Little Athapap" and the "North Arm". The Flin Flon Airport is located on the north shore of "Little Athapap". Bakers Narrows Provincial Park straddles the narrows between the North Arm and Little Athapap. There are several fishing lodges located on the lake.\u000aThe lake is surrounded by Precambrian boreal forest, a mixed forest of coniferous and deciduous trees of the Canadian Shield. The area contains stands of black spruce, jack pine, white spruce, and trembling aspen. It drains via the Goose River (also known locally as the Rat River), and is part of the Nelson River basin.\u000aFish species include walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, lake trout, lake whitefish, burbot, rainbow trout, white sucker, Tullibee, splake and small mouth bass. The lake is well known for its sport fishing and has held three world records to date. In 1937, Leone Grayson caught a world record Lake Trout off Gull Island, a feat recorded in a memorial cairn at the Bakers Narrows Campground.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aThe area has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Archaeological digs at Bakers Narrows revealed pottery, arrowheads, and other artifacts which were at least 2,500 years old and indicated regular habitation by the "Shield Archaic Culture", who hunted caribou in the area as far back as 7000 years ago. They were eventually supplanted by the Woodland Cree who were nomadic hunters in this region. The site of Cranberry Portage has been the primary route linking the Grass River and Saskatchewan River watersheds for at least 2,000 years.\u000aMany of the most important explorers in Canadian history travelled through Lake Athapapuskow. In 1763, Hudson's Bay Company explorers Joseph Smith and Isaac Batt, guided by Cree leader Meesinkeeshick, became the first European recorded to visit Lake Athapapuskow; Smith died on the return journey to York Factory. Ten years later, the Governor of Churchill sent the fur trader Joseph Hansom, also guided by Cree, inland to extend the reach of the HBC. He paddled from Lake Kississing down the Pineroot River, reaching Lake Athapapuskow. In 1774, the explorer Samuel Hearne with 2 Englishmen, 6 native guides, and 5 canoes, laden with "180 lbs. Brazil Tobacco, 130 lbs. Powder, 100 wt. of Shott & Ball, 6 Gallns Brandy and some other trifling articles of Trading goods" paddled up the Grass River to Cranberry Portage and into Lake Athapapuskow en route to establishing Cumberland House. This route became an important part of the North American fur trade, known as the "Upper Tract". It was abandoned by 1800 in favour of the Nelson River and Hayes River routes. In 1794, the fur-trader and cartographer David Thompson, surveyed the lake.\u000aThe lake first appeared on a map drawn by Peter Pond in 1785 and was described as the "Middle Road to Hudson's Bay". The name of the lake was first noted In 1806, when explorer and surveyor Peter Fidler recorded the main waterways of his Cree partners in the notable "Cha Chay Pay Way Ti\u2019s Map of the Waterways of a Part of Northern Manitoba", Cranberry Portage and Lake Athapapuskow are clearly marked on it. In 1896 J.B. Tyrell surveyed a portion of the south shore, but due to its remoteness, the lake was not fully mapped until 1914 when the Geological Survey of Canada sent Everend Bruce to do so in 1914.\u000a\u000aAfter the discovery of ore at Flin Flon, the lake became an important transportation link. During the First World War, ore from the Mandy Mine on Schist Lake, was barged across Lake Athapapuskow on the stern-wheeler S.S. Tonapah on its way to The Pas where it was then shipped by rail for smelting. In 1917 a road first reached the south shore from Sturgeon Landing and in 1928 the Hudson Bay Railway reached Cranberry Portage. The town of Cranberry Portage itself was established on the southeast arm of the lake in 1922 when William Thompson built a house there. Manitoba Highway 10 reached Cranberry Portage in 1949 and was extended to Bakers Narrows in 1951. In 1961 Bakers Narrows Provincial Park was established on the lake. There are several fishing lodges located on the lake.\u000aThe name was officially registered in 1948 and is believed to be derived from "Athapa'puskow Saka'higan" meaning "rock on both sides lake" in Swampy Cree, which aptly describes the stony pre-Cambrian shores.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Islands ==\u000aThe lake has over 575 islands, most of them unnamed. Some of the named islands include:\u000aBakers Island\u000aFour Mile Island\u000aGull Island\u000aHalf Moon Island\u000aHudson Bay Island\u000aIsabelle's Island\u000aLog Cabin Island\u000aSee-Through Island\u000aSeven Mile Island\u000aSewell's Island\u000aSteckler's Island\u000aWashing Machine Island\u000aWindmill Island\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of lakes of Manitoba\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange AIM sub-market.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe company was founded in 1984 by structural engineer Michael Ellis. In the year to 30 April 2015, Van Elle\u2019s turnover rose 57% from 2014's £46m to £72.5m for the year to April 2015. Profit more than tripled, from £2.8m to £9m, and headcount grew from around 300 to over 400.\u000aBy 2016, the company had worked on projects for Network Rail, Balfour Beatty and Morgan Sindall Group. In October 2016, the company was floated on the AIM sub-market of the London Stock Exchange, achieving a market capitalisation of £80m. Van Elle was forecasting revenues for 2016 approaching £85m.\u000aEllis retired the following December, but remained a shareholder in the company. In 2017, delays in rail projects caused turnover to drop.\u000aIn November 2017, Ellis started an attempt to remove the company's chief executive Jon Fenton and a senior independent director, Robin Williams, citing concerns about the company's management, departures of key staff and financial forecasts.\u000aDuring the dispute, the company faced questions after it wrote off more than £330,000 of work building a new house for Fenton (who announced he would be stepping down from the company due to a family illness), while Ellis accused Van Elle directors of making personal attacks ahead of a shareholders' vote in December on returning him to the board. The board rebutted Ellis's criticism accusing him of damaging the company.\u000aAt the shareholders meeting, Ellis's bid to return to the board was rejected.\u000aIn January 2018, the company warned it would potentially lose £1.6 million as a result of the collapse of Carillion, for whom it was working as a subcontractor on projects for Network Rail. Van Elle also reported uncertainty relating to £2.5m worth of future work for Network Rail, with a potential impact on future financial results.

aVDennis Neilson-Terry (21 October 1895 \u2013 14 July 1932) was a British actor, theatre manager and producer, who starred in a number of films between 1917 and 1932.\u000aHe was the son of the actor Fred Terry and his wife, the actress Julia Neilson. In his early years he had been seen as a rising Shakespearean. After the First World War he specialised, as his parents had done before him, in less demanding roles in ephemeral but popular and profitable plays. While touring in southern Africa with such a repertory he contracted pneumonia and died at the age of 36.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life and career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Family ===\u000aDennis Neilson-Terry was born in London into the Terry family of actors.

He made his first regular appearance on the stage under the name of Derrick Dennis, at the New Theatre in May 1911, as Silvius in As You Like It. In his parents' company he played Armand St Just in The Scarlet Pimpernel, after which he widened his Shakespearean repertoire during a year's tour with F R Benson's company, playing Lorenzo (The Merchant of Venice, Silvius, Rosencrantz in Hamlet, Paris in Romeo and Juliet, Octavius Caesar in Antony and Cleopatra, Demetrius in A Midsummer Night's Dream and Malcolm in Macbeth.\u000aIn 1912, under Herbert Beerbohm Tree's management, Neilson-Terry played Sebastian in Twelfth Night opposite the Viola of his sister. For Lillah McCarthy and Harley Granville-Barker he played Florizel in The Winter's Tale, and Sebastian in Twelfth Night later in 1912. The Times praised his "dainty" playing in the former, and commented that he was "evidently gifted with a full measure of the family talent."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Leading man ===\u000aIn 1913 Neilson-Terry was given his first starring role, in Romeo and Juliet. The Manchester Guardian said:\u000a\u000aMr Dennis Neilson-Terry looks a perfect Romeo \u2013 so extremely decorative and suitable. He has, for a start, the supreme advantage of being very young in every way. He is a wistful, wide-eyed, bewildered Romeo, with whom you cannot but be sympathetic. ... But being very young has its drawbacks, too, and Mr Terry lacks the power to be convincingly passionate in his lovemaking. That may come with riper years. \u2026 But he gives a quite definite and pleasing presentation of a difficult part, and in doing so he discloses that he has most of the qualities that go to make a popular actor, if not a very great one.\u000a\u000aNeilson-Terry's roles between then and the First World War included Louis Dubedat in The Doctor's Dilemma (1913), and Oberon in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1914). The reviewer in The Times said of his performance in the latter that he dominated the whole play, "informs it with graciousness and majesty \u2026 and exquisite rhythmic beauty."\u000aDuring the war Neilson-Terry served in the Royal West Surrey Regiment, and was demobilised in 1917, when he resumed his theatrical career. In his post-war productions he opted for crowd-pleasing, light plays, as his father had done before him. As The Manchester Guardian put it, "Before the war Mr Neilson-Terry was characteristically a Shakespearean and romantic actor. After the war he put on horned spectacles and a scarf, resembled Mr Harold Lloyd of the films, and acted 'silly ass' detectives who were cleverer than they looked." Of his later stage productions, one performance stood out: that of a frightened man in a haunted room in Ned Lathom's play Fear, which, the Guardian critic wrote, "signalled unmistakably that Neilson-Terry was a developing actor with his best work still to come".\u000aTogether with his wife, Neilson-Terry made successful appearances in New York and South Africa, and it was after a tour of the latter that he contracted pneumonia, and died in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia, at the age of 36. His body was taken back to England, and his funeral service was held at St Paul's, Covent Garden. He was buried in Hampstead Cemetery.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Filmography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aParker, John (1925). Who's Who in the Theatre (fifth ed.).

In 2001 he became a member of the editorial board of the National Review Online.\u000aPrior to the new healthcare laws in the United States, Seeman was quoted discussing the need for disruptive innovation, more attention to financial variables, and other new ideas in the healthcare industry. In 1998, Seeman was a pre-IPO investor in the successful NASDAQ-listed Internet (JCOM) software and technology company, J2 Global, specializing in cloud services for businesses and multi-messaging. In the late 2000s, following research positions at the Hospital Report Research Collaborative at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, and at IBM, Seeman founded and became the CEO of the University of Toronto\u2019s Health Strategy Innovation Cell, focusing on low-cost Internet-based solutions in healthcare. Seeman has published in academic journals including Healthcare Quarterly, Health Care Management Review, Healthcare Policy, Electronic Healthcare, Journal of Participatory Medicine, Synapse, Nature, Journal of Affective Disorders, Psychiatric Times, Canadian Medical Association Journal, and Journal of Psychiatric Practice. He is currently an Adjunct Professor at the University of Toronto in the Institute for Health Policy, Management & Evaluation and at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health Policy and Senior Fellow at Massey College, University of Toronto, as well as an Adjunct Professor at Ryerson University.

In October, 2014, Neil Seeman won in the individual category of the NGMR Disruptive Innovation Awards for "outspoken advocates for innovation and disruption".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Business career ==\u000aSeeman is the founder and CEO of The RIWI Corporation, a company used for an all-country and all-device online and randomized non-panel survey technology platform Seeman invented in 2007 and patented in 2011. RIWI offers a patented random domain intercept technology (RDIT) that is a new approach to capturing a non-incented global stream of respondents and data. On June 18, 2013, The RIWI Corporation won the Insight Innovation Competition (IIeX) at the annual Insight Innovation exchange North America for its disruptive online data capture methodology. In the 2012 Crédit Agricole Securities Report, RIWI published its 2012 Egypt elections data, and has since been credited as being "the only research firm to predict the Egypt election" in 2012.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Books ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Book chapters ===\u000aIn 2002 Seeman published the chapter "Low-Tech, Low-Brow" in the book Better Medicine: Reforming Canadian Health Care.

Seeman highlighted that about a third of healthcare spending in Canada was directly linked to obesity. He himself lost nearly eighty pounds while writing the book. Drawing on global RIWI data, the book also discusses the correlation between countries that have the highest level of obesity and the countries most willing to shame its obese citizens. Seeman claims that despite its use in prior health crises, shaming is not a solution for obesity. The Wall Street Journal wrote that Seeman claims the most effective healthcare solutions would "annoy both the left and the right", and have to be apolitical in nature. The book was short-listed for the Donner Prize in 2012. Terrence Sullivan stated the authors' idea for "healthy living vouchers" to curb obesity was "empowering the citizen as consumer and he or she will choose wisely and buy lifestyle, diet and exercise experiences tailored to his or her needs to lose weight...The voucher solution may be a touch too close to a one-trick pony in a world where many taxpayers might want their government to spend the money elsewhere. Nevertheless they have provided us with a clear summary of our current obesity challenges alongside the range of possible avenues to take on this "wicked problem," Seeman and Luciani's public policy book received an "Outstanding" rating from the 2012 University Press Books committee.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ebooks ===\u000aIn December 2012, with co-author and RIWI President Eric Meerkamper, Seeman published the e-book Smarter Data: Eliciting Insights from the Cloud. In October, 2013, he co-authored the e-book GRIT Consumer Participation in Research (CPR) Report: A Study of Survey-Takers in 200+ Countries and Regions around the World with Alton Ing.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVExtreme Croquet is a variation on croquet mainly distinguished by its lack of any requirement pertaining to out-of-bounds or field specifications. A close relative of the croquet played in most backyards and gardens, but expanded by more adventurous enthusiasts and played throughout the world in conditions unfamiliar to official tournament players.\u000aThe main organisation in terms of officialdom is IFEC (International Federation of Extreme Croquet) founded in 1897 by Lord Barney and Colonel Tex from Team GB. The current president is Stanislav Zeljezenicar from Bosnia & Herzegovina, he was elected at the 44th croqlave to be held on the cliffs of Yarmouth (in memoriam).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Game setup ==\u000aA typical extreme croquet game starts with location scouting, searching for terrain that might present interesting and novel challenges such as trees, roots, hills, sand, mud, or moving or still water. Play proceeds following the usual croquet rules, with alterations generally designed to handle circumstances not found in the garden game.\u000aTraditional backyard croquet equipment can be used but is prone to damage. Mallets, made specifically for extreme croquet, are made from high-density polyethylene, aluminum, polycarbonate and other durable materials.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Rules ==\u000aDifferent organizations use different sets of rules for extreme croquet. Variations include the following:\u000aWhen one ball strikes another, the striker may choose to continue play as the strikee's ball.\u000aA player receives an extra stroke for passing through a second story of a wicket.\u000aA player may strike the ball with any part of the mallet, including a billiards-reminiscent style.\u000aThe first player through the second wicket determines the direction of play.\u000aAs each player reaches the starting post after clearing all wickets, he is "poison" and must declare his status to all players.\u000aA non-poison player can eliminate a poison player by sending the latter through a wicket.\u000aPassing through a wicket out of order is punished by sending the ball back to the previous post.\u000aSmall children and dogs are legal obstacles, and if they interfere with the ball's placement, the player must still "play it where it lies."\u000aThe Richmond Extreme Croquet Group has these rules:\u000aRevert Rule: If a ball traverses its prior wicket in the opposite direction, this now becomes its current wicket; exceptions: (1) a rover cannot be reverted; (2) until the ball remakes that wicket, it cannot be reverted again.\u000aNosering Rule: Once per game, at the end of one's turn, one may move one's ball exactly one mallet head, except not into or thru any wicket in either direction; in a team game, one may use a teammate's unused nosering move.\u000aAlzheimer's Rule: Before or after hitting the ball, if that player or anyone else realizes that the player forgot his current wicket, the hit is retaken (if in fact it has been taken), except when croqueting another ball; all players have the obligation to point this out.\u000aActs of Dog: If a player's ball is relocated by an unleashed dog, it shall be played from the location the dog releases the ball. If the ball is released out of bounds, then the ball shall be played from the point (after adjusting for a mallet width from the boundary) it was removed from the field.\u000aDynamic Starting Order: After lagging to the stake for starting order, the players exercise the option to go or not go in order of closeness; after each player goes, the remaining players re-choose who goes next in the same order.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Extreme croquet locations ==\u000aExtreme croquet dates back to the 1920s, when fashionable folks built courses with sand traps and other hazards in California and on Long Island. The world's oldest extreme croquet club was founded 1975 in Sweden. The first documented extreme croquet matches in the United States took place in Friendswood, Texas, around 1995. A group of college kids looking for a bit more excitement than the traditional game could offer began to test the boundaries of the sport.\u000aBoston University is the home of BU International Extreme Croquet Society. The organization was founded in 2008. On April 5, 2010 BU Today featured a film  on the club.\u000aThe Northwest Arkansas Nonprofessional-professional Extreme Croquet Association, or NANECA utilizes both urban and natural settings for its free flowing extreme croquet.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Articles ==\u000a"A Short History of Croquet" introduction to croquet\u000a"Extreme Satisfaction" feature article in Washington D.C.

The 2015 season was contested over eight races at eight meetings, beginning at Motorland Aragón on 12 April and ending at Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours on 4 October.\u000aWith an eighth-place finish in the final race of the year at Magny-Cours, Italy's Lorenzo Savadori \u2013 riding for the Nuova M2 Racing team \u2013 became the series champion, winning the first title in the class for Aprilia. Savadori won four of the eight races to be held in 2015, including three successive wins at Assen, Imola and Donington Park, and ultimately won the championship by twenty-two points ahead of BMW rider Roberto Tamburini, riding for Team MotoxRacing. Tamburini was a three-time race winner, winning at Motorland Aragón, Portimão and Jerez. Raffaele De Rosa completed the championship top-three, who took six podium finishes for Althea Racing. Fourth place in the championship went to the only other race-winner during the 2015 season, Frenchman Jérémy Guarnoni, who achieved a victory on home soil \u2013 at Magny-Cours \u2013 for Team Trasimeno.\u000aIn the manufacturers' championship, Savadori's four wins for Aprilia also aided the marque to the title, winning it at the final round as well. Aprilia finished 34 points clear of BMW, with Ducati a further 5 points behind.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Race calendar and results ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Championship standings ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Riders' championship ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Manufacturers' championship ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Entry list ==\u000aAll entries used Pirelli tyres.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial website

aVJonathan Kipnis is the Harrison Distinguished Teaching Professor and Chair of the Department of Neuroscience, and Director of the Center for Brain Immunology and Glia at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. He studies the interaction of the immune system with the nervous system and has been the senior author of a number of landmark papers in this field. His lab currently is studying several diverse topics within this subject, including CNS injury, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers, cognitive and mental disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and Rett syndrome.\u000aKipnis joined the faculty at UVA in 2007 and was made chair of the Department of Neuroscience in 2016. He earned his Ph.D. from the Weizmann Institute of Science in the lab of Michal Schwartz, and upon graduating in 2004, he received the Prize of Excellence from the Weizmann Institute of Science and a distinguished prize for scientific achievements awarded by the Israeli Parliament, The Knesset.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discoveries ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Meningeal lymphatic vessels ===\u000aKipnis is credited with the 2014 discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels, a recently discovered network of conventional lymphatic vessels located parallel to the dural sinuses and meningeal arteries of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). As a part of the lymphatic system, the meningeal lymphatics are responsible for draining immune cells, small molecules, and excess fluid from the CNS and into the deep cervical lymph nodes.\u000aWhile it was initially believed that both the brain and meninges were devoid of lymphatic vasculature, the landmark Nature paper by Jonathan Kipnis and his postdoctoral fellow Antoine Louveau was published in 2015. By 2017, this paper was cited nearly 600 times, putting it in the 99th percentile for articles published that year.\u000aHis discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels has attracted attention from many sources, and was touted as a scientific breakthrough in lists such as Scientific American's "Top 10 Science Stories of 2015", Science Magazine's "Breakthrough of the Year", Huffington Post's "Eight Fascinating Things We Learned About the Mind in 2015" and the National Institutes of Health's director Francis Collins year end review. Business Insider highlighted this as the biggest discovery ever made in Virginia.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Other discoveries ===\u000aOther high-profile research has included the 2015 discovery that the immune system directly affects social behavior and that IFN-gamma is necessary for social development. This expands upon his work as a graduate student, when he discovered that mice lacking T-cells had cognitive impairments.\u000aHe is the senior author of a 2015 paper describing how CD4+ T-cells protect and repair neurons after injury to the spinal cord and brain. A collaboration with Kodi Ravichandran characterized the generation of neurons in adult brains and the removal of dead neurons by phagocytic cells.\u000aIn 2016, he was the senior author on a paper identifying type 2 innate lymphocytes in the meninges near the lymphatic vessels his lab previously discovered. These cells have previously have been found in the gut, which suggests a link between the brain and the microbiome. In mice, these meningeal ILC2 cells were activated by IL-33 after spinal cord injury.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Grants and awards ==\u000aHis work has been funded by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, National Institutes of Health, the Hartwell Foundation, and the Cure Alzheimer's Fund. He is a Gutenberg Forschungskolleg Fellow and supervises a working group at the University of Mainz. He received the Robert Ader New Investigator Award for 2011 by the PsychoNeuroImmunology Research Society and the 2012 Jordi Folch-Pi award by the American Society for Neurochemistry.

aVEggheads is a BBC Television quiz show that airs on weekdays. It was first broadcast in 2003 chaired by Dermot Murnaghan. In 2008 Jeremy Vine became joint chair, and subsequently sole chair. In each episode, a team of five quiz and game show champions (the Eggheads) is challenged by a team of five contestants for prize money.\u000aThe most prize money that has been won is £75,000, in 2007. Some teams have been reduced to one contestant for the final round, but have still beaten five Eggheads. Occasionally, one remaining Egghead will beat five challengers. Only once have the Eggheads lost four games in succession and only twice has a team of all five challengers won the final round.\u000aOccasional teams of celebrities challenge the Eggheads in short series, with their own rolling prize fund.\u000aThe show has resulted in three spinoff series: Are You an Egghead? (2008), Revenge of the Egghead (2014) and Make Me an Egghead (2016).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Hosts ==\u000aThe show began in 2003 with Dermot Murnaghan as the presenter. From 2008, Jeremy Vine presented when Murnaghan was hosting the spinoff series. After the spin-off show finished, Murnaghan and Vine continued to host the series on a rotational basis, with Murnaghan typically hosting the first half of each series and Vine taking over for the second half. From series 16 Vine became the sole presenter.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Format ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Rounds ===\u000aThe show is played in five rounds. The first four rounds each focus on one subject category (of nine) while the final round tests general knowledge. In the first four rounds, the challengers choose a member of their own team to play, and an Egghead against whom they wish to compete. The players for that round then leave the studio to go into the "Question Room". The challenger is given the choice of going first or second. Both players are asked in turn three multiple-choice questions. If there is no winner, the round goes into sudden death with no choices given for answers.\u000aThe player who wins each round earns a place in the final round, while the losing players are eliminated from the game.\u000aThe general knowledge round is then played the same way as the previous rounds but challengers, if more than one remains, can confer. If they win they take the prize money; if the Eggheads win, the prize money is increased by £1,000 for the next quiz.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Subjects ===\u000aThere are nine (formerly eight) possible subjects for the first rounds. They are:\u000aArts & Books\u000aEntertainment (2003-2008)\u000aFilm & Television (2008-present)\u000aFood & Drink\u000aGeography\u000aHistory\u000aMusic (2008-present)\u000aPolitics\u000aScience\u000aSport\u000aMusic and Film & Television were introduced in Autumn 2008 through a split of the Entertainment category. Subjects can appear in any order, although at least one of Sport, Music or Film and Television will appear in every episode.\u000a\u000a\u000a== "Eggheads" ==\u000aIn the first eight series, the team consisted of only five Eggheads who each appeared in every episode and did not rotate. At the end of 2008, a sixth Egghead was added and appearances rotated. From series 15, five of eight possible Eggheads appear each episode, and later in 2016, two brand-new Eggheads (one male and one female) joined the panel after a spin-off series entitled Make Me an Egghead.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Current Eggheads ===\u000aKevin Ashman (2003\u2013present) is the eight-time winner of the British Quiz Championship, the winner of the third series of Fifteen to One in 1989, the 1995 Mastermind (including all-time record score), the 1996 Brain of Britain (including all-time record score), its 3-yearly Brain of Brains and 9-yearly Top Brain in 1998, the Fifteen to One: Millenium Edition in 1999, the twelve time Brain of London winner, the twice Gold Medallist for quizzing at the Mind Sports Olympiad, the two time Master Brain, and the winner of Sale of the Century, Quiz Night, Trivial Pursuit and The Great British Quiz.

The series ran for a 6-week period, between 24 February and 4 April 2014. Lisa Thiel appeared on the show as part of a winning team before becoming an Egghead herself shortly afterwards.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Main game ====\u000aEach contestant, in turn, is asked a general knowledge question. If their answer is right, £200 is added to the prize fund but if their answer is wrong and de Mooi knows their answer is wrong, he presses a red button in front of him to answer the same question. If he gets it wrong and the contestant gets it right, an additional £100 is added to the prize fund. If he gets it right, the contestant is asked a multiple-choice question by de Mooi.

aVThe SS William G. Mather was a 533-foot (162 m) long Great Lakes freighter that was built in 1905, by the Great Lakes Engineering Works (GLEW) of Ecorse, Michigan, for the Grand Island Steamship Company (managed by Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company). Her keel was laid on May 18, 1905. She was launched on September 23, 1905, as hull #9. She was powered by a 2,000 horsepower triple expansion steam engine which was attached to a single fixed pitch propeller. She was fueled by two coal-fired scotch marine boilers. She is notable for being the first Great Lakes freighter with a 60-foot (18 m) beam. She entered service in January, 1905.\u000a\u000a\u000a== New owners ==\u000aIn 1919 the Mather was transferred to the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company of Cleveland, Ohio. She served for six years under her original name. In 1925 Cleveland-Cliffs acquired a new freighter (also named William G. Mather) because of this, the Mather was renamed J.H. Sheadle. In 1932 the Sheadle was re-registered to Wilmington, Delaware. She operated for thirty years under the name J.H. Sheadle. In 1955 she was renamed H.L. Gobeille. She did not sail throughout the 1962 and the 1963 seasons.\u000aIn 1964 the Gobeille was sold to the Gartland Steamship Company of Chicago, Illinois. After she was acquired by Gartland Steamship, she was converted to a self-unloading freighter by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company. In 1965 she was renamed Nicolet. In 1969 Gartland Steamship's fleet was sold to the American Steamship Company of Buffalo, New York (managed by Boland & Cornelius). In 1974 the Nicolet had a new diesel installed by the Defoe Shipbuilding Company of Bay City, Michigan. On December 29, 1979 the Nicolet's forward cabins were seriously damaged in a fire that broke out on her self-unloading gear when it was ignited by sparks from an acetylene torch, while she was being repaired in Toledo, Ohio by the Hans Hansen Welding Company. A new pilothouse and cabins were installed by the American Shipbuilding Company. The Nicolet resumed service in 1981.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Scrapping ==\u000aShe was laid up in 1990 never to sail again. In 1996 she was sold for scrap to the International Marine Salvage Company. She was towed to Port Maitland, Ontario and scrapped.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aSteamship William G.

aVThe Children's Food Trust (formerly the School Food Trust, renamed in 2012) was a charity in the United Kingdom that sought to promote healthy eating for children.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe Trust was created as a non-departmental public body in 2005 by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES), following celebrity chef Jamie Oliver's critique of the nutritional quality of school meals in his TV documentary Jamie's School Dinners and the recommendations of the School Meals Review Panel. It had been found that standards of school food were low, with average ingredient spend per meal before 2005 at secondary schools at around 40p. Childhood obesity is a problem in the UK in specific demographic groups (see National Statistics Socio-economic Classification), with some medical professionals predicting that today's youngsters will have a lower life expectancy than their parents with problems with diabetes and heart disease.\u000aIn April 2007, the Trust also became a registered charity. In October 2011, the Trust officially ceased to be an NDPB, expanding its work both as a charity and by trading its services through a new community interest company, as the Children's Food Trust.\u000aIn November 2006, Prue Leith was named as the chair.

aVThe social history of the United Kingdom from 1945 began with the aftermath of the Second World War. The United Kingdom was one of the victors, but victory was costly in human and economic terms. Thus, the late 1940s was a time of austerity and economic restraint, which gave way to prosperity in the 1950s. The Labour Party held control from 1945\u201351, and granted independence to India in 1947. Most of the other major colonies became independent in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Britain collaborated closely with the United States during the Cold War after 1947, and in 1949 helped form NATO as a military alliance against Soviet Communism. After a long debate and initial scepticism, the UK joined the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973, but voted to leave the European Union (EU) in 2016. Immigration from South Asia, the West Indies, and Eastern Europe produced a multicultural society, while traditional Anglican and other denominations of Christianity declined sharply.\u000aProsperity returned in the 1950s, reaching the middle class and, to a large extent, the working class across Britain. London remained a world centre of finance and culture, but the nation was no longer a superpower. In foreign policy Britain promoted the Commonwealth (in the economic sphere) and the Atlantic Alliance (in the military sphere). In domestic policy a Post-war consensus saw the leadership of the Labour and Conservative parties largely agreed on Keynesian policies, with support for trades unions, regulation of business, and nationalisation of many older industries. The discovery of North Sea oil eased some financial pressures, but the 1970s saw slow growth, higher unemployment, and escalating labour strife. Deindustrialisation or the loss of heavy industry, especially coal mining, shipbuilding and manufacturing, grew worse after 1970 as Britain's economy shifted to services. London and the south east maintained prosperity as London became the leading financial center in Europe and played a major world role.\u000aHigher education expanded rapidly and attracted an international clientele, while debates raged on the elitist effect of grammar schools. The status of women slowly improved. A youth culture emerged from the 1960s with such iconic international celebrities as The Beatles and Princess Diana. Conservative prime minister, Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) rejected the post-war consensus in the 1980s, denationalised most industries, and worked to weaken the power of the unions. The "New Labour" premiership of Tony Blair (1997\u20132007) accepted most of Thatcher's economic policies. Devolution became a major topic, as Scotland and Wales gained more local control. In 2014, Scotland voted 55% to 45% to remain in the UK.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Post-war era ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Age of Austerity ===\u000a\u000aIn May 1945, the governing coalition dissolved, triggering the long-overdue 1945 general election. Labour won just under 50% of the vote and a majority of 145 seats. The new Prime Minister Clement Attlee proclaimed, "This is the first time in the history of the country that a labour movement with a socialist policy has received the approval of the electorate."\u000aDuring the war, surveys showed public opinion moving to the left and in favour of wide social reform. The public associated the Conservative Party with the poverty and mass unemployment of the inter-war years. Historian Henry Pelling, noting that polls showed a steady Labour lead after 1942, points to the usual swing against the party in power; the Conservative loss of initiative; wide fears of a return to the high unemployment of the 1930s; the theme that socialist planning would be more efficient in operating the economy; and the mistaken belief that Churchill would continue as prime minister regardless of the result. The sense that all Britons had joined in a "People's War" and all deserved a reward animated voters.\u000aAs the war ended and American Lend Lease suddenly and unexpectedly ended, the Treasury was near bankruptcy and Labour's new programmes would be expensive. The economy did not reach prewar levels until the 1950s. The immediate post-war years were called the Age of Austerity.\u000aThe war almost bankrupted Britain, while the country maintained a global empire in an attempt to remain a global power. For instance, it opearted a large air force and a conscript army. Without Lend Lease, bankruptcy loomed. The government secured a low-interest $3.75 billion loan from the US in December 1945. Rebuilding necessitated fiscal austerity in order to maximise export earnings, while Britain's colonies and other client states were required to keep their reserves in pounds as "sterling balances". An additional $3.2 billions of dollars \u2013 which did not have to be repaid \u2013 came from the American Marshall Plan in 1948\u201352. However the Plan did require Britain to modernise its business practices and remove trade barriers. Britain was an enthusiastic supporter of the Marshall Plan, and used it as a lever to more directly promote European unity. Britain was an enthusiastic cofounder of the NATO military alliance against the Soviets, which was formed in 1949.\u000aRationing and conscription continued in the post-war years as the government tried to control demand and normalise the economy. Anxieties were heightened when the country suffered one of the worst winters on record in 1946\u201347: the coal and railway systems failed, factories closed, and a large proportion of the population suffered due to the cold.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Rationing ====\u000aWartime rationing continued, and was for the first time extended to bread in order to feed the German civilians in the British sector of occupied Germany. During the war, the government had banned ice cream and rationed sweets, such as chocolates and confections; all sweets were rationed until 1954. Most people grumbled, but for the poorest, rationing was beneficial, because their rationed diet was of greater nutritional value than their pre-war diet. Housewives organised to oppose the austerity. The Conservatives gained support by attacking socialism, austerity, rationing and economic controls and returned to power in 1951.\u000aMorale was boosted by the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Philip Mountbatten in 1947, The 1948 Summer Olympics were held in London. Reconstruction had begun in London, but no funding was available for new facilities.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Welfare state ====\u000a\u000aThe most important Labour initiatives were the expansion of the welfare state, the founding of the National Health Service and nationalisation of the coal, gas, electricity, railways and other primary industries. The welfare state was expanded by the National Insurance Act 1946, which built upon the comprehensive system of social security originally set up in 1911. People of working age had to pay a weekly contribution (by buying a stamp) and in return were entitled to a wide range of benefits, including a pension, health and unemployment benefits, and widows' benefits.\u000aThe National Health Service began operations in July 1948. It promised to give cradle to grave free hospital and medical care for everyone in the country, regardless of income. Labour went on to expand low cost council housing for the poor.\u000aThe Treasury, headed by Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Dalton, faced urgent problems. Half of the wartime economy had been devoted to mobilising soldiers, warplanes, bombs and munitions; a transition to a peacetime budget was begun, while attempting to control inflation. New loans from the US and Canada to replace Lend Lease were essential to sustain living conditions.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Housing ====\u000aHousing was a critical shortage. Air raids had destroyed a half million housing units; upgrades and repairs on undamaged units had been postponed. Three quarters of a million new dwellings were needed. The government aimed for 300,000 annually, compared to the maximum prewar rate of 350,000. However, shortages of construction workers, materials, and money limited progress. Not counting 150,000 temporary prefabricated units, the shortage reached 1.5 million units by 1951. Legislation kept rents down, but did not lead to an increase in the number of new homes. The ambitious New Towns project did not provide enough units. The Conservatives made housing a high priority and oversaw 2.5 million new units, two thirds of them through local councils. Haste made for dubious quality, and policy increasingly shifted toward renovation rather than new construction. Slums were cleared, opening the way for gentrification in the inner cities.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Nationalisation ====\u000a\u000aMartin Francis argues there was Labour Party consensus by 1945, both on the National Executive Committee and at party conferences, on a definition of socialism that stressed moral as well as material improvement. The Attlee government was committed to rebuilding British society as an ethical commonwealth, using public ownership and controls to abolish extremes of wealth and poverty. Labour's ideology contrasted sharply with the contemporary Conservative Party's defence of individualism, allowing people to keep much of the wealth they had created, inherited privileges and income inequality.\u000aAttlee's government nationalised major industries and utilities. It developed and implemented the "cradle to grave" welfare state conceived by liberal economist William Beveridge. The creation of Britain's publicly funded National Health Service under health minister Aneurin Bevan remains Labour's proudest achievement.\u000aHowever, the Labour Party had developed no detailed plans nationalization plans. Improvising, they started with the Bank of England, civil aviation, coal and Cable and Wireless. Then came railways, canals, road haulage and trucking, electricity, and gas. Finally came iron and steel, which was a special case because it was a manufacturing industry. Altogether, about one fifth of the economy was taken over. Labour dropped the notion of nationalising farms.\u000aOn the whole nationalisation went smoothly, with two exceptions. Nationalising hospitals was strongly opposed by practising physicians. Compromises allowed them also to have a private practice, and the great majority decided to work with the National Health Service. Much more controversial was the nationalisation of the iron and steel industry \u2014 unlike coal, it was profitable and highly efficient. Nationalisation was opposed by industry owners and executives, the business community as a whole and the Conservative Party as a whole. The House of Lords was also opposed, but the Parliament Act 1949 reduced its power to delay legislation to just one year. Finally in 1951, iron and steel were nationalised, but then Labour lost its majority. The Conservatives in 1955 returned them to private ownership.\u000aThe procedure used was developed by Herbert Morrison, who as Lord President of the Council chaired the Committee on the Socialisation of Industries. He followed the model that was already in place of setting up public corporations such as the BBC in broadcasting (1927). The owners of corporate stock were given government bonds, and the government took full ownership of each affected company, consolidating it into a national monopoly. The managers remained the same, only now they became civil servants working for the government. For the Labour Party leadership, nationalisation was a way to consolidate economic planning. It was not designed to modernise old industries, make them efficient, or transform their organisational structure. There was no money for modernisation, although the Marshall Plan, operated separately by American planners, did force many British businesses to adopt modern managerial techniques. Old line British Marxists were fervent believers in dialectical materialism and in fighting against capitalism and for workers' control, trade unionism, nationalisation of industry and centralized planning. They were now disappointed, as the nationalised industries seemed identical to the old private corporations, and national planning was made virtually impossible by the government\u2019s financial constraints. At Oxford a "New Left" started to emerge that rejected old-line approaches. Socialism was in place, but it did not seem to make a major difference. Rank-and-file workers had long been motivated to support Labour by tales of the mistreatment of workers by foremen and management. The foremen and the managers were the same people as before, with much the same power over the workplace. There was no worker control of industry. The unions resisted government efforts to set wages. By the time of the general elections in 1950 and 1951, Labour seldom boasted about its nationalisations. Instead Conservatives decried the inefficiency and mismanagement, and promised to reverse the treatment of steel and trucking.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Labour weaknesses ====\u000aLabour struggled to maintain its support. Realising the unpopularity of rationing, in 1948\u201349 the government ended the rationing of potatoes, bread, shoes, clothing and jam, and increased the petrol ration for summer drivers. However, meat was still rationed, and in very short supply, at high prices. Militant socialist Aneurin Bevan, the Minister of Health, said at a party rally in 1948, "no amount of cajolery... can eradicate from my heart a deep burning hatred for the Tory Party.... They are lower than vermin." Bevan, a coal miner's son, had gone too far in a land that took pride in self-restraint, and he never lived down the remark.\u000aLabour narrowly won the 1950 general election with a majority of five seats. Defence became one of the divisive issues for Labour itself, especially defence spending, which reached 14% of GDP in 1951 during the Korean War. These costs strained public finances. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Hugh Gaitskell, introduced prescription charges for NHS dentures and spectacles, leading Bevan, along with Harold Wilson (President of the Board of Trade) to resign. A decade of turmoil ensued in the Party, much to the advantage of the Conservatives who won again and again by ever larger majorities.\u000aDavid Kynaston argues that the Labour Party under Prime Minister Attlee was led by conservative parliamentarians who always worked through constitutional parliamentary channels; they saw no need for large demonstrations, boycotts or symbolic strikes. The result was a solid expansion and coordination of the welfare system, most notably the concentrated and centralised NHS. Private sector nationalisation focused on older, declining industries, most notably coal mining. Labour kept promising systematic economic planning, but never established adequate mechanisms. Much of the planning was forced upon them by the Marshall Plan, which insisted on a modernisation of business procedures and government regulations. The Keynesian model accepted by Labour emphasised that planning could be handled indirectly through national spending and tax policies.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Cold War ====\u000aBritain faced severe financial constraints, lacking cash for needed imports. It responded by reducing its international entanglements as in Greece, and by sharing the hardships of an "age of austerity." Early fears that the US would veto nationalisation or welfare policies proved groundless.\u000aUnder Attlee foreign policy was the domain of Ernest Bevin, who looked for innovative ways to bring western Europe together in a military alliance. One early attempt was the Dunkirk Treaty with France in 1947. Bevin's commitment to the West European security system made him eager to sign the Treaty of Brussels in 1948. It drew Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg into an arrangement for collective security, opening the way for the formation of NATO in 1949. NATO was primarily aimed as a defensive measure against Soviet expansion, while helping bring its members closer together and enabled them to modernise their forces along parallel lines, also encouraging arms purchases from Britain.\u000aBevin began the process of dismantling the British Empire when it granted independence to India and Pakistan in 1947, followed by Burma (Myanmar) and Ceylon (Sri Lanka) in 1948. In January 1947, the government decided to proceed with the development of Britain's nuclear weapons programme, primarily to enhance Britain's security and also its status as a superpower. A handful of top elected officials made the decision in secret, ignoring the rest of the cabinet, in order to forestall the Labour Party's pacifist and anti-nuclear wing.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Return of Churchill ===\u000aIn the late 1940s the Conservative Party exploited and incited growing public anger at food rationing, scarcity, controls, austerity and omnipresent government bureaucracy. They used the dissatisfaction with their opponent's socialist and egalitarian policies to rally middle-class supporters and score a political victory at the 1951 general election. Their appeal was especially effective to housewives, who faced more difficult shopping conditions after the war than during it.\u000a\u000aThe Labour Party kept slipping, interrupted by good moments such as the Festival of Britain in summer 1951, a national exhibition and fair held throughout the country. Historian Kenneth O. Morgan says the Festival was a "triumphant success" as every day thousands:\u000aflocked to the South Bank site [in London], to wander around the Dome of Discovery, gaze at the Skylon, and generally enjoy a festival of national celebration. Up and down the land, lesser festivals enlisted much civic and voluntary enthusiasm. A people curbed by years of total war and half-crushed by austerity and gloom, showed that it had not lost the capacity for enjoying itself....Above all, the Festival made a spectacular setting as a showpiece for the inventiveness and genius of British scientists and technologists.\u000aThe Conservative Party restored its credibility on economic policy with the Industrial Charter written by Rab Butler, which emphasised the importance of removing unnecessary controls, while going far beyond the laissez-faire attitude of old towards industrial social problems. Churchill was party leader, but he brought in a Party Chairman to modernise the institution. Lord Woolton was a successful department store owner and wartime Minister of Food. As Party Chairman 1946\u201355, he rebuilt its local organisations with an emphasis on membership, money and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues. To broaden the base of potential candidates, the national party provided financial aid and assisted local organisations in raising local money. Lord Woolton emphasised a rhetoric that characterised the opponents as "Socialist" rather than "Labour." The libertarian influence of Professor Friedrich Hayek's 1944 best-seller Road to Serfdom was apparent in the younger generation, but that took another quarter century to have a policy impact. By 1951, Labour's factions were bitterly divided.\u000aThe Conservatives narrowly won the October 1951 election, although Labour got considerably more votes. Most of the new programmes passed by Labour were accepted by the Conservatives and became part of the "post war consensus" that lasted until the 1970s. The Conservatives ended rationing and reduced controls, and sold the famous Skylon for scrap. They were conciliatory towards unions and retained nationalisation and the welfare state, while privatising the steel and road haulage industries in 1953.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Golden age ===\u000aIn the 1950s, rebuilding continued, and immigrants from Commonwealth nations, mostly from the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent, began arriving in a steady flow. The shock of the Suez Crisis of 1956 made clear that Britain had lost its role as a superpower. It already knew it could no longer afford its large Empire. This led to decolonisation, and a withdrawal from almost all of its colonies by 1970.\u000aIn 1957 Prime Minister Macmillan boasted:\u000aLet us be frank about it: most of our people have never had it so good. Go round the country, go to the industrial towns, go to the farms and you will see a state of prosperity such as we have never had in my lifetime \u2013 nor indeed in the history of this country.\u000aUnemployment figures show that unemployment was significantly lower during the Golden Age than before or after:\u000aIn addition to superior economic performance, other social indexes were higher in the golden age; for example, the proportion of Britain's population saying they are "very happy" registered at 52% in 1957 bu fell to just 36% in 2005.\u000aThe 1950s and 1960s experienced continued modernisation of the economy. Representative was the construction of the first motorways. Britain maintained and increased its financial role in the world economy, and used the English language to promote its educational system to students from around the globe. With relatively low unemployment during this period, the standard of living continued to rise, with new private and council housing developments increasing and the number of slum properties diminishing.\u000aDuring the period, unemployment in Britain averaged only 2%. As prosperity returned after the war, Britons became more family-centred. Leisure activities became more accessible to more people. Holiday camps, which had first opened in the 1930s, became popular holiday destinations in the 1950s \u2013 and people increasingly had the ability to pursue personal hobbies. The BBC's early television service was given a major boost in 1953 with the coronation of Elizabeth II, attracting a worldwide audience of twenty million, plus tens of millions more by radio. Many middle-class people bought televisions to view the event. In 1950 just 1% owned television sets; by 1965 25% did, and many more were rented. As austerity receded after 1950 and consumer demand kept growing, the Labour Party hurt itself by shunning consumerism as the antithesis of the socialism it demanded.\u000aSmall neighbourhood shops were increasingly replaced by chain stores and shopping centres. Cars were becoming a significant part of British life, with city-centre congestion and ribbon developments springing up along major roads. These problems led to the idea of a green belt to protect the countryside, which was at risk from development of new housing units.\u000aThe post-war period witnessed a dramatic rise in the average standard of living, with a 40% rise in average real wages from 1950 to 1965. Workers in traditionally poorly paid semi-skilled and unskilled occupations saw a particularly marked improvement in their wages and living standards. Consumption, became more equal, especially as the landed gentry was pressed to pay its taxes and had to reduce its level of consumption. The rise in wages spurred consumer spending to increase by about 20% during the period, while economic growth continued at about 3%. The last food rations were ended in 1954, along with hire-purchase controls. As a result of these changes, large numbers of the working classes were able to participate in the consumer market for the first time. The number one major purchase was a washing machine. Ownership jumped from 18 percent in 1955 to 29 percent in 1958 and 60 percent in 1966.\u000aVarious fringe benefits became more common. In 1955, 96% of manual labourers were entitled to two weeks' holiday with pay, compared with 61% in 1951. By the end of the 1950s, Britain had become one of the world's most affluent countries, and by the early Sixties, most Britons enjoyed a level of prosperity that had previously been the privilege of only a small minority. For the first time in decades, the young and unattached had spare cash for leisure, clothes and even luxuries. In 1959, Queen magazine declared that "Britain has launched into an age of unparalleled lavish living." Average wages were high while jobs were plentiful, and people saw their personal prosperity climb even higher. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan claimed that "the luxuries of the rich have become the necessities of the poor." As summed up by R. J. Unstead,\u000aOpportunities in life, if not equal, were distributed much more fairly than ever before and the weekly wage-earner, in particular, had gained standards of living that would have been almost unbelievable in the thirties.\u000aLabour historian Martin Pugh stated:\u000aKeynesian economic management enabled British workers to enjoy a golden age of full employment which, combined with a more relaxed attitude towards working mothers, led to the spread of the two-income family. Inflation was around 4 per cent, money wages rose from an average of £8 a week in 1951 to £15 a week by 1961, home-ownership spread from 35 per cent in 1939 to 47 per cent by 1966, and the relaxation of credit controls boosted the demand for consumer goods.\u000aBy 1963, 82% of all private households had a television, 72% a vacuum cleaner, 45% a washing machine, and 30% a refrigerator. John Burnett notes that ownership had spread down the social scale so that the gap between consumption by professional and manual workers had considerably narrowed. The provision of household amenities steadily improved in the late decades of the century. From 1971 to 1983, households having the sole use of a fixed bath or shower rose from 88% to 97%, and those with an internal WC from 87% to 97%. In addition, the number of households with central heating almost doubled during that same period, from 34% to 64%. By 1983, 94% of all households had a refrigerator, 81% a colour television, 80% a washing machine, 57% a deep freezer, and 28% a tumble-drier.\u000aFrom a European perspective, however, Britain was not keeping pace. Between 1950 and 1970, it was overtaken by most of the countries of the European Common Market in terms of telephones, refrigerators, television sets, cars and washing machines per household. Education grew, but not as fast as in rival nations. By the early 1980s, some 80% to 90% of school leavers in France and West Germany received vocational training, compared with 40% in the United Kingdom. By the mid-1980s, over 80% of pupils in the United States and West Germany and over 90% in Japan stayed in education until the age of eighteen, compared with barely 33% of British pupils. In 1987, only 35% of 16-18-year-olds were in full-time education or training, compared with 80% in the United States, 77% in Japan, 69% in France, and 49% in the United Kingdom.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1970s economic crises ===\u000a\u000aIn comparing economic prosperity (using gross national product per person), the British record was one of steady downward slippage from seventh place in 1950, to 12th in 1965, to 20th in 1975. Labour politician Richard Crossman, after visiting prosperous Canada, returned to England with a\u000asense of restriction, yes, even of decline, the old country always teetering on the edge of a crisis, trying to keep up appearances, with no confident vision of the future.\u000aEconomists provided four overlapping explanations. The "early start" theory said that Britain's rivals were doing so well because they were still moving large numbers of farm workers into more lucrative employment, which Britain had done in the 19th century. A second theory emphasised the "rejuvenation by defeat", whereby Germany and Japan had been forced to re-equip, rethink and restructure their economies. The third approach emphasised the drag of "imperial distractions", saying that responsibilities to its large empire handicapped the home economy, especially through defence spending, and economic aid. Finally, the theory of "institutional failure" stressed the negative roles of discontinuity, unpredictability, and class envy. The last theory blamed trade unions, public schools, and universities for perpetuating an elitist anti-industrial attitude.\u000aIn the 1970s the exuberance and the radicalism of the 1960s ebbed. Instead a mounting series of economic crises, including many trade union strikes, pushed the British economy further and further behind European and world growth. The result was a major political crisis, and a Winter of Discontent in the winter of 1978\u201379, when widespread strikes by public sector trade unions seriously inconvenienced and angered the public.<\u000aHistorians Alan Sked and Chris Cook summarise the general consensus of historians regarding Labour in power in the 1970s:\u000aIf Wilson's record as prime minister was soon felt to have been one of failure, that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by Callaghan's term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular modus vivendi with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing. It was little wonder, therefore, that Mrs. Thatcher resoundingly defeated it in 1979.\u000aBright spots included large deposits of oil that were found in the North Sea, allowing. Britain to become a major oil exporter to Europe in the era of the 1970s energy crisis.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Long term economic factors ===\u000aWhile economic historians concentrate on statistical parameters, cultural historians added to the list of factors to explain Britain's long-term relative economic decline. According to Peter Hennessy, these include:\u000aExcessive trade union power\u000aToo much nationalisation\u000aInsufficient entrepreneurship\u000aToo many wars, both hot and cold\u000aThe distraction of imperialism\u000aA feeble political class\u000aA weak civil service\u000aAn enduring aristocratic tradition disparaged management\u000aWeak vocational education at all levels\u000aSocial class rigidities interence wiith progress."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Northern Ireland and the Troubles ===\u000a\u000aIn the 1960s, moderate Unionist Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Terence O'Neill tried to reform the system and give a greater voice to Catholics, who comprised 40% of the population of Northern Ireland. His goals were blocked by militant Protestants led by Reverend Ian Paisley. The increasing pressures from nationalists for reform and from unionists for "No surrender" led to the appearance of the civil rights movement under figures such as John Hume and Austin Currie. Clashes escalated out of control, as the army could barely contain the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Ulster Defence Association. British leaders feared their withdrawal would lead to a "doomsday scenario", with widespread communal strife, followed by the mass exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees. London shut down Northern Ireland's parliament and began direct rule. By the 1990s, the failure of the IRA campaign to win mass public support or achieve its aim of a British withdrawal led to negotiations that in 1998 produced the 'Good Friday Agreement'. This won popular support and largely ended the most violent aspects of The Troubles.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Social and cultural forces ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Emergence of a youth culture ===\u000aStarting in the late 1960s the counterculture movement spread from the US like a wildfire. Bill Osgerby argues that:\u000athe counterculture's various strands developed from earlier artistic and political movements. On both sides of the Atlantic the 1950s "Beat Generation" had fused existentialist philosophy with jazz, poetry, literature, Eastern mysticism and drugs \u2013 themes that were all sustained in the 1960s counterculture.\u000aBritain did not experience the intense social turmoil produced in America by the Vietnam War and racial tensions. Nevertheless, British youth readily identified with their American counterparts' desire to cast off the older generation's social mores. Music was a powerful force. British groups and stars such as The Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and many others gained huge followings in the UK and around the world, leading young people to question convention in everything from clothing to the class system.\u000aThe antiwar movement in Britain closely collaborated with their American counterparts, moving from an emphasis on nuclear war with Russia, to support for insurgents in the Southeast Asian jungles.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Princess Diana ===\u000a\u000aDuring the summer of 1981, the nation's spirits were raised by the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. The ceremony reached a global TV audience of 750 million people. It restored the royal family to the headlines where they would become a permanent fixture in tabloids and celebrity gossip publications, as well as a major tourist attraction. Diana became what Tony Blair called the "People's Princess," an iconic national figure, rivalling or surpassing the Queen, until her divorce. Her accidental death brought an unprecedented spasm of grief and mourning. Her brother, the 9th Earl Spencer, captured her role:\u000a"Diana was the very essence of compassion, of duty, of style, of beauty. All over the world she was a symbol of selfless humanity. All over the world, a standard bearer for the rights of the truly downtrodden, a very British girl who transcended nationality. Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who proved in the last year that she needed no royal title to continue to generate her particular brand of magic.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Secularisation ===\u000aHistorians agree that in the late 1940s Britain was a Christian nation, with its religiosity reinforced by the wartime experience. Peter Forster found that in answering pollsters, the British reported an overwhelming belief in the truth of Christianity, a high respect for it, and a strong association between it and moral behaviour. Peter Hennessy argued that long-held attitudes did not stop change; by mid-century "Britain was still a Christian country only in a vague attitudinal sense, belief generally being more a residual husk than the kernel of conviction." Kenneth O. Morgan agreed, noting that "the Protestant churches, Anglican, and more especially non-conformist, all felt the pressure of falling numbers and of secular challenges....Even the drab Sabbath of Wales and Scotland was under some threat, with pressure for opening cinemas in Wales and golf-courses in Scotland."\u000aBrian Harrison reports that the forces of secularisation grew rapidly, and by the 1990s Protestantism was a shadow of its 1945 strength. Compared to Western Europe, Britain stood at the lower end of attendance at religious services, and near the top in people claiming "no religion". While 80% of Britons in 1950 said they were Christians, only 64% did so in 2000. Harrison states:\u000aBy every measure (number of churches, number of parish clergy, church attendance, Easter Day communicants, number of church marriages, membership as a proportion of the adult population) the Church of England was in decline after 1970. In 1985 there were only half as many parish clergy as in 1900.\u000aRoman Catholicism held up, thanks initially to immigration from Ireland and later from Poland. What had been tiny clusters of Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists grew enormously through immigration. \u000a\u000a\u000a==== Growth trends ====\u000aThe Muslim population of England and Wales was over 50 times larger in 2011 compared to 50 years before. Sophie Gilliat-Ray attributes the growth to "recent immigration, the growing birth rate, some conversion to Islam, and perhaps also an increased willingness to self-identify as 'Muslim' on account of the 'war on terror'."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Status of women ===\u000a\u000aThe 1950s was a bleak period for feminism. In the aftermath of World War II, a new emphasis was placed on companionate marriage and the nuclear family as a foundation of the new welfare state.\u000aIn 1951, the proportion of adult women who were (or had been) married was 75%; more specifically, 84.8% of women between the ages of 45 and 49 were married. At that time: \u201cmarriage was more popular than ever before.\u201d In 1953, a popular book of advice for women states: \u201cA happy marriage may be seen, not as a holy state or something to which a few may luckily attain, but rather as the best course, the simplest, and the easiest way of life for us all\u201d.\u000aWhile at the end of the war, childcare facilities were closed and assistance for working women became limited, the social reforms implemented by the new welfare state included family allowances meant to subsidise families, that is, to support women in their \u201ccapacity as wife and mother.\u201d Sue Bruley argues that \u201cthe progressive vision of the New Britain of 1945 was flawed by a fundamentally conservative view of women\u201d.\u000aWomen's commitment to companionate marriage was echoed by the popular media: films, radio and popular women's magazines. In the 1950s, women's magazines had considerable influence on forming opinion in all walks of life, including the attitude to women\u2019s employment.\u000aNevertheless, 1950s Britain moved to equal pay for teachers (1952) and for men and women in the civil service (1954), thanks to activists like Edith Summerskill. Barbara Caine argues: \u201cIronically here, as with the vote, success was sometimes the worst enemy of organised feminism, as the achievement of each goal brought to an end the campaign which had been organised around it, leaving nothing in its place.\u201d\u000aFeminist writers of the early postwar period, such as Alva Myrdal and Viola Klein, started to allow for the possibility that women should be able to combine home duties with outside employment. Feminism was strongly connected to social responsibility and involved the well-being of society as a whole. This often came at the cost of the liberation and personal fulfillment of self-declared feminists. Even those women who regarded themselves as feminists strongly endorsed prevailing ideas about the primacy of children\u2019s needs, as advocated, for example, by John Bowlby the head of the Children's Department at the Tavistock Clinic and by Donald Winnicott.\u000aEqual pay entered the agenda in the 1959 General Election, when the Labour Party's Manifesto proposed a charter of rights including 'the right to equal pay for equal work'. Polls in 1968-9 showed public opinion moving in favour of equal pay for equal work; nearly three-quarters of those polled favoured the principle. The Equal Pay Act 1970 was passed by a Labour government with Conservative support; it took effect in 1975. Women\u2019s wages for like work rose sharply from 64% in 1970 to 74% by 1980, then stalled because of high unemployment, and public-sector cuts that hit women working part-time.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Sexuality in 1960s and 1970s ====\u000aIn the 1960s the generations divided sharply regarding sexual freedoms demanded by youth that disrupted long-held norms.\u000aSexual morals changed rapidly. One notable event was the publication of D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover by Penguin Books in 1960. Although first printed in 1928, the release in 1960 of an inexpensive paperback prompted a court case. The prosecutor's question, "Would you want your wife or servants to read this book?" highlighted how far society had changed, and how little some people had noticed. The book was seen as one of the first events in a general relaxation of sexual attitudes. The national media, based in London with its more permissive social norms, led in explaining and exploring the new permissiveness.\u000aOther elements of the sexual revolution included the development of the contraceptive pill, Mary Quant's miniskirt and the partial decriminalisation of male homosexuality in 1967. The incidence of divorce and abortion rose along with a resurgence of the women's liberation movement, whose campaigning helped secure the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975.\u000aIrish Catholics, traditionally the most puritanical of the ethno-religious groups, eased up a little, especially as the membership disregarded the bishops' teaching that contraception was sinful.\u000aThe feminist movement drew inspiration primarily from the United States, and from the experience of left-wing British women experiencing discrimination by male activists. Efforts to form a national movement in the mid-1970s foundered on a bitter split between the (predominantly heterosexual) socialists, and the (predominantly lesbian) radicals. The most visible spokesperson was Germaine Greer, whose The Female Eunuch (1970) called on women to rebel against marriage and instead live in heterosexual communes. Paul Addison concludes that," in popular culture, feminism was generally treated as a bit of a joke."\u000aMargaret Thatcher received scant credit from feminists for breaking the ultimate glass ceiling, because she avoided feminism, and expressed a masculine persona.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Educational reform ===\u000a\u000aThe Education Act 1944 was an answer to surging social and educational demands created by the war and the widespread demands for social reform that approached utopianism. It was prepared by Conservative Rab Butler after wide consultation. The Act took effect in 1947 and created the modern split between primary education and secondary education at age 11; it also established the Tripartite System, consisting of grammar schools, secondary modern schools and secondary technical schools. Academically gifted students who passed an exam were able to attend a prestigious grammar school. Those who did not pass the selection test attended secondary modern schools or technical schools. The school leaving age was raised to 15. The elite system of public schools was practically unchanged. The new law was widely praised by Conservatives because it honoured religion and social hierarchy, by Labour because it opened new opportunities for the working class, and by the general public because it ended the fees they had to pay. The act became a permanent part of the Post-war consensus supported by the three major parties.\u000aWhile the new law formed a part of the widely accepted Post-war consensus agreed to in general by the major parties, one part generated controversy. Critics on the left attacked grammar schools as elitist because a student had to pass a test at age 11 to enroll. Defenders, mostly in the Conservative party, argued that grammar schools allowed pupils to obtain a good education through merit rather than through family income. By 1964 one in 10 students were in comprehensive schools that did not sort children at age 11. Labour education minister Anthony Crosland (from 1965) crusaded to speed up the process. When Thatcher became education minister in 1970, one in three schools were comprehensives; The proportion doubled by 1974, despite her efforts to resist the trend against grammar schools. By 1979, over 90 percent of the schools were comprehensives.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Higher education ====\u000a\u000aHigher education expanded dramatically. Provincial university colleges were upgraded as at Nottingham, Southampton and Exeter. By 1957, 21 universities operated. Expansion came even faster in the 1960s, with new universities such as Keele, East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Sussex and York \u2014 bringing the total to 46 in 1970. Specialisation allowed national centres of excellence to emerge in medicine at Edinburgh, engineering at Manchester, science at Imperial College London, and agriculture at Reading. Oxford and Cambridge, however, remained intellectually, culturally and politically dominant. They attracted top students from across the Commonwealth, but lost many of their best researchers to the United States, where salaries and research facilities were much more generous. Into the 1960s, student bodies remained largely middle and upper class in origins; the average enrollment was only 2600 in 1962. Every subsequent decade brought further expansion in numbers of institutions and students. Tuition fees were introduced in 1998, raised to £3,000 a year in 2006, and passed £9,000 a year by 2006. The tendency toward vocationalism and the decline in the humanities remained controversial, as well as a growing mindset among senior administrators that is preoccupied with marketing (rankings) and accountability.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Media ===\u000aFor the BBC the central postwar mission was to block threats from American private broadcasting and to continue John Reith\u2019s mission of cultural uplift. BBC remained a powerful force, despite the arrival of a private TV network in the 1950s. Newspaper barons had less political power after 1945. Stephen Koss explains that the decline was caused by structural shifts: the major Fleet Street papers became properties of large, diversified capital empires with more interest in profits than politics. The provincial press virtually collapsed, with only the Manchester Guardian playing a national role; in 1964 it relocated to London. Growing competition arose from non-political journalism and from other media such as the BBC; independent press lords emerged who were independent of the political parties.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Sport ===\u000a\u000aSpectator sports became increasingly fashionable in postwar Britain, as attendance soared across the board. Despite the omnipresent austerity, the government were very proud to host the 1948 Olympics, even though Britain's athletes won only three gold medals compared to 38 for the Americans. Budgets were tight and no new facilities were built. Athletes were given the same bonus rations as dockers and miners, 5,467 calories a day instead of the normal 2,600. Athletes were housed in existing accommodation. Male competitors stayed at nearby RAF and Army camps, while the women were housed in London dormitories. Sporting competitions were minimal during the war years, but by 1948, 40 million a year were watching football matches, 300,000 per week went to motorcycle speedways and half a million watched greyhound races. Cinemas were jammed and dance halls were filled. The great cricket hero Denis Compton was ultimately dominant; the Daily Telegraph reported he:\u000amade his run gaily and with a smile. His happy demeanour and his good looks completed a picture of the beau ideal of a sportsman. I doubt if any game at any period has thrown up anyone to match his popular appeal in the England of 1947-1949.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Football ====\u000a\u000aThe most popular sport in the UK became association football; Sheffield F.C., founded in 1857, is the world's oldest football club. The home nations all have separate national teams and domestic competitions, most notably England's Premier League and FA Cup, and the Scottish Premiership and Scottish Cup. Referred to as the "home of football" by the international governing body FIFA, England hosted and won the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The English Premier League (formed in 1992 by member clubs of the old Football League First Division) is the most-watched football league in the world. Its biggest clubs include Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur. Scotland's Celtic and Rangers also have a global fanbase.\u000aFootball in Britain is renowned for the intense rivalries between clubs and the passions of their supporters, which includes a tradition of football chants, such as, "You're Not Singing Any More" (or its variant "We Can See You Sneaking Out!"), sung by jubilant fans towards the opposition fans who have gone silent (or left early). Fans lined up for meat pies, burgers and chips. Football dropped its ban on floodlights in 1950, and night games attracted increasingly large crowds of fans \u2013 some of them unruly \u2014 as well as large television audiences. Architects were challenged to build ever-larger stadia, as "their cantilevered constructions dwarfing mean streets, supplanted the cathedral as symbol of the city's identity and aspirations, and the fixtures surpassed church festivals in their national impact."\u000a\u000a\u000a===== The British Disease: football hooliganism =====\u000a\u000aThe so-called "British Disease" was hooliganism at football fixtures. Rowdiness had been a characteristic for decades, but by the 1970s confrontations had escalated into violence against visiting fans, including violence at matches held in Europe. An in-depth study made in 1983 by High Court judge Sir Oliver Popplewell found that many hooligans held steady jobs; they dressed in the latest style, and planned their violence ahead of time as a recreation in itself, to which football was a mere background. They were not poor and were searching for an identity more lively than their mundane working environment. By the 1990s, hooliganism had been sharply reduced, thanks to the use of seating-only stadiums where each spectator had to remain in an assigned seat, better policing methods, and the use of closed-circuit television to identify troublemakers.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Other sports ====\u000aCricket is Britain's other historic sport, but it grew faster in the overseas empire, and increasingly immigrants comprised the ranks of top players and fan base. Tennis spread from upper-class estates into clubs in middle-class suburbs, where it became a woman's specialty. Women increasingly frequented gyms, which sprang up everywhere; by the mid-1990s they had one of six members were women. Middle-class men and women were rather more active than the working class. Scotland remains the headquarters of golf, many clubs opened up by 1910 and continue to operate. The number of golfers doubled In the 1950s from a half-million to a million, mostly men; the total reached 2.5 million by 2000.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Cinema ===\u000a\u000aThe United Kingdom has had a significant film industry for over a century. While film output peaked in 1936, the "golden age" of British cinema occurred in the 1940s, during which the directors David Lean, Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger, Carol Reed and Richard Attenborough produced their most highly acclaimed work. Many postwar British actors achieved international fame and critical success, including Maggie Smith, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Kate Winslet and Ben Kingsley. A handful of the films with the largest ever box office returns have been made in the United Kingdom, including the second and third highest-grossing film series (Harry Potter and James Bond).\u000aThe identity of the British industry, and its relationship with the much larger and richer cinema of the United States, has been the subject of debate. Film production in Britain has often been affected by attempts to compete with the American industry. The career of the producer Alexander Korda was marked by this objective, the Rank Organisation attempted to compete in the 1940s, and Goldcrest in the 1980s. Numerous British-born directors, including Alfred Hitchcock and Ridley Scott, and performers, such as Charlie Chaplin and Cary Grant, achieved success primarily through their work in Hollywood.\u000aIn 2009 British films grossed around $2 billion worldwide and achieved a market share of around 7% globally and 17% in the United Kingdom. UK box-office takings totalled £1.1 billion in 2012, with 172.5 million admissions.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Immigration ===\u000a\u000aAfter decades of low immigration, new arrivals became a significant factor after 1945. Immigration before 2000 was greatest from the former British Empire especially Ireland, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Caribbean, South Africa, Kenya and Hong Kong. Since 2000, large numbers have arrived from Europe and the Middle East. Of the 56,267,000 people in Britain in 1996, 52,942,000 were white. The other 3,307,000 represented diverse ethnic or racial origins: 875,000 were black; 1,639,000 were Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi; 126,000 were Chinese; 161,000 were other Asian; 506,000 were from other groups or were mixed.\u000aSome immigrants have come as asylum seekers, seeking protection as refugees under the United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention, or from member states of the European Union, exercising one of the European Union's Four Freedoms. Since the 1980s, however, Britain has become a leading proponent of European restrictionalism and has developed policies that tend to exclude asylum seekers from mainstream society. Dispersal policy was set up through the National Asylum Support Service programme so that asylum seekers were directed to urban areas that had available housing, although possibly because of a weak job market. While newly arrived asylum seekers and refugees had both skills and qualifications, they experienced high levels of unemployment, or else found mostly low-skilled jobs with low earnings. Public opinion in host areas turned against them.\u000aThe new immigrants generally entered tight-knit ethnic communities. For example, the new Irish arrivals became integrated within a working-class Irish Catholic environment that shaped their behaviour whilst maintaining a distinct ethnic identity in terms of religion, culture and Labour politics.\u000aSpouses form the largest single category of migrant settlement, especially Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi women. For them it is a matter of restoring domestic relations in a familiar family environment, with higher incomes, thus easing the strain on the immigration process.\u000aFertility rates among new immigrants were much higher than the British norm (reflecting the norms of the country of origin). However, rates dropped rapidly with the length of stay in Britain. For some ethnic groups fertility reached about the level of the UK national average (e.g., black Caribbean) or below it (e.g., Indian and Chinese). Only among Pakistani and Bangladeshi women have total fertility rates remained well above the national average, but even so they have shown a continuous decrease since the 1970s.\u000aEnoch Powell (1912 \u2013 1998), a Conservative Party MP, broke from the broad consensus supporting immigration in April 1968 to warn of long-term violence, unrest and internal discord should immigration continued from non-white areas. His speech foresaw "rivers of blood" and predicted that white "native" English citizens would be unable to access social services and be overwhelmed by foreign cultures. While political, social and cultural elites were harshly critical of Powell and he was removed from the Shadow Cabinet, Powell developed substantial public support.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Thatcher's Britain ==\u000a\u000aMargaret Thatcher was the dominant political force of the late 20th century, often compared to Churchill and David Lloyd George for her transformative agenda. She was Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990, and Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990. She was often called the "Iron Lady" for her uncompromising politics and leadership style.\u000aPolitical analyst Dennis Kavanagh concludes that the "Thatcher Government produced such a large number of far-reaching changes across much of the policy spectrum, that it passes 'reasonable' criteria of effectiveness, radicalism, and innovation."\u000aThe Labour party under James Callaghan (prime minister 1976\u201379) contested the May 1979 general election as unemployment passed the one-million mark and unions became more aggressive. The Conservatives used a highly effective poster created by advertisers Saatchi and Saatchi, showing a dole queue snaking into the distance, carrying the caption "Labour isn't working". Voters gave Conservatives 43.9% of the vote and 339 seats to Labour's 269, for an overall majority of 43 seats. Labour was weakened by the steady long-term decline in the proportion of manual workers in the electorate. Twice as many manual workers normally voted Labour as voted Conservative, but they now constituted only 56% of the electorate. When Harold Wilson won narrowly for Labour in 1964, they had accounted for 63%. Furthermore, they were beginning to turn against the trade unions \u2013 alienated, perhaps, by the difficulties of the winter of 1978\u20139. In contrast, Tory policies stressed wider home ownership, which Labour refused to match. Thatcher did best in districts where the economy was relatively strong and was weaker where it was contracting.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Thatcherism ===\u000a\u000aAs Prime Minister, she implemented policies focused on economic liberalism, using populism, and pragmatism, known as Thatcherism. Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Due to recession and high unemployment, Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned until the beginning of 1982, a few months before the Falklands War. The afterglow of her victory in that war produced a resounding victory at the polls. She won re-election in 1983.\u000aPrivatisation was an enduring legacy of Thatcherism; it was accepted by the later Labour administration of Tony Blair. Her policy was to privatise nationalised corporations (such as telephone and aerospace firms). She sold public housing to tenants, all on favourable terms. The policy developed an important electoral dimension during the second Thatcher government (1983\u201390). It involved more than denationalisation: wider share ownership was the second plank of the policy. Thatcher advocated an "enterprise society" in Britain, especially in widespread share-ownership, personal ownership of council houses, marginalization of trade unions and expansion of private health care. These policies transformed many aspects of British society.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Foreign policy ===\u000aThatcher was distrustful of the European Union and did not try to forge closer relations. Her major breakthrough in foreign policy came in the dramatic long-distance war against Argentina for control of the Falkland Islands. Thatcher played a role in ending the Cold War. When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, she provided support for U.S. President Jimmy Carter's aggressive responses, such as the 1980 Olympic boycott. However, Britain's precarious economic situation allowed only tepid backing to Carter's attempt to punish Moscow through economic sanctions. She collaborated closely with Ronald Reagan in confronting the Soviets. She was the first major western leader to identify Mikhail Gorbachev as a potential negotiating partner. She was annoyed by Reagan's invasion of Grenada (a member of the Commonwealth), and lukewarm support regarding the Falklands.\u000aThatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987. During this period her support for a Community Charge (popularly referred to as "poll tax") was widely unpopular and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She lost the support of Conservative party leaders and had to resign as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Cultural movements ===\u000aEnvironmentalism is a major public issue was brought to the forefront by Prime Minister Thatcher in 1988, Which included a warning about climate change. The environmentalism movements of the 1980s reduced the emphasis on intensive farming, and promoted organic farming and conservation of the countryside.\u000aProtestant religious observance declined notably in Britain during the second half of the 20th century. Catholicism (based on the Irish elements) held its own, while Islam grew rapidly. Church of England attendance particularly dropped, although charismatic churches like Elim and AOG grew. The movement to Keep Sunday Special seemed to have lost at the beginning of the 21st century.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Economic change ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Household prosperity ====\u000aFrom 1964 up until 1996, income per head doubled, while ownership of various household goods significantly increased. By 1996, two-thirds of households owned cars, 82% had central heating, most people owned a VCR, and one in five houses had a home computer. In 1971, 9% of households had no access to a shower or bathroom, compared with only 1% in 1990; largely due to demolition or modernisation of older properties that lacked such facilities. In 1971, only 35% had central heating, while 78% enjoyed this amenity in 1990. By 1990, 93% of households had colour television, 87% had telephones, 86% had washing machines, 80% had deep-freezers, 60% had video-recorders and 47% had microwave ovens. Holiday entitlements became more generous. In 1990, nine out of ten full-time manual workers were entitled to more than four weeks of paid holiday a year, while twenty years previously only two-thirds had been allowed three weeks or more. The post-war period also witnessed significant improvements in housing conditions. In 1960, 14% of British households had no inside toilet, while in 1967 22% of all homes had no basic hot water supply. By the Nineties, however almost all homes had these amenities together with central heating, which had been a luxury just two decades earlier.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Troubles of 1970s and after ====\u000a\u000a\u000a===== Deindustrialization =====\u000aAfter 1960 British industries were troubled. The railways were decrepit, more textile mills closed than opened, steel employment fell sharply and the automobile industry practically disappeared, apart from some luxury models. Deindustrialization meant the closure of many operations in mining, heavy industry and manufacturing, with the resulting loss of high paid working-class jobs. A certain amount of turnover had always taken place, with newer businesses replacing older ones. However, the 1970s were different, with a worldwide energy crisis and a dramatic influx of low-cost manufactured goods from Asia leading to more closures and fewer openings. Major sectors were hit hard between 1966 and 1982, with a 60 per cent decline in textiles, 53 per cent in metal manufacture, 43 per cent in mining, 38 per cent in construction, and 35 per cent in vehicles. Coal mining quickly collapsed and practically disappeared in the 21st century. The consumption of coal\u2014mostly for electricity\u2014plunged from 157 million tonnes in 1970 to 37 million tonnes in 2015, nearly all of it imported. Coal mining jobs fell from a peak of 1,191,000 in 1920 to 695,000 in 1956, 247,000 in 1976, 44,000 in 1993 to 2,000 in 2015. In the 1970s, manufacturing accounted for 25 percent of the economy. Total employment in manufacturing fell from 7.1 million in 1979 to 4.5 million in 1992 and only 2.7 million in 2016, when it accounted for 10% of the economy.\u000aIn Scotland deindustrialization took place rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, as most of the traditional industries drastically shrank or completely closed. A new service-oriented economy emerged to replace them. Scotland's shipyards in 1954 built 12 percent of the world's tonnage, falling to 1 percent in 1968. North Sea oil created a major new industry after 1970, and some older firms successfully took advantage of the opportunity. John Brown & Company's shipyard at Clydebank transformed itself from a traditional shipbuilding business to a factor in the high technology offshore oil and gas drilling industry.\u000aPopular response varied. Some nostalgically invoked a glorious industrial past or the bygone British Empire to cope with their newfound personal economic insecurity. Others looked to the EU for help. Some turned to exclusionary Englishness as the solution to current grievances. By the 21st century, enough grievances had accumulated to have a political impact. The United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), based in white working-class towns, increased its vote share while warning against the dangers of immigration. The political reverberations came to a head in the shocking and unexpected popular vote in favour of leaving the EU in 2016.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Deregulation ====\u000aThatcher's deregulation of the economy ended the post-war consensus about the planned economy. She was elected at a time of crises between the Labour Party and the trade unions, and a strong trend of higher unemployment and deindustrialisation. She also liberalised stock markets and privatized state-owned enterprises. Inflation fell and trade union power was reduced.\u000aThe National Union of Mineworkers had long been one of the strongest trade unions. Its strikes had toppled governments in the 1970s. Thatcher drew the line and defeated it in the bitterly fought miners' strike of 1984\u20131985. The basic problem was that the easy coal had all been mined and what was left was very expensive. The miners, however, were fighting not just for high wages but for a way of life that had to continue had to be subsidised by other workers. The Union split. In the end almost all the mines were shut down. Britain turned to its vast reserves of North Sea gas and oil, which brought in substantial tax and export revenues, to fuel a new economic boom.\u000aAfter the economic boom of the 1980s, a brief but severe recession occurred between 1990 and 1992 following the economic chaos of Black Wednesday under the government of Conservative John Major, who had succeeded Thatcher in 1990. However the rest of the 1990s saw the beginning of a period of continuous economic growth that lasted over 16 years and was greatly expanded under Blair's New Labour government following his landslide election victory in 1997, with a rejuvenated party abandoning its commitment to policies including nuclear disarmament and nationalisation of key industries, and no reversal of the Thatcher-led union reforms.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Europe ===\u000aBritain's wish to join the Common Market (as the European Economic Community was known in Britain) was first expressed in July 1961 by the Macmillan government, was negotiated by Edward Heath as Lord Privy Seal, but was vetoed in 1963 by French President Charles de Gaulle. After initially hesitating over the issue, Wilson lodged a second application (in May 1967) to join the European Community, as it was then called. Like the first, though, it was vetoed by de Gaulle.\u000aIn 1973, as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister, Heath negotiated terms for admission and Britain finally joined the Community in 1973. In opposition, the Labour Party was deeply divided, though Wilson remained in favour. In the 1974 General Election, the Labour Party manifesto included a pledge to renegotiate terms for Britain's membership and then hold a referendum on whether to stay in the EC on the new terms. This was a constitutional procedure without precedent in British history. In the subsequent referendum campaign, rather than the normal British tradition of "collective responsibility", under which the government takes a policy position which all cabinet members are required to support publicly, members of the Government (and the Conservative opposition) were free to present their views on either side of the question. A referendum was duly held on 5 June 1975, and the proposition to continue membership was passed with a substantial majority.\u000aThe Single European Act (SEA) was the first major revision of the 1957 Treaty of Rome. In 1987, Thatcher's enacted it into UK law.\u000aThe Maastricht Treaty transformed the European Community into the European Union. In 1992, the Conservative government under John Major ratified it, against the opposition of his backbench Maastricht Rebels.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Devolution for Scotland and Wales ===\u000a\u000aOn 11 September 1997 (on the 700th anniversary of the Scottish victory over the English at the Battle of Stirling Bridge) a referendum was held on devolving substantial power to a Scottish Parliament. Voters overwhelmingly voted to establish the parliament and grant it limited taxation powers. Two weeks later, a referendum on establishing a Welsh Assembly was also approved, by a narrow majority. The first elections were held, and these bodies began to operate, in 1999. The creation of these bodies widened the differences between regions, especially in areas such as healthcare.\u000a\u000a\u000a== 1997- ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Tony Blair and New Labour ===\u000a\u000aTony Blair became the leader of the Labour Party in 1994, and three times was elected Prime Minister (1997\u20132007). With Gordon Brown he founded the movement known as New Labour. He was known internationally for his responsibility for British participation in the conflicts in Kosovo, Afghanistan and (amid substantial controversy) Iraq. The coalition of the US, UK and other countries initially failed to quell a substantial insurgency that reemerged when coalition forces withdrew in 2011. By 2010 only 12% of Britons considered the Iraq war to have been a success.\u000aBlair sought to modernise Britain's public services, encourage enterprise and innovation in its private sector and keep its economy open to international commerce. The North Irish, Scottish and Welsh devolutions took place under his administration.\u000aKavanagh argues that by the 1980s, left-wing or socialist tendencies in the Labour Party divided the party and united its enemies:\u000aLabour voters are not attracted by many "socialist" policies, that is greater public ownership, comprehensive education, extending trade union rights, and redistribution. Such policies appear to unite supporters of other parties in rejection well serving to divide Labour voters.\u000aBlair moved the Labour Party in new directions, minimising the left-wing or socialists factions. He thereby broadened the appeal to middle-class and professional voters.\u000aBlair was also anxious to escape from the Labour party's reputation for "tax-and-spend" domestic policies; he wanted instead to establish a reputation for fiscal prudence. He had undertaken in general terms to modernise the welfare state, but he had avoided undertaking to reduce poverty, achieve full employment, or reverse the increase in inequality that had occurred during the Thatcher administration. Once in office, however, his government launched a package of social policies designed to reduce unemployment and poverty. The commitment to modernise the welfare state was tackled by the introduction of "welfare to work" programmes to motivate the unemployed to return to work instead of drawing benefit. Poverty reduction programmes were targeted at specific groups, including children and the elderly, and took the form of what were termed "New Deals". There were also new tax credit allowances for low-income and single-parent families with children, and "Sure Start" progammes for under-fours in deprived areas. A "National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal" was launched in 2001 with the objective of ensuring that "within 10 to 20 years no-one should be seriously disadvantaged by where they live"; a "Social Exclusion Unit" was set up, and annual progress reports concerning the reduction of poverty and social exclusion were commissioned.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Brown as Prime Minister ===\u000a\u000aChancellor Gordon Brown replaced Blair as Prime Minister in 2007. After initial rises in opinion polls Labour's popularity declined with the onset of a worldwide recession in 2008, leading to poor results in local European elections in 2009. A year later, Labour lost 91 seats in the House of Commons at the 2010 general election, the party's biggest loss of seats in a single general election since 1931. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by David Cameron, and as Leader of the Labour Party by Ed Miliband.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Conservatives return ===\u000a\u000aThe economic damage done by the Great Recession weakened Labour and facilitated a Conservative come-back. Prime Minister David Cameron (2010-2016) sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position. The 2010 general election led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with the much smaller party of Liberal Democrats. His premiership was marked by the ongoing negative economic effects of the late-2000s worldwide financial crisis. He faced a large deficit in government finances that he sought to reduce through austerity measures. His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare, immigration policy, education, and healthcare. His government privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets, and legalised same-sex marriage. He won an easy reelection in 2015 with 330 seats in Commons against 296.\u000aCameron resigned as Prime Minister the following year after the British public voted to leave the European Union in a national referendum, with his government having campaigned for the opposing 'remain' side. He was succeeded by former Home Secretary Theresa May, who called another general election in the summer of 2017, resulting in a hung parliament.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Economic growth and crises since 1995 ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Housing ===\u000a\u000aHouse prices tripled in the 20 years between 1995 and 2015. Growth was almost continuous during the period, save for a two-year period of decline around 2008 as a result of the banking crisis. The gap between income and house prices has changed in the last 20 years such that even in the most affordable regions of England and Wales buyers have to spend six times their income. It was most marked in London, where in 2013 the £300,000, median house price costs 12 times the median London income of £24,600.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Brexit ===\u000a\u000aEconomic and social issues caused political unrest, particularly in areas hurt by deindustrialization and globalization of the economy. The UK Independence Party (UKIP), a Eurosceptic political party, 1993. It rose to prominence after 2000, winning third place in the 2004 European elections, second place in the 2009 European elections and first place in the 2014 European elections, with 27.5% of the total vote. Cameron won reelection in 2015 in part by promising a referendum on the EU, which he expected would easily defeat Brexit.\u000aUnexpectedly the 'Leave' pro-Brexit campaign waxed strong primarily on issues relating to sovereignty and migration, whereas the remain campaign focused on the economic impacts of leaving the EU. Polls showed more cited both the EU (32%) and migration (48%) as important issues than cited the economy (27%).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Historiography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Post-war consensus ===\u000a\u000aThe post-war consensus is a historians' model of political agreement from 1945 to 1979, when newly elected Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher rejected and reversed it. . The concept claims there was a widespread consensus that covered support for a coherent package of policies that were developed in the 1930s, promised during the Second World War, and enacted under Attlee. The policies dealt with a mixed economy, Keynesianism, and a broad welfare state. In recent years the validity of the interpretation has been debated by historians.\u000aThe historians' model of the post-war consensus was most fully developed by Paul Addison. The basic argument is that in the 1930s Liberal Party intellectuals led by John Maynard Keynes and William Beveridge developed a series of plans that became especially attractive as the wartime government promised a much better post-war Britain and saw the need to engage every sector of society. The coalition government during the war, headed by Churchill and Attlee, signed off on a series of white papers that promised Britain a much improved welfare state. After the war. The promises included the national health service, and expansion of education, housing, and a number of welfare programmes. It did not include the nationalisation of all industries, which was a Labour Party design. The Labour Party did not challenge the system of elite public schools\u2014They became part of the consensus, as did comprehensive schools. Nor did Labour challenge the primacy of Oxford and Cambridge. However, the consensus did call for building many new universities to dramatically broaden educational base of society. Conservatives did not challenge the socialised medicine of the National Health Service; indeed, they boasted they could do better job of running it. In foreign policy, the consensus called for an anti-Communist Cold War policy, decolonisation, close ties to NATO, the United States, and the Commonwealth, and slowly emerging ties to the European Community.\u000aThe model states that from 1945 until the arrival of Thatcher in 1979, there was a broad multi-partisan national consensus on social and economic policy, especially regarding the welfare state, nationalised health services, educational reform, a mixed economy, government regulation, Keynesian macroeconomic policies, and full employment. Apart from the question of nationalisation of some industries, these policies were broadly accepted by the three major parties, as well as by industry, the financial community and the labour movement. Until the 1980s, historians generally agreed on the existence and importance of the consensus. Some historians such as Ralph Miliband expressed disappointment that the consensus was a modest or even conservative package that blocked a fully socialised society. Historian Angus Calder complained bitterly that the post-war reforms were an inadequate reward for the wartime sacrifices, and a cynical betrayal of the people's hope for a more just post-war society. In recent years, there has been a historiographical debate on whether such a consensus ever existed.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aSocial history of England § Since 1945\u000aThe Spirit of '45, a 2013 documentary film\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aAddison, Paul (2010).

aVMaccabi "Zvi" Yavne (Hebrew: \u05de\u05db\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d1\u05e0\u05d4\u200e) is an Israeli football club based in Yavne. They currently play in Liga Alef.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe club was founded in 1962 and played in Liga Gimel, the lowest tier of Israeli football, up until the 1971\u201372 season, when they started their progress and reached Liga Bet for the first time. In the 1975\u201376 season, they won Liga Bet South B division and were promoted to Liga Alef. Four seasons later, in the 1979\u201380 season, they won Liga Alef South division and were promoted to Liga Artzit, the second tier of Israeli football at the time. After 9th-place finish in their debut season in the second tier, they finished 3rd in the 1981\u201382 season and were promoted to Liga Leumit (then the top division) for the first time in their history. In 1985 they won the Toto Cup, beating Beitar Jerusalem 2\u20131 in the final. After several lower-mid table finishes, Maccabi were relegated at the end of the 1986\u201387 season in which they finished 14th.\u000aMaccabi narrowly missed out a return to the top division, on goal difference, in 1989\u201390, when they finished third, level on points with second-placed Hapoel Tel Aviv. In the following season they were promoted, but were relegated at the end of the 1991\u201392 season, having finished second bottom.\u000aAfter a narrow escape in the 1996\u201397 season, in which they finished one place and one point above the relegation zone, Maccabi were relegated to Liga Alef (then the third tier) at the end of the 1997\u201398 season, in which they won only one match and gained eight points throughout the entire season. Due to league restructuring, at the end of the following season, they dropped into the fourth tier.\u000aIn 2000\u201301 Maccabi won the South Division of Liga Alef and were promoted back to Liga Artzit. However, they finished bottom of the league in 2001\u201302 and were relegated back to Liga Alef. At the end of the 2011\u201312 season, Maccabi beat Hapoel Asi Gilboa on away goals (2\u20132 on aggregate) in the promotion playoff final and were promoted to Liga Leumit. In the 2015\u201316 season, the club finished second bottom in Liga Leumit and relegated to Liga Alef.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Current squad ==\u000aAs of 20 January 2018\u000a\u000a\u000a== Honours ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Cups ===\u000aToto Cup\u000aWinners 1984\u201385\u000a\u000a\u000a=== League ===\u000aSecond Division:\u000aRunners-up 1988\u201389, 1990\u201391\u000a\u000aThird Division:\u000aChampions 1975\u201376, 1979\u201380, 2011\u201312\u000aRunners-up 1972\u201373, 1973\u201374, 1974\u201375, 1976\u201377\u000a\u000aFourth Division:\u000aChampions 1970\u201371, 2000\u201301\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aMaccabi Yavne Israel Football Association (in Hebrew)

aVThe Scouting 2007 Centenary comprised celebrations around the world in which Scouts celebrated 100 years of the world Scout movement. The original celebrations were focused on the United Kingdom, such as the camp on Brownsea Island, the birthplace of Scouting, and the 21st World Scout Jamboree in Chelmsford, Essex.\u000aNational Scout movements added extra celebrations in amongst the international ones, including the Australian Scout Jamboree held 1\u201313 January 2007 at Elmore, Victoria, Australia, and KanderJam at the Kandersteg International Scout Centre in Switzerland.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Global activities ==\u000a\u000aThe Centenary celebrations began on 1 January 2007, and members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) were encouraged to start their programme on that day, and continue right through the year. In London, there was a New Years Day Parade of Scouts. In towns, flags were flown to celebrate Scouting. Europa postage stamps were issued monthly throughout 2007 for the celebration.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Scout and Guide Spirit Flame ===\u000aOn 22 February 2007, the 150th anniversary of Robert Baden-Powell's birth, a torch was lit at his grave in Nyeri, Kenya. Several thousand Scouts and Guides from around the world attended the ceremony that included a procession from Baden-Powell's old home nearby.\u000aThe flame was carried by Scouts and Guides through Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt, Greece, Italy, France, Belgium and finally the UK to arrive on Brownsea Island, UK on the eve of Scouting's Sunrise. The spirit flame was brought to Brownsea Island via Sea Scouts that rowed a small boat across Poole Harbour. After the Sunrise celebrations on 1 August 2007. the flame continued onwards to the 21st World Scout Jamboree.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Sunrise ceremony ===\u000a\u000aThe first Scout Camp opened on 1 August 1907 by the Movement's founder General Baden-Powell. At 8am, he blew a kudu horn to gather round the 20 boys that were on the island for that camp. Exactly one hundred years later, around 400,000 Scouts in the UK took part in an event to commemorate this. On Brownsea Island, a Scout read out Baden-Powell's words of 100 years ago, calling for peace, comradeship and co-operation. Members of Scout associations worldwide renewed their promise at 8am local time; and Scout troops organised a "good turn" in aid of their local communities. Additionally, at 8am Western European Summer Time, Scouts internationally used the Internet to celebrate and communicate with Scouts on Brownsea Island as part of the World Scout Jamboree. Scout groups turned the event into a day-long celebration.\u000aA flame that traveled from Africa was used to light a campfire that burned through the night, marking the passing of the first 100 years of the Scout movement.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== World Jamboree 2007 ===\u000a\u000aThe 21st World Scout Jamboree was the main event of the year, with more than 40,000 young people from around the world taking part in a 12\u2011day event in Chelmsford in the south of England. The event started on 27 July 2007, where the camping participants celebrated the Scouting Sunrise in one place. While this is not the largest encampment of Scouts ever held (over 50,000 young Scouts camped in Birkenhead at the Coming of Age Jamboree in 1929), it is expected that the large numbers of day visitors and the concurrent camps around the world made this jamboree the largest Scouting event since the movement started 100 years earlier.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Brownsea Island camps ===\u000aThere were several camps on the famous birthplace of Scouting, including a Sunrise Camp, a Replica Camp, and a New Centenary Camp. The replica camp was held twice, each 4.5 days camping running around the August celebrations. The activities included historical 1907 activities, several with a modern twist. The first of the replica camp's was for purely Boy Scouts and the second included a patrol of girls. As well as Scouts there were boys from the Boys Brigade, as in the original 1907 camp. The changes made to the modern Brownsea Camp did not always draw positive attention in the media, some reports suggesting that elements of the original spirit of Scouting had been lost.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Activities by national Scout organisations ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Scouts Australia ===\u000a\u000aScouts and Scouting supporters in Australia gathered at public venues to celebrate the Dawn of the New Scouting Centenary. In Canberra, Australia's capital, local Scouts joined the Chief Scout of Australia to renew their Scout Promise in a commitment of world peace and social betterment. Other events occurred in Sydney at the Opera House and in Melbourne.\u000aDuring 2005 and 2006, Australian Rovers developed the Centenary of Scouting Peace Boomerang which completed a journey of over 18,000 km around Australia spreading a message of peace and unity leading up to the Centenary. Australian Rovers developed the boomerang as a Gift for Peace project that would involve Rovers, Scouts and the general public, and raise awareness and generate discussions amongst young people about peace. The boomerang, an Australian Aboriginal wooden ceremonial tool, returns to the person who throws it, making it a fitting symbol as it traveled for 18 months around Australia.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Guidisme et Scoutisme en Belgique (Belgium)-JAMbe ===\u000aOn 28 and 29 April 2007, 95,000 members from the five Belgian Scout and Guide associations gathered in Brussels to celebrate. The final show was attended by the Belgian crown prince, Prince Filip, who was a Scouting member in his younger days. They had to play the show twice because King Baudouin Stadium has a capacity of only 50,000 people. This was the biggest gathering (in numbers at one day) of any of the festivities anywhere held by Scouting.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Scouts Canada-11th Canadian Scout Jamboree ===\u000aThe 11th Canadian Scout Jamboree (CJ'07) was held from 25 July 2007 to 1 August 2007 at Tamaracouta Scout Reserve just north of Montreal. On 1 August there was a sunrise ceremony commemorating the first 100 years of Scouting.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Asociación Scouts de Colombia-National Centenary Gathering ===\u000aAbout 5.000 Colombian Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Rovers gathered in the Simón Bolívar National Park, in the heart of Bogotá, Capital City of Colombia, in the National Rally "Mapialsancla: A trip to the Fantastic dreams world", the National Jamboree "Sliders Live100Scout", and the National Rover Moot "Challenge Colombia". The participation of many young people who took Bogotá for 7 days with fun and varied activities for celebrating the centenary of World Scouting.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Scouts et Guides de France-Sunrise Ceremony on Mont Blanc ===\u000aA team of Scouts and Guides from the Savoie districts celebrated Scouting Sunrise from the peak of Mont Blanc. Eduardo Missoni, Secretary General of WOSM, visited the team's first preparatory weekend and presented them with a flag to take to the summit. Guillaume Légaut, president of Scouts et Guides de France is participating in the expedition.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Federação Escotista de Portugal-Acanac ===\u000aIn Portugal, a one-week Acanac ('acampamento nacional, meaning 'national camp') was held where Scout troops from Portugal got together to celebrate the 100 years of Scouting worldwide. They also celebrated the sunrise ceremony.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Swiss Guide and Scout Movement-Igloo village and KanderJam ===\u000a\u000aOn 17 and 18 March 2007, Swiss Scouts planned to build an igloo village with each construction representing one of the member countries and territories of WOSM. The event was held on the glacier of the Plaine Morte near the resort of Crans-Montana, in Switzerland. A total of 130 igloos were built, short of the planned number, but this still beat the previous world record of 100 igloos. Additionally, every team composed a message of peace for the Scout organisation represented by their igloo. These letters will be sent including a photo of the igloo village taken at night-fall, when the igloos were illuminated by torches laid out in the snow spelling out the word peace. The public was encouraged to attend the event, in order to show how igloos are made and to involve them in the construction.\u000aA large gathering of Scouts from forty countries took place at Kandersteg International Scout Centre, the Scout centre run by the World Organization of Scouting Movement. Having taken place at the same time as the world jamboree, 1,800 guests stayed at the centre where on 1 August 2008 Scouts from around the world celebrated the Scouting's Sunrise and Swiss National Day at Oeschinensee, overlooking the town of Kandersteg, high in the Swiss Alps.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The Scout Association of the United Kingdom ===\u000aDespite hosting a large number of international centenary events, including the World Jamboree, a large number of county and district level events were also organised by members of The Scout Association.\u000aScottish Scouting ran a set of 12 camps open to members of the Explorer Section in the UK. These camps' themes ranged from activity camps to Young Leaders courses.\u000aHampshire Scout County organised H007, held at New Park near Brockenhurst, with over 8,000 Scouts in attendance. Amongst the range of activities, the camp hosted members of the British Army and Royal Navy.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Baden-Powell Scouts' Association (United Kingdom) ===\u000aThe Baden-Powell Scouts' Association celebrated the Centenary of Scouting by issuing commemorative badges and holding their own Centenary Camp in Southampton.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other activities ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Gifts for Peace ===\u000aDuring the 36th World Scout Conference, it was decided that each National Scout Organisation would present a Gift for Peace during 2007. This Gift is expected to be the culmination of work by young people in Scouting over the previous year.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Maize maze ===\u000aBritish farmer Nick Lees and his family created a maze in a 10 acre maize field in the shape of Baden-Powell and a Scouting logo. The maze was open to the public until September 2007, when the maize was harvested. Due to mediocre weather, the maize did not fully reach the expected height of 4.5 m. The maze was at Bickleigh, near Tiverton, Devon.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a21st World Scout Jamboree\u000aBrownsea Island Scout camp\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aThe Scout Association (UK) Interactive map of Centenary Events.\u000a21st World Scout Jamboree English Homepage\u000aCentenary celebration at Ardington Stone Circle, England\u000aScouting 2007 Centenary English Homepage\u000aBaden-Powell statue on Poole Quay to celebrate the centenary of the first ever scout camp on Brownsea Island\u000a12 Camps of 2007\u000aScout and Guide Spirit Flame website\u000aIn Pictures: Scouting centenary\u000aScouting Sunrise Kanderjam

aVJerson Ravelo (born July 30, 1977 in San Cristobal) is a boxer from the Dominican Republic, who represented his native country at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney in the Men's 75 kg Division.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal ==\u000aRavelo currently resides in Newark, New Jersey, with his son Jerson Jr. While many fighters pressure their children, particularly their namesakes, into following their fistic footsteps, Ravelo doesn't want that for his son.\u000a"I'm doing this for my son and my family. As of right now, he doesn't even show no interest in boxing, which is good."\u000aRavelo's favorite fighter is Roy Jones Jr. "The way he fights, the things that he's done are incredible" says Ravelo. "A lot of people don't give him credit. They talk about he never fought anybody, but like he said in his song, he just made them look like nobodies."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Amateur career ==\u000aRavelo was the 1998 National Golden Gloves Middleweight champion. Ravelo also represented the Dominican Republic as a Middleweight at the 2000 Sydney Olympic games, he was eliminated in the opening round by Paul Miller of Australia, on an 8-7 decision.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Professional career ==\u000aUpon turning professional, Ravelo signed a promotional deal with Lou Dibella's Dibella Entertainment. He made his debut as a professional on January 27, 2001, in Madison Square Garden in New York City, where he defeated America's Miguel Gutierrez. He became the first 2000 Olympian to reach double digit wins as a pro. In 2004 Ravelo was upset by David Alfonso Lopez by TKO.\u000aRavelo says, "Before that fight I didn't want to fight anymore. I didn't have no confidence because that was prior to me getting the surgeries and that was when I was coming back. It helped me come back to get my confidence back up and come back to reality. Before that fight, I was walking on a cloud."\u000aNumerous injuries to his back and right hand hampered his career, and he didn't see any action in the year 2005 as a result. In that time period, things soured with Jerson's promotional situation. The contract contained a clause stating that if Jerson was injured for over a year, Dibella Entertainment could terminate the contract. Ravelo was subsequently released by Dibella.\u000a"Once a fighter has back problems", says Ravelo, "he's always going to have back problems. I can go 6 months, a year without feeling my back at all. But I can wake up one day and for a week my back will be hurting me."\u000aIn 2006, Jerson signed a promotional contract with The Contender Group. "They care about their fighters," Ravelo said. "They're not trying to make a quick buck out of a fighter, they're looking long term." Returning from substantial layoffs, Ravelo reeled off three consecutive first round knockouts.\u000aThe next order of business was a showdown with then-undefeated Allan Green of Tulsa, Oklahoma on October 14, 2006. Jerson was stopped in the eighth round. In that fight, Ravelo suffered another injury to his right hand.\u000aRavelo rebounded in 2007 with a unanimous decision over England's Paul Buchannan, whom he knocked down in the third round. That fight was a part of The Contender's USA versus UK special.\u000aRavelo has gone through a who's who of trainers in his career, including Mark Breland, Tommy Brooks, Tommy Parks, Charles Murray, Anthony Ham, Bouie Fischer and Oscar Suarez. He is currently trained by Nettles Nasser, who also guides Henry Crawford and Omar Sheika.\u000aOf Nasser, Ravelo says, "He's a good trainer. He teaches the right things. He tells you what to do. He motivates his fighters. I know he don't get a lot of credit because he's young. I think he's one of the better coaches out there."\u000aRavelo's current record stands at 18-2 (12 KO).\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aProfessional boxing record for Jerson Ravelo from BoxRec\u000aOfficial Jerson Ravelo Myspace Page\u000aInterview

aVBon Air is a neighborhood in the south portion of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. Its two zip codes are 15226 and 15210, and it is represented in the Pittsburgh City Council by the council member for District 4 (South Neighborhoods).\u000aBon Air is small in geographic size compared to the other communities in District 4, but its reputation, "Country living in the City" is well deserved by its terrain. Bon Air is on a mountaintop, surrounded almost entirely by steep forested mountainsides. Road access to Bon Air is limited by only two connecting streets to the Knoxville neighborhood to the east. North of Bon Air is McKinley Park, with a 120-foot drop down to Bausman Avenue, to the west another drop down to Route 51. South is a precipitous drop down to a low forested valley and east a drop down into a large cemetery. One of the most isolated neighborhoods of the City of Pittsburgh, still it is only minutes away from Downtown and Oakland by public transportation and affords its residents the benefits of residing in a leafy "suburban" setting and all that city life provides. Bon Air is well-served by its own "T" (light-rail) stop from which residents can be in Downtown Pittsburgh in mere minutes and is also the terminus of the 54 Bus that travels directly to the Oakland neighborhood.\u000aThe neighborhood is a balanced mix of families, single persons, and senior citizens. There is no commercial zoning on the Bon Air mountaintop, all the residences are single family homes, usually with superb views. A small parklet on the mountaintop is excellent for young children.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Surrounding neighborhoods ==\u000aBon Air has six Pittsburgh neighborhood borders, including Beltzhoover to the north, Knoxville to the upper east, Carrick to the east and south, Brookline to the south and west, and Beechview and Mount Washington to the northwest. With the exception of two streets that connect Bon Air to Knoxville, there is no direct road or trail connection between the Bon Air mountaintop and any other neighborhoods.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of Pittsburgh neighborhoods\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Further reading ===\u000aToker, Franklin (1994) [1986].

aVPsychro Cave (Greek: \u03a3\u03c0\u03ae\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf \u03a8\u03c5\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd) is an ancient Minoan sacred cave in Lasithi plateau in the Lasithi district of eastern Crete. Psychro is associated with the Diktaean Cave (Greek: \u0394\u03b9\u03ba\u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u1f0c\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd Diktaion Antron), one of the putative sites of the birth of Zeus; other legends place it as the Idaean Cave on Mount Ida. According to Hesiod, Theogony 477, Rhea gave birth to Zeus in a cave of Mount Aegaeon, near Lyttos; since the late nineteenth century the cave above the modern village of Psychro has been identified with this sanctuary.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geography ==\u000aPsychro is 1,025 metres above sea level. The cave is located in the prefecture of Lasithi.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Myth ==\u000aThe Dictaean cave is famous in Greek mythology as the place where Amalthea, nurtured the infant Zeus with her goat's milk. The archaeology attests to the site's long use as a place of cult worship. The nurse of Zeus, who was charged by Rhea to raise the infant Zeus in secret here, to protect him from his father Cronus (Krónos) is also called the nymph Adrasteia in some contexts. It is one of a number of caves believed to have been the birthplace or hiding place of Zeus. The mountains, of which the cave are part, are known in Crete as Dikte.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Archaeology ==\u000aThe cave was first excavated in 1886 by Joseph Hatzidakis, President of the Syllogos at Candia, and F. Halbherr. In 1896, Sir Arthur Evans investigated the site.\u000aIn 1899, J. Demargne and David George Hogarth of the British School at Athens conducted further investigations; Hogarth's brief report published in 1900 gives a picture of the destruction wrought by primitive archaeological methods: immense fallen blocks from the upper cave roof were blasted before removal; the rich black earth had been previously ransacked. The stuccoed altar in the upper cave was discovered in 1900, surrounded by strata of ashes, pottery and "other refuse", among which were votive objects in bronze, terracotta, iron and bone, with fragments of some thirty libation tables and countless conical ceramic cups for food offerings. Bones among the ash layer attest to sacrifice of bulls, sheep and goats, deer and a boar.\u000aThe undisturbed lowest strata of the upper cave represented the transition between Late Minoan Kamares ware to earliest Mycenaean levels; finds represented the Geometric Style of the ninth century BCE, but few later than that. More recent excavation has revealed the use of the cave reached back to Early Minoan times, and votive objects attest to the cave's being the most frequented shrine by Middle Minoan times (MM IIIA).\u000aThe lower grotto falls steeply with traces of a rock-cut stair to a pool, out of which stalactites rise. "Much earth had been thrown down by diggers of the Upper Grotto," Hogarth reported, "and this was found full of small bronze objects." In the vertical chinks of the lowest stalactites, Hogarth's team found "toy double-axes, knife-blades, needles, and other objects in bronze, placed there by dedicators, as in niches. The mud at the edge of the subterranean pool was also rich in similar things and in statuettes of two types, male and female and engraved gems."\u000aIn 1961, the art historian and archaeologist John Boardman published the finds uncovered by these and other excavations.\u000aWhile clay human figurines are normally found in peak sanctuaries, Psychro and the sanctuary on Mount Ida stand out as the only sacred caves that have yielded human figurines. Psychro is also a unique sacred cave for a bronze leg, also known as a votive body part, which is the only votive body part to be found in a sacred cave. More common sacred cave finds at Psychro include stone and ceramic lamps.\u000aPsychro yielded an uncommon number of semi-precious stones, including carnelian, steatite, amethyst, jasper and hematite.\u000aPsychro's artefacts are now on display at the Heraklion Museum, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, the Louvre and the British Museum.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aJones, Donald W. 1999 Peak Sanctuaries and Sacred Caves in Minoan Crete ISBN 91-7081-153-9\u000aRutkowski, B. and Krzysztof Nowicki, 1996.

Within three days of his announcement, Todd had raised $50,000. In the final campaign finance filing before the election, Todd had three times the financial reserves of his nearest rival. Todd accepted donations from LLCs owned by companies, which allowed companies to donate additional money to the campaign.\u000aTodd advertised his close relationship with the mayor, saying he was the only candidate in the field who would be able to pick up the phone and discuss the ward\u2019s needs directly with her. At a debate, it was reported that Todd searched on Google when asked to name a historical figure whose leadership he admired. His campaign had no comment on the action.

After winning office and in the wake of community protests, he said was not "outright" opposed to pop-ups and wanted to balance residents' concerns with developer's interests.\u000aIn 2016, Todd announced his support for Mayor Bowser's plan to open a homeless shelter in Ward 4, hoping that it would be used as a catalyst for economic development.\u000aAfter a building was condemned in Ward 4 and its residents forced to vacate the property, Todd was described as not helpful. His office did not provide an immediate response.\u000aIn June 2016, Todd opposed campaign finance reform legislation. Introduced by Council chair Phil Mendelson, the law would have taken people who donated to political campaigns out of consideration from receiving government contracts valued at more than $100,000.\u000aIn April 2017, the DC Auditor announced that it was conducting an investigation into the financing of Todd's 2015 special election campaign. Todd was unable to substantiate donations of over $100,000 and failed to report $34,000 in donations. While the investigation was underway during the 2016 general election, it was not disclosed.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Second council term ===\u000aTodd was sworn into office for a full four-year council term at noon on January 2, 2017.\u000aOn January 20 2017, Todd attended the parade for the inauguration of Donald Trump. \u000a\u000a\u000a== Campaign finance controversy ==\u000aAfter Todd's 2015 special election win, the District government's Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) audited the Todd campaign as part of its regular after-election audit of all campaigns. The audit, completed in early January 2016, discovered that the campaign failed to report more than $34,000 in contributions. The campaign also received more than $69,000 in contributions for which it had no records indicating who made the donation. For reasons which remain unclear, the OCF agreed to keep its preliminary audit confidential until the 2015 Todd special election campaign answered the report's allegations. According to the OCF, the 2015 Todd campaign repeatedly declined to provide it with the information and answers it sought, even as Todd campaigned for a full, four-year term on the council during a hotly contest June 14, 2016, Democratic primary. Todd's 2015 campaign staff said they provided all the information the OCF asked for, but the OCF's "antiquated" technology was unable to accept or integrate the information. OCF found the campaign failed to adequately document another $100,000 in contributions.\u000aTodd won the June 14 primary with 49 percent of the vote, without voters knowing about the report's preliminary findings. His closest challenger, Leon T. Andrews, Jr., had 40.8 percent. Todd was unopposed in the general election. Once more, voters remained in the dark about the report's finding.\u000aOn April 7, 2017, about 16 months after the preliminary report was issued, The Washington Post made the report's draft findings public.\u000aThe Washington Post reported on April 17, 2017 that 136 contributors to Todd's 2016 reelection campaign could not be identified by name. The donors contributed about $18,000 to the 2016 effort. Another 1,200 of the 1,400 contributors to the campaign provided no employer information, as required by law. OCF had previously identified more than $7,000 in contributions to Todd's 2016 campaign which were illegal or questionable under D.C. campaign finance laws, and the Todd campaign returned those donations. However, About $5,000 in donations were over the legal limit of $500 per individual or business. The 2016 reelection campaign accepted these donations, and did not return them. OCF officials said they had previously identified numerous questionable donations and expenditures by the Todd 2016 reelection campaign, but many of these had been resolved and the agency was still in the process of obtaining more information.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aTodd lives in the Petworth neighborhood of Ward 4 and attends St. Mary\u2019s Episcopal Church.

aVIke Gyokuran (\u6c60\u7389\u703e, 1727\u20131784) was a Japanese Bunjinga painter, calligrapher, and poet. She was famous in Kyoto, Japan, during her lifetime, and she remains a celebrated artist in Japan. \u000aHer parents gave her the birth name Machi (\u753a). As a child, she was given the art-name Gyokuran, most likely by her painting teacher Yanagisawa Kien (1707\u20131758). Gyokuran married fellow artist Ike no Taiga, and she is best known by her married name Ike Gyokuran. Her surname before marriage was Tokuyama, and she is also known as Tokuyama Gyokuran.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life and education ==\u000aGyokuran began to learn to paint at an early age under famous literati painter Yanagisa Kien, who was a regular at her mother's teahouse. It is likely that he was the one to introduce her to Ike no Taiga, who was almost among his students.\u000aGyokuran's husband Taiga taught her the painting style of the nanga (Southern painting) movement, a Japanese version of a Chinese style. Gyokuran, in turn, taught her husband poetry in the Japanese waka style, in which she was proficient.\u000a\u000aThe couple were renowned for their eccentricity. They created art together, mutually influencing each other, and were also known to play music together for leisure, as equals. This was highly unusual in a country where women were still widely considered inferior to men. It is noted that Gyokuran did not shave her eyebrows, as was customary for married women at the time.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career and impact ==\u000a\u000aGyokuran painted folding screens and sliding doors, handheld scrolls, hanging scrolls, and fan paintings. "It was exceptionally rare for women in 18th century Japan to be painters," according to Anne d\u2019Harnoncourt, director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Gyokuran and her husband Taiga dedicated themselves to making art, living on little money, and sometimes collaborating on art pieces. She lived with Taiga in a small studio next to the Gion shrine in Kyoto. Gyokuran created folding screens, handheld scrolls, hanging scrolls, and fan paintings. She also often painted small scenes, on which she inscribed her poems in calligraphy.\u000aIn 1910, her verses were printed alongside a woodblock print of the Matsuya teahouse at the Gion Shrine in the Gion sanjo kash\u016b (Poem Collection of the Three Women of Gion).\u000aTo this day, during Kyoto's yearly Jidai Matsuri (Festival of the Ages), young women dress up as prominent female figures of Kyoto history, including Gyokuran.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Awards and honors ==\u000aSome of Gyokuran's works are designated Japanese National Treasures and Important Cultural Properties.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a"The Nanga Movement," Philadelphia Museum of Art

aVThe Landtag of Thuringia is the parliament of the German federal state of Thuringia. It convenes in Erfurt and currently consists of 91 members of five Parties. According to the free state's constitution, the primary functions of the Landtag are to pass laws, elect the Minister-President and control the government of Thuringia.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Elections ==\u000a\u000aElections are held every five years using the German Mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) system, with an election threshold of 5% vote share to receive any seats. All German citizens 18 years of age or older living in Thuringia are entitled to vote. If a party wins more constituency seats than its overall share of the vote, the overall size of the Landtag increases because of these overhang and leveling mandates.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Current Composition ==\u000a\u000aAfter the elections of 14 September 2014, the CDU is the largest party, but the left parties (Linke, SPD, Greens) hold a bare majority of seats (47 of 91) and are in coalition.\u000aControversially in December 2014, the Landtag elected first ever Left Party Minister-President, Bodo Ramelow. The Left Party is seen as the successor to the Socialist Unity Party (SED) that ruled former East Germany. Ramelow heads a left-leaning coalition consisting of his Left Party, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens, a so-called "red-red-green" coalition.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aThe Landtag of the newly established Free State of Thuringia (Freistaat Thüringen) first convened in 1920 in Weimar. Its deputies were elected for three years according to a proportional representation system, with a minimum voting age of 21. During the Weimar Republic period until 1933, six state elections were held. Upon the 1929 elections, Thuringia became one of the first German federal states where the Nazi Party gained real political power. Wilhelm Frick was appointed Minister of the Interior for the state of Thuringia after the NSDAP won six delegates to the Landtag. In the 1932 elections the Nazis emerged as the strongest party with 26 of 61 seats and Fritz Sauckel assumed the office of Minister-President. One year later, after the Nazi seizure of power in Berlin, the Landtag diet was dissolved in course of the Gleichschaltung process.\u000aAfter World War II the State of Thuringia was re-established as part of the Soviet occupation zone. On 13 June 1946 the Soviet Military Administration summoned a state assembly (Landesversammlung) chaired by Ricarda Huch; the first post-war Landtag elections were held on 20 October 1946 and the constituent meeting took place on November 21 at the Elephant hotel in Weimar. By the 1949 Constitution of East Germany, the Landtag diets were largely deprived of power and the second state elections on 15 October 1950 were already held under the terms of the National Front unity list. In 1952, the East German government dissolved the federal states and Thuringia was divided into districts (Bezirke) centered in Erfurt, Gera and Suhl.\u000aThe State of Thuringia was restored during Germany's reunification and Landtag elections were again held on 14 October 1990.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of Presidents of the Landtag of Thuringia\u000aThuringia state election, 2004\u000aThuringia state election, 2009\u000aThuringia state election, 2014\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aLandtag of Thuringia official website

aVNtombizanele Situ known as Zanele Situ (born 19 January 1971) is a Paralympian athlete from South Africa competing mainly in category F54 throwing events. Specialising in the javelin throw, Situ is a two-time gold medalist at both the Paralympics and the IPC Athletics World Championships and is the first female South African black athlete to win a Paralympic gold medal.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal history ==\u000aSitu was born in Kokstad, South Africa in 1971. At the age of twelve she experienced weakness in her legs which resulted in an inability to walk. Medical tests discovered a tuberculosis infection in her spine which resulted in a Situ entering a two-year semi-coma, from which she left with paralysis from the fourth vertebra down, leaving her wheelchair bound. After becoming disabled she was schooled at Mthatha.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Athletics career ==\u000aSitu first came to the international stage in 1998 when she represented South Africa at her first IPC Athletics World Championships, held in Birmingham, England. There she entered both the javelin and discus events, winning gold in the javelin with a best throw of 14.45 metres, and bronze in the discus throw. This led her to the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney where she won a gold in the F52-54 javelin and a silver in the F51-54 discus. By taking gold in Sydney she became the first South African female black athlete to win a Paralympic title. Two years later she successfully defended her javelin world title in Lille, but despite adding almost two meters to her discus distance from Birmingham, it was only good enough for a fourth-place finish. 2003 saw Situ recognized for her achievements by her country when she was awarded the Order of Ikhamanga (silver) for her contributions to sport.\u000aTwo years later in Athens, Situ successfully defended her javelin title at the 2004 Summer Paralympics. Although not finishing on the podium in either the shot put or the discus, she was recognized by the International Paralympic Committee as the female athlete who best embodied the spirit of the Games when she was awarded the Whang Youn Dai Achievement Award.\u000aAfter Athens, Situ entered a barren period competitively, failing to reach the podium at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing. She recovered some form in 2011, when she won bronze at Chritchurch World Championships, but the emergence of world class competitors, such as Tunisia's Hania Aidi and China's Yang Liwan, made title challenges a difficult task. At the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London Situ threw a distance of 16.22 metres, but she fell short of the podium in fourth place.\u000aIn between the 2012 and 2016 Summer Paralympics, Situ claimed two more world bronze medals, at Lyon (2013) and Doha (2015), both in the javelin. At Rio, in the 2016 Paralympics, Situ achieved a personal best in the javelin, throwing a 17.90 metre mark in her third round to take her first Paralympic medal in twelve years, a bronze. At the Rio Games she was also recognized by her country, being given the honour of flag bearer during the opening ceremony.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a Media related to Zanele Situ at Wikimedia Commons

aVDanda Nata or Danda Jatra (Odia: \u0b26\u0b23\u0b4d\u0b21 \u0b28\u0b3e\u0b1f, \u0b26\u0b23\u0b4d\u0b21 \u0b2f\u0b3e\u0b24\u0b4d\u0b30\u0b3e)is one of the most important traditional dance festivals organized in different parts of South Odisha and particularly in the Ganjam District, the heartland of ancient Kalinga Empire. The Danda Nata festival is being held in the month of Chaitra of every year. As per Ram Prasad Tripathy's article, it is an ancient festival of the Kalinga kingdom and still alive in and around the ancient Kalinga capital Sampa/Samapa i.e modern day Ganjam District. The Participants of Danda are called Danduas (also known as Bhoktas) and they pray Goddesses Kali and Shiva during this 13-, 18- or 21-day Danda period.\u000aDanda begins on an auspicious day before the Chaitra Sankranti or Meru Parba with traditional worship and fasting. The total number of days for the festival is 13, 18 or 21 days. Only male persons take part in this festival. The participants are known as the 'Bhoktas'. All the `Bhoktas` or 'Danduas' lead a very pious life for all these days during the festival and they avoid eating meat, fish or cohabiting during this period.\u000aIt is believed that the present day Danda Nata is a part of the ancient Chaitra Yatra festivals being celebrated every year at Taratarini Shakti/Tantra Peetha. The Kalinga Emperors organised this Chaitra festival for their Ista devi, Taratarini. As per folk lore, during ancient period after 20 days of Danda practice the Danduas must assemble near Taratarini Shakti/Tantra Peetha (which is ista devi of the Great Kalinga rulers) and with some hard rituals culminate their Danda on the last day.\u000aThis practice continued for many years and Chaitra Yatra which is still celebrated at Tara Tarini Shakti/Tantra Peetha in the month of Chaitra, is also another part of that old tradition. But later this Danda Nata spread to different parts of Utkala and Koshala. Now the old tradition was changed. Danda Nata groups increased abnormally and the Danduas culminating their Danda in their own villages or locality instead of Taratarini Shakti/Tantra Peetha.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Etymology ==\u000aDanda has various meanings, but there are two main meanings of the word\u000aClub, Rod, Pole, Stick, Staff, Sceptre\u000aPunishment, Chastisement\u000aThe term Nata comes from the word Natya, which gives many different denotations of music, dance and drama. The term Jatra means theatre.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Folktale of the origin of the word danda ===\u000aLord Ganesh was being taught a dance by his father, Lord Shiva. It was a religious dance called Tandava Nritya. In the process of learning the dance, Lord Shiva kicked the stage he was on, and made a sound that sounded like the word "Dan". Then a piece of brass material broke off the chain Lord Shiva wore around his ankle and fell on a percussion instrument known as Mardala. The brass material hitting the Mardala made a very loud "Da" noise. Those two sounds were put together to form the word Danda. Danda came to be associated with dance because of that episode.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Danda Nata Ceremony ==\u000aDanda Nata is an Indian dance festival that originated in the Ganjam district of Odisha. Danda Nata is a form of a religious festival that has theatrical and dance components . The dance is done mainly to worship Lord Shiva, the God of destruction of the Hindu mythology. There are other Gods and Goddesses that are worshiped by the spiritual dance also, such as Krishna Ganesh, Kali, and Durga amongst others. The low caste Hindus and the high caste, such as the Brahmins, all participated in the Danda Nata. The dance along with the accompanying events is performed over the course of three months March, April, and May. Some events are performed in March \u2013 April, the month of Chaitra, and other events are performed in April \u2013 May, the month of Vaishakha.\u000aPeople commit self- inflicted wounds to worship Lord Shiva because the philosophy of ancient Hindu says that for a person to be great, one has to have self-control over one's body (Kaya), mind (Mana), and speech (Vakya).\u000aSo in order to achieve greatness, a lot of punishments, Danda, to the individual must be undergone, so this event is known as Danda Nata.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Dance component of the religious festival ===\u000aDanda Nata consists of multiple dances. People start Danda by fasting, having a single meal a day made up of rice and dal, and worshipping their Lord before the actual dances occur. This dance consists of a series of dances which are performed one after another by the male members belonging to the Scheduled Castes and other backward castes. In this dance the Ghasis provide the music with the help of Dhol and Mahuri. The dance has a rich repertory. Parva dance is the first item of the repertory. The Prabhakar and the Prabhakariani, dressed in multi coloured dress, dance in the beginning. The dancer places a piece of cloth on his shoulders and holds the ends of the same in front with both the hands. He moves his hands forward and backward,right and left, to the rhythm of the dance. A semi-circular plate, made of bamboo sticks and covered with coloured and decorated cloth with ornamental border,is tied to the back of the Prabhkar. The Prabhakar wears multi coloured skirt and jacket. The Prabhakariani, a male in female role, dresses himself in sari and kanchala(blouse). The Prabhakariani holds apiece of coloured handkerchief in his hand. After the Parava dance is over the Hara \u2013Parvati dance begins. Then a group dance of Fakir and Fakiriani is performed. The dances of Savara and Savarani, Chadeya and Chadouni, are performed one after another. Then the party performs a leela based on a story from the Ramayana or the Mahabharata or from any other Puran through songs and dances . Patarasaura and Patarasaurani perform their dance at the end of the leela. The last, but not the least, is the Binakar who closes the performance with his most significant songs and dances. Then males that belong to backward and scheduled castes perform the Parava dance. In the Parava dance, the Prabhakar, male acting as a male, and the Prabhakariani, a male acting as a female, begin the dance in multi \u2013 colored clothing. A piece of cloth is placed on the shoulders of dancers. The cloth is held with both hands and the dancers move the cloth backwards and forwards and side to side according to the rhythm of the dance. Then immediately following that dance the Hara \u2013 Parvati is performed.\u000aAfter those dances are performed, a host of other dances are performed. The Fakir and Fakiriani, a group dance, is performed first. Then the Savara and Savarani are performed with the Chadeya and Chadouni dances being performed directly after. Then everyone gets involved in the festivities by performing a leela through songs and dances, which is based on a story from various Purans. After the leela, the Patarasaura and Patarasaurani perform their traditional dance. Lastly, the Binakar ends the events through dances and songs.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== The roles of the dancers ====\u000aThe various dances of the Danda Nata have various themes behind them. Each of the roles in the dances sing a different tune. Some songs are based on historical stories, while others have a more comical approach. Some groups use a question/answer approach. The groups that use that approach have one role, male or female role, ask questions, while the other role give answers to those replies. Although the songs can be performed through multiple approaches, all the songs have the same style, folk and Odissi.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Music ===\u000aThe music of the Danda Nata is different for different dances . The songs are of different tunes for different characters. The songs are mainly devotional and mostly based on stories from the epics. Humorous songs are sometimes sung by the dancers . sometimes they put questions in songs and their counterpart give the reply in songs. The songs are of folk and Odissi style. The dance originated from tribal dances, but has been much influenced by the Yatra and Pala performance of the state. Danda Nata is being gradually modernized in respect of music, dance, costume, style and make up. It is thereby losing its original simplicity and traditional characteristics.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Federated Moulders' (Metals) Union of Australia (FMU) was an Australian trade union which existed between 1899 and 1983. It represented moulders - skilled tradesmen who fabricated the moulds used to cast metal products in foundries.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe FMU was originally formed as the Federated Iron, Brass and Steel Moulders' Union of Australasia in 1899 through the amalgamation of several state-based unions, although it did not achieve registration under the federal arbitration system until 1916. It changed its name in 1930 to the Federated Moulders' (Metals) Union of Australia.\u000a\u000aAlthough machine moulding was first introduced into Australia in the late 19th century the FMU initially refused to admit machine and plate moulders into the union, regarding the work as relatively unskilled compared to that done by fully qualified 'jobbing' moulders. These workers were therefore organised by industrial unions, such as the Federated Stove and Piano Frame Makers Association of Australia and the Federated Agricultural Implement Machinery and Ironworkers Association of Australia. In 1920 the FMU did expand its coverage to allow machine moulders to join, although the union's staunch opposition to the piece-work system of payment under which most machine moulders worked meant that few could become members. Despite its exclusive attitude towards membership, which kept the total number of FMU members low throughout its existence, the vital position of moulders in major industries such as mining, manufacturing and the railways ensured that the union remained industrially powerful. In 1983 the FMU merged with the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union (AMWSU) to form the Amalgamated Metals, Foundry and Shipwrights' Union. \u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aHargreaves, William J.

aVForest Glade Cemetery is the oldest cemetery in Somersworth, New Hampshire. Set on 22 acres (8.9 ha) on Maple Street, it is a good example of the popular mid-19th century rural cemetery movement. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description and history ==\u000aForest Glade Cemetery is located southwest of downtown Somersworth, on the west side of Maple Street between Tates Brook Road and Bartlett Avenue. While the road frontage of the property is roughly straight, the rear line of the developed portion of the cemetery follows a broad curve. The rolling landscape has circulation roads laid out harmoniously with the terrain, which is dotted with mature plantings. The cemetery's prominent architectural features are the Furber Chapel, a stone English country chapel designed by Henry Vaughan and built in 1898, and the entrance gate, a stone arch bearing the inscription "Until the day dawns and the shadows flee away".\u000aThe cemetery was established in 1851, not long after Somersworth separated from Rollinsford, and was its first municipal cemetery. It has more than 7,000 burials, the oldest dating to 1852. In addition to more than 800 family plots, the cemetery has a dedicated section for members of the American Legion and the Grand Army of the Republic, as well as sections specifically consecrated for Jewish burials, and an area for the burial of the indigent.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aNational Register of Historic Places listings in Strafford County, New Hampshire\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVMaryland Route 255 (MD 255) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The highway runs 4.21 miles (6.78 km) from MD 2 near Owensville east to Riverside Drive in Galesville. MD 255, which was built in the 1920s, originally included the portion of MD 468 between Galesville and Shady Side; the section in Galesville was MD 393. MD 255 and MD 468 were assigned to their present courses in the late 1940s.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Route description ==\u000a\u000aMD 255 begins at an intersection with MD 2 (Solomons Island Road) near Owensville, which is also known as West River. The highway heads east as two-lane Owensville Road. The highway enters the Owensville Historic District, within which the highway intersects Owensville Sudley Road and passes historic Christ Church. MD 255 continues east to an intersection with MD 468 (Muddy Creek Road) adjacent to the Quaker Burying Ground. The highway continues east as Galesville Road into the namesake unincorporated village, where the road passes the Carrie Weedon House, the site of the Galesville Heritage Museum. MD 255 carries the name Main Street from Woodfield Road to its eastern terminus at Riverside Drive on the West River.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aMD 255 originally included Owensville Road and the portion of MD 468 from Galesville to Shadyside. The portion of MD 255 in Galesville was originally MD 393. Grading work began on MD 255 from the Annapolis\u2013Prince Frederick road east to the Quaker Burying Ground and from there south to Sudley Road in 1920. The gravel highway was completed to Sudley Road in 1921 and proposed to extend to Churchton Deale Road, which is today MD 256. The highway extended to Deep Creek Road on the south side of Shady Side in 1923. MD 255 was completed to Shady Side in 1929 and 1930, the same period during which MD 393 was constructed as a gravel road. By 1934, traffic was dense enough that MD 255 was recommended to be widened from 16 to 20 feet (4.9 to 6.1 m) from MD 2 to Shady Side. MD 468 was extended south of Galesville around the West River to Shady Side and MD 255 was extended into Galesville in 1949.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Junction list ==\u000aThe entire route is in Anne Arundel County.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a Maryland Roads portal\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aMDRoads: MD 255

aVThe Ker-Frisbie doctrine is applied in the context of extradition and generally holds that criminal defendants may be prosecuted in United States courts regardless of whether their presence has been obtained through the use of applicable extradition treaties.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aIn Ker v. Illinois, 119 U.S. 436 (1886), a messenger forcibly kidnapped the defendant from Peru and brought him back to the United States, even though he had been sent to Peru with a valid warrant and instructions to obtain the defendant with the cooperation of the local authorities. Addressing Ker's due process challenge, the Supreme Court of the United States held that "such forcible abduction is no sufficient reason why the party should not answer when brought within the jurisdiction of the court which has the right to try him for such an offence, and presents no valid objection to his trial in such court".\u000aFrisbie v. Collins, 342 U.S. 519 (1952), presented a case in which the defendant was tried in Michigan after being abducted by Michigan authorities in Chicago. Applying its decision in Ker, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction over challenges based on due process and federal kidnapping laws.\u000aMore recently, the Supreme Court relied on the Ker\u2013Frisbie doctrine in United States v. Alvarez-Machain, 504 U.S. 655 (1992). Álvarez Machaín, a Mexican citizen, was abducted and brought to the United States at the direction of the Drug Enforcement Administration. The Court rejected the argument that such abductions undermine the usefulness of extradition treaties, and it refused to read general principles of international law weighing against such abductions into the Mexican extradition treaty.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aArbour, Louise (2006).

The meadows have been managed by grazing a herd of Welsh Black cattle, but recent problems with tuberculosis have delayed this management plan.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aIn the past this was a site of ropemaking, with a windmill built in 1835 by John Carter being used to make the hemp and flax fibres employed in the trade. Around 1920, a subsequent owner of the mill, named Hayway, removed the machinery.\u000aIn 1917, the poet and novelist Mary Webb moved to Spring Cottage, a small bungalow on Lyth Hill. While living there she wrote the novel The House in Dormer Forest (1920) and delighted in the Shropshire countryside, which she was to recall in later novels and poems.\u000aAn archaeological survey of the countryside site in 2005 found former field boundaries and paths that are no longer used or seen as landscape features. One feature that was regarded as noteworthy was a disused quarry.\u000aIn September 2011 a Shropshire sky watch team, who had set up their cameras to witness the re-entry of a research satellite, instead reported a strange phenomenon\u2014a red beam of light flashing down at the ground, accompanied by a crackling electric sound. After further investigation, it was suggested that this may have been caused by a military helicopter with the ability to fire lasers at the ground.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aRopey Old Lyth Hill

aVNew Urbanism is an urban design movement which promotes environmentally friendly habits by creating walkable neighborhoods containing a wide range of housing and job types. It arose in the United States in the early 1980s, and has gradually influenced many aspects of real estate development, urban planning, and municipal land-use strategies.\u000aNew Urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design practices that were prominent until the rise of the automobile prior to World War II; it encompasses ten basic principles such as traditional neighborhood design (TND) and transit-oriented development (TOD). These ideas can all be circled back to two concepts: building a sense of community and the development of ecological practices.\u000a\u000aThe organizing body for New Urbanism is the Congress for the New Urbanism, founded in 1993. Its foundational text is the Charter of the New Urbanism, which begins:\u000a\u000aWe advocate the restructuring of public policy and development practices to support the following principles: neighborhoods should be diverse in use and population; communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car; cities and towns should be shaped by physically defined and universally accessible public spaces and community institutions; urban places should be framed by architecture and landscape design that celebrate local history, climate, ecology, and building practice.\u000a\u000aNew Urbanists support: regional planning for open space; context-appropriate architecture and planning; adequate provision of infrastructure such as sporting facilities, libraries and community centres; and the balanced development of jobs and housing. They believe their strategies can reduce traffic congestion by encouraging the population to ride bikes, walk, or take the train. They also hope that this set up will increase the supply of affordable housing and rein in suburban sprawl. The Charter of the New Urbanism also covers issues such as historic preservation, safe streets, green building, and the re-development of brownfield land. The ten Principles of Intelligent Urbanism also phrase guidelines for new urbanist approaches.\u000aArchitecturally, new urbanist developments are often accompanied by New Classical, postmodern, or vernacular styles, although that is not always the case.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Background ==\u000a\u000aUntil the mid 20th century, cities were generally organized into and developed around mixed-use walkable neighborhoods. For most of human history this meant a city that was entirely walkable, although with the development of mass transit the reach of the city extended outward along transit lines, allowing for the growth of new pedestrian communities such as streetcar suburbs. But with the advent of cheap automobiles and favorable government policies, attention began to shift away from cities and towards ways of growth more focused on the needs of the car. Specifically, after World War II urban planning largely centered around the use of municipal zoning ordinances to segregate residential from commercial and industrial development, and focused on the construction of low-density single-family detached houses as the preferred housing format for the growing middle class. The physical separation of where people live from where they work, shop and frequently spend their recreational time, together with low housing density, which often drastically reduced population density relative to historical norms, made automobiles indispensable for practical transportation and contributed to the emergence of a culture of automobile dependency.\u000a\u000aThis new system of development, with its rigorous separation of uses, arose after World War II and became known as "conventional suburban development" or pejoratively as urban sprawl. The majority of U.S. citizens now live in suburban communities built in the last fifty years, and automobile use per capita has soared.\u000a\u000aAlthough New Urbanism as an organized movement would only arise later, a number of activists and thinkers soon began to criticize the modernist planning techniques being put into practice. Social philosopher and historian Lewis Mumford criticized the "anti-urban" development of post-war America. The Death and Life of Great American Cities, written by Jane Jacobs in the early 1960s, called for planners to reconsider the single-use housing projects, large car-dependent thoroughfares, and segregated commercial centers that had become the "norm." The French architect François Spoerry has developed in the 60's the concept of "soft architecture" that he applied to Port Grimaud, a new marina in south of France. The success of this project had a considerable influence and led to many new projects of soft architecture like Port Liberté in New Jersey or Le Plessis Robisson in France.\u000aRooted in these early dissenters, the ideas behind New Urbanism began to solidify in the 1970s and 80s with the urban visions and theoretical models for the reconstruction of the "European" city proposed by architect Leon Krier, and the pattern language theories of Christopher Alexander. The term "new urbanism" itself started being used in this context in the mid-1980s, but it wasn't until the early 1990s that it was commonly written as a proper noun capitalized.\u000aIn 1991, the Local Government Commission, a private nonprofit group in Sacramento, California, invited architects Peter Calthorpe, Michael Corbett, Andrés Duany, Elizabeth Moule, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, Stefanos Polyzoides, and Daniel Solomon to develop a set of community principles for land use planning. Named the Ahwahnee Principles (after Yosemite National Park's Ahwahnee Hotel), the commission presented the principles to about one hundred government officials in the fall of 1991, at its first Yosemite Conference for Local Elected Officials.\u000aCalthorpe, Duany, Moule, Plater-Zyberk, Polyzoides, and Solomon founded the Chicago-based Congress for the New Urbanism in 1993. The CNU has grown to more than three thousand members, and is the leading international organization promoting New Urbanist design principles. It holds annual Congresses in various U.S. cities.\u000aIn 2009, co-founders Elizabeth Moule, Hank Dittmar, and Stefanos Polyzoides authored the Canons of Sustainable Architecture and Urbanism to clarify and detail the relationship between New Urbanism and sustainability. The Canons are "a set of operating principles for human settlement that reestablish the relationship between the art of building, the making of community, and the conservation of our natural world." They promote the use of passive heating and cooling solutions, the use of locally obtained materials, and in general, a "culture of permanence." \u000aNew Urbanism is a broad movement that spans a number of different disciplines and geographic scales. And while the conventional approach to growth remains dominant, New Urbanist principles have become increasingly influential in the fields of planning, architecture, and public policy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Defining elements ==\u000a\u000aAndrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, two of the founders of the Congress for the New Urbanism, observed mixed-use streetscapes with corner shops, front porches, and a diversity of well-crafted housing while living in one of the Victorian neighborhoods of New Haven, Connecticut. They and their colleagues observed patterns including the following:\u000a\u000aThe neighborhood has a discernible center. This is often a square or a green and sometimes a busy or memorable street corner. A transit stop would be located at this center.\u000aMost of the dwellings are within a five-minute walk of the center, an average of roughly 0.25 miles (0.40 km).\u000aThere are a variety of dwelling types \u2014 usually houses, rowhouses, and apartments \u2014 so that younger and older people, singles and families, the poor and the wealthy may find places to live.\u000aAt the edge of the neighborhood, there are shops and offices of sufficiently varied types to supply the weekly needs of a household.\u000aA small ancillary building or garage apartment is permitted within the backyard of each house. It may be used as a rental unit or place to work (for example, an office or craft workshop).\u000aAn elementary school is close enough so that most children can walk from their home.\u000aThere are small playgrounds accessible to every dwelling \u2014 not more than a tenth of a mile away.\u000aStreets within the neighborhood form a connected network, which disperses traffic by providing a variety of pedestrian and vehicular routes to any destination.\u000aThe streets are relatively narrow and shaded by rows of trees. This slows traffic, creating an environment suitable for pedestrians and bicycles.\u000aBuildings in the neighborhood center are placed close to the street, creating a well-defined outdoor room.\u000aParking lots and garage doors rarely front the street. Parking is relegated to the rear of buildings, usually accessed by alleys.\u000aCertain prominent sites at the termination of street vistas or in the neighborhood center are reserved for civic buildings. These provide sites for community meetings, education, and religious or cultural activities.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Terminology ==\u000a\u000aSeveral terms are viewed either as synonymous, included in, or overlapping with the New Urbanism. The terms Neotraditional Development or Traditional Neighborhood Development are often associated with the New Urbanism. These terms generally refer to complete New Towns or new neighborhoods, often built in traditional architectural styles, as opposed to smaller infill and redevelopment projects. The term Traditional Urbanism has also been used to describe the New Urbanism by those who object to the "new" moniker. The term "Walkable Urbanism" was proposed as an alternative term by developer and professor Christopher Leinberger. Many debate whether Smart Growth and the New Urbanism are the same or whether substantive differences exist between the two; overlap exists in membership and content between the two movements. Placemaking is another term that is often used to signify New Urbanist efforts or those of like-minded groups. The term Transit-Oriented Development is sometimes cited as being coined by prominent New Urbanist Peter Calthorpe and is heavily promoted by New Urbanists. The term Sustainable development is sometimes associated with the New Urbanism as there has been an increasing focus on the environmental benefits of New Urbanism associated with the rise of the term sustainability in the 2000s, however, this has caused some confusion as the term is also used by the United Nations and Agenda 21 to include human development issues (e.g., developing country) that exceed the scope of land development intended to be addressed by the New Urbanism or Sustainable Urbanism. The term "livability" or "livable communities" was popular under the Obama administration, though it dates back at least to the mid-1990s when the term was used by the Local Government Commission.\u000a\u000aPlanning magazine discussed the proliferation of "urbanisms" in an article in 2011 titled "A Short Guide to 60 of the Newest Urbanisms."  Several New Urbanists have popularized terminology under the umbrella of the New Urbanism including Sustainable Urbanism and Tactical Urbanism (of which Guerrilla Urbanism can be viewed as a subset). The term Tactical Urbanism was coined by Frenchman Michel de Certau in 1968 and revived in 2011 by New Urbanist Mike Lydon and the co-authors of the Tactical Urbanism Guide. In 2011 Andres Duany authored a book that used the term Agrarian Urbanism to describe an agriculturally-focused subset of New Urbanist town design. In 2013 a group of New Urbanists led by CNU co-founder Andres Duany began a research project under the banner of Lean Urbanism which purported to provide a bridge between Tactical Urbanism and the New Urbanism.\u000aOther terms have surfaced in reaction to the New Urbanism intended to provide a contrast, alternative to, or a refinement of the New Urbanism. Some of these terms include Everyday Urbanism by Harvard Professor Margaret Crawford, John Chase, and John Kaliski, Ecological Urbanism, and True Urbanism by architect Bernard Zyscovich. Landscape urbanism was popularized by Charles Waldheim who explicitly defined it as in opposition to the New Urbanism in his lectures at Harvard University. Landscape Urbanism and its Discontents, edited by Andres Duany and Emily Talen, specifically addressed the tension between these two views of urbanism. Michael E. Arth promotes what he describes as a variant of the New Urbanism called the New Pedestrianism, which is intended to be more pedestrian-oriented and traces its origins to a 1929 planned community in Radburn, New Jersey.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Organizations ==\u000a\u000aThe primary organization promoting the New Urbanism in the United States is the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU). The Congress for the New Urbanism is the leading organization promoting walkable, mixed-use neighborhood development, sustainable communities and healthier living conditions. CNU members promote the principles of CNU's Charter and the hallmarks of New Urbanism, including:\u000aLivable streets arranged in compact, walkable blocks.\u000aA range of housing choices to serve people of diverse ages and income levels.\u000aSchools, stores and other nearby destinations reachable by walking, bicycling or transit service.\u000aAn affirming, human-scaled public realm where appropriately designed buildings define and enliven streets and other public spaces.\u000aThe CNU has met annually since 1993 when they held their first general meeting in Alexandria, Virginia, with approximately one hundred attendees. By 2008 the Congress was drawing two to three thousand attendees to the annual meetings.\u000aThe CNU began forming local and regional chapters circa 2004 with the founding of the New England and Florida Chapters. By 2011 there were 16 official chapters and interest groups for 7 more. As of 2013, Canada hosts two full CNU Chapters, one in Ontario (CNU Ontario), and one in British Columbia (Cascadia) which also includes a portion of the north-west US states.\u000aWhile the CNU has international participation in Canada, sister organizations have been formed in other areas of the world including the Council for European Urbanism (CEU), the Movement for Israeli Urbanism (MIU) and the Australian Council for the New Urbanism.\u000aBy 2002 chapters of Students for the New Urbanism began appearing at universities including the Savannah College of Art and Design, University of Georgia, University of Notre Dame, and the University of Miami. In 2003, a group of younger professionals and students met at the 11th Congress in Washington, D.C. and began developing a "Manifesto of the Next Generation of New Urbanists". The Next Generation of New Urbanists held their first major session the following year at the 12th meeting of the CNU in Chicago in 2004. The group has continued meeting annually as of 2014 with a focus on young professionals, students, new member issues, and ensuring the flow of fresh ideas and diverse viewpoints within the New Urbanism and the CNU. Spinoff projects of the Next Generation of the New Urbanists include the Living Urbanism publication first published in 2008 and the first Tactical Urbanism Guide.\u000aThe CNU has spawned publications and research groups. Publications include the New Urban News and the New Town Paper. Research groups have formed independent nonprofits to research individual topics such as the Form-Based Codes Institute, The National Charrette Institute and the Center for Applied Transect Studies.\u000aIn the United Kingdom New Urbanist and European urbanism principles are practised and taught by The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment. Other organisations promote New Urbanism as part of their remit, such as INTBAU, A Vision of Europe, and others.\u000aThe CNU and other national organizations have also formed partnerships with like-minded groups. Organizations under the banner of Smart Growth also often work with the Congress for the New Urbanism. In addition the CNU has formed partnerships on specific projects such as working with the United States Green Building Council and the Natural Resources Defense Council to develop the LEED for Neighborhood Development standards, and with the Institute of Transportation Engineers to develop a Context Sensitive Solutions (CSS) Design manual.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Film ==\u000aThe New Urbanism Film Festival was held in 2013 and 2014 in Los Angeles to highlight films and short films about the New Urbanism and related topics. The 2011 film Urbanized by Gary Hustwit featured then CNU Board Chair Ellen Dunham-Jones and other urban thinkers on the international story of urbanization including the New Urbanist efforts in the United States.\u000aThe 2004 documentary The End of Suburbia: Oil Depletion and the Collapse of the American Dream argues that the depletion of oil will result in the demise of the sprawl-type development. New Urban Cowboy: Toward a New Pedestrianism, a feature length 2008 documentary about urban designer Michael E. Arth, explains the principles of his New Pedestrianism, a more ecological and pedestrian-oriented version of New Urbanism. The film also gives a brief history of New Urbanism, and chronicles the rebuilding of an inner city slum into a model of New Pedestrianism and New Urbanism called The Garden District.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Criticism ==\u000aNew Urbanism has drawn both praise and criticism from all parts of the political spectrum. It has been criticized both for being a social engineering scheme and for failing to address social equity and for both restricting private enterprise and for being a deregulatory force in support of private sector developers.\u000aJournalist Alex Marshall has decried New Urbanism as essentially a marketing scheme that repackages conventional suburban sprawl behind a façade of nostalgic imagery and empty, aspirational slogans. In a 1996 article in Metropolis Magazine, Marshall denounced New Urbanism as "a grand fraud". The attack continued in numerous articles, including an opinion column in the Washington Post in September of the same year, and in Marshall's first book, How Cities Work: Suburbs, Sprawl, and the Roads Not Taken\u000aCritics have asserted that the effectiveness claimed for the New Urbanist solution of mixed income developments lacks statistical evidence. Independent studies have supported the idea of addressing poverty through mixed-income developments, but the argument that New Urbanism produces such diversity has been challenged from findings from one community in Canada.\u000aSome parties have criticized the New Urbanism for being too accommodating of motor vehicles and not going far enough to promote walking, cycling, and public transport. The Charter of the New Urbanism states that "communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car". Some critics suggest that communities should exclude the car altogether in favor of car-free developments. Michael E Arth proposes new pedestrianism as a way to further elevate the status of pedestrians by focusing on pedestrian-only paths. Steve Melia proposes the idea of "filtered permeability" (see Permeability (spatial and transport planning)) which increases the connectivity of the pedestrian and cycling network resulting in a time and convenience advantage over drivers while still limiting the connectivity of the vehicular network and thus maintaining the safety benefits of cul de sacs and horseshoe loops in resistance to property crime.\u000aIn response to critiques of a lack of evidence for the New Urbanism's claimed environmental benefits, a rating system for neighborhood environmental design, LEED-ND, was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Congress for the New Urbanism, to quantify the sustainability of New Urbanist neighborhood design. New Urbanist and board member of CNU, Doug Farr has taken a step further and coined Sustainable Urbanism, which combines New Urbanism and LEED-ND to create walkable, transit-served urbanism with high performance buildings and infrastructure.\u000aNew Urbanism has been criticized for being a form of centrally planned, large-scale development, "instead of allowing the initiative for construction to be taken by the final users themselves". It has been criticized for asserting universal principles of design instead of attending to local conditions.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Examples ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== United States ===\u000aNew Urbanism is having a growing influence on how and where metropolitan regions choose to grow. At least fourteen large-scale planning initiatives are based on the principles of linking transportation and land-use policies, and using the neighborhood as the fundamental building block of a region. Miami, Florida, has adopted the most ambitious New Urbanist-based zoning code reform yet undertaken by a major U.S. city.\u000aMore than six hundred new towns, villages, and neighborhoods, following New Urbanist principles, have been planned or are currently under construction in the U.S. Hundreds of new, small-scale, urban and suburban infill projects are under way to reestablish walkable streets and blocks. In Maryland and several other states, New Urbanist principles are an integral part of smart growth legislation.\u000aIn the mid-1990s, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) adopted the principles of the New Urbanism in its multibillion-dollar program to rebuild public housing projects nationwide. New Urbanists have planned and developed hundreds of projects in infill locations. Most were driven by the private sector, but many, including HUD projects, used public money.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== University Place in Memphis ====\u000aIn 2010 University Place in Memphis became the second only U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED certified neighborhood. LEED ND (neighborhood development) standards integrates principles of smart growth, urbanism and green building and were developed through a collaboration between USGBC, Congress for the New Urbanism, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. University Place, developed by McCormack Baron Salazar, is a 405-unit, 30-acre, mixed-income, mixed use, multigenerational, HOPE VI grant community that revitalized the severely distressed Lamar Terrace public housing site.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== The Cotton District ====\u000aThe Cotton District in Starkville, Mississippi, was the first New Urbanist development, begun in 1968 long before the New Urbanism movement was organized. The District borders Mississippi State University, and consists mostly of residential rental units for college students along with restaurants, bars and retail. The Cotton District got its name because it is built in the vicinity of an old cotton mill.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Seaside ====\u000aSeaside, Florida, the first fully New Urbanist town, began development in 1981 on eighty acres (324,000 m²) of Florida Panhandle coastline. It was featured on the cover of the Atlantic Monthly in 1988, when only a few streets were completed, and has become internationally famous for its architecture, and the quality of its streets and public spaces.\u000aSeaside is now a tourist destination and appeared in the 1998 movie The Truman Show. Lots sold for $15,000 in the early 1980s, and slightly over a decade later, the price had escalated to about $200,000. Today, most lots sell for more than a million dollars, and some houses top $5 million.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Mueller Community ====\u000aThe Mueller Community is located on the 700 acre site of the former Robert Mueller Municipal Airport in Austin, Texas, which closed in 1999. Per the developer, the value of the Mueller development upon completion will be $1.3 billion, and will comprise 4.2 million square feet of non-residential development, 650,000 square feet of retail space, 4,600 homes, and 140 acres of open space. An estimated 10,000 permanent jobs within the development will have been created by the time it is complete. The Mueller Community also has more electric cars per capita than any other neighborhood in the United States \u2013 a fact partially attributable to an incentive program.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Stapleton ====\u000aThe site of the former Stapleton International Airport in Denver and Aurora, Colorado, closed in 1995, is now being redeveloped by Forest City Enterprises. Stapleton is expected to be home to at least 30,000 residents, six schools and 2 million square feet (180,000 m²) of retail. Construction began in 2001. Northfield Stapleton, one of the development's major retail centers, recently opened.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== San Antonio ====\u000aIn 1997 San Antonio, Texas, as part of a new master plan, created new regulations called the Unified Development Code (UDC), largely influenced by New Urbanism. One feature of the UDC is six unique land development patterns that can be applied to certain districts: Conservation Development, Commercial Center Development, Office or Institutional Campus Development, Commercial Retrofit Development, Tradition Neighborhood Development, Transit Oriented Development. Each district has specific standards and design regulation. The six development patterns were created to reflect existing development patterns.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Mountain House ====\u000aMountain House, one of the latest New Urbanist projects in the United States, is a new town located near Tracy, California. Construction started in 2001. Mountain House will consist of 12 villages, each with its own elementary school, park, and commercial area. In addition, a future train station, transit center and bus system are planned for Mountain House.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Mesa del Sol ====\u000aMesa del Sol, New Mexico\u2014the largest New Urbanist project in the United States\u2014was designed by architect Peter Calthorpe, and is being developed by Forest City Enterprises. Mesa del Sol may take five decades to reach full build-out, at which time it should have 38,000 residential units, housing a population of 100,000; a 1,400-acre (5.7 km2) industrial office park; four town centers; an urban center; and a downtown that would provide a twin city within Albuquerque.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== I'On ====\u000aLocated in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, I'On is a traditional neighborhood development, mixed with a new urbanism styled architecture, reflecting on the building designs of the nearby downtown areas of Charleston, South Carolina. Founded on April 30, 1995, I'On was designed by the town planning firms of Dover, Kohl & Partners and Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company, and currently holds over 750 single family homes. Features of the community include extensive sidewalks, shared public greens and parks, trails and a grid of narrow, traffic calming streets. Most homes are required to have a front porch of not less than eight feet (2.46 m) in depth. Floor heights of 10 feet (3.1 m), raised foundations and smaller lot sizes give the community a dense, vertical feel.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Haile Plantation ====\u000aHaile Plantation, Florida, is a 2,600 household (1,700 acres (6.9 km2)) development of regional impact southwest of the city of Gainesville, within Alachua County. Haile Village Center is a traditional neighborhood center within the development. It was originally started in 1978 and completed in 2007. In addition to the 2,600 homes the neighborhood consists of two merchant centers (one a New England narrow street village and the other a chain grocery strip mall). There are also two public elementary schools and an 18-hole golf course.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Celebration, Florida ====\u000aIn June 1996, the Walt Disney Company unveiled its 5,000 acre (20 km²) town of Celebration, near Orlando, Florida. Celebration opened its downtown in October 1996, relying heavily on the experiences of Seaside, whose downtown was nearly complete. Disney shuns the label New Urbanism, calling Celebration simply a "town."\u000aCelebration's Downtown has become one of the area's most popular tourist destinations making the community a showcase for New Urbanism as a prime example of the creation of a "sense of place".\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Jersey City ====\u000aThe construction of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail in Hudson County, New Jersey has spurred transit-oriented development. In Jersey City, two projects are planned to transform brownfield sites, both of which have required remediation of toxic waste by previous owners. Bayfront, once site of a Honeywell plant is a 100 acres (0.40 km2) site on the Hackensack River, and is nearby the planned West Campus of New Jersey City University. Canal Crossing, named for the former Morris Canal, was once partially owned by PPG Industries, and is a 117 acres (0.47 km2) site west of Liberty State Park.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Old York Village, Chesterfield Township, New Jersey ====\u000aThe sparsely developed agricultural Township of Chesterfield in New Jersey covers approximately 21.61 square miles (56.0 km2) and has made farmland preservation a priority since the 1970s. Chesterfield has permanently preserved more than 7,000 acres (28 km2) of farmland through state and county programs and a township-wide transfer of development credits program that directs future growth to a designated "receiving area" known as Old York Village. Old York Village is a neo-traditional, new urbanism town on 560 acres (2.3 km2) incorporating a variety of housing types, neighborhood commercial facilities, a new elementary school, civic uses, and active and passive open space areas with preserved agricultural land surrounding the planned village. Construction began in the early 2000s and a significant percentage of the community is now complete. Old York Village was the winner of the American Planning Association National Outstanding Planning Award in 2004.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Civita ====\u000aCivita is a sustainable, transit-oriented 230-acre master-planned village under development in the Mission Valley area of San Diego, California, United States. Located on a former quarry site, the urban-style village is organized around a 19-acre community park that cascades down the terraced property. Civita development plans call for 60 to 70 acres of parks and open space, 4,780 residences (including approximately 478 affordable units), an approximately 480,000-square-foot retail center, and 420,000 square feet for an office/business campus.\u000aSudberry Properties, the developer of Civita, incorporated numerous green building practices in the Civita design. In 2009, Civita achieved a Stage 1 Gold rating for the U.S. Green Building Council\u2019s 2009 LEED-ND (Neighborhood Development) pilot and received the California Governor\u2019s Environmental and Economic Leadership Award. In 2010, Civita was designated as a California Catalyst Community by the California Department of Housing and Community Development to support innovation and test sustainable strategies that reflect the interdependence of environmental, economic, and community health.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Del Mar Station ====\u000aDel Mar (Los Angeles Metro station), which won a Congress for the New Urbanism Charter Award in 2003, is a transit-oriented development surrounding a prominent Metro Rail stop on the Gold Line, which connects Los Angeles and Pasadena. Located at the southern edge of downtown Pasadena, it serves as a gateway to the city with 347 apartments, out of which 15% are affordable units. Approximately 20,000 square feet of retail is linked with a network of public plazas, paseos and private courtyards. The 3.4-acre, $77 million project sits above a 1,200-car multi-level subterranean parking garage, with 600 spaces dedicated to transit. The light rail right of way, detailed as a public street, bisects the site. It was designed by Moule & Polyzoides.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Norfolk VA East Beach ====\u000aNorfolk, VA, East Beach. designed and built in the style of traditional Atlantic coastal villages. The Master Plan for East Beach was developed in the style of \u201cNew Urbanism\u201d by world renowned TND master planners Duany Plater-Zyberk. Newly constructed homes reflect traditional classic detail and proportion of Tidewater Virginia homes, and are built with materials that will withstand the test of time and forces of Mother Nature and the Chesapeake Bay.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Other countries ===\u000aNew Urbanism is closely related to the Urban village movement in Europe. They both occurred at similar times and share many of the same principles although urban villages has an emphasis on traditional city planning. In Europe many brown-field sites have been redeveloped since the 1980s following the models of the traditional city neighbourhoods rather than Modernist models. One well-publicized example is Poundbury in England, a suburban extension to the town of Dorchester, which was built on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall under the overview of Prince Charles. The original masterplan was designed by Leon Krier. A report carried out after the first phase of construction found a high degree of satisfaction by residents, although the aspirations to reduce car dependency had not been successful. Rising house prices and a perceived premium have made the open market housing unaffordable for many local people.\u000aThe Council for European Urbanism (CEU), formed in 2003, shares many of the same aims as the U.S.'s New Urbanists. CEU's Charter is a development of the Congress for the New Urbanism Charter revised and reorganised to relate better to European conditions. An Australian organisation, Australian Council for New Urbanism has since 2001 run conferences and events to promote New Urbanism in that country. A New Zealand Urban Design Protocol was created by the Ministry for the Environment in 2005.\u000aThere are many developments around the world that follow New Urbanist principles to a greater or lesser extent:\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Europe ====\u000aLe Plessis-Robinson, a 21st-century example of neo-traditionalism, in the south-west of Paris. This city is in the process of transforming itself, destroying old modern blocklike buildings and replacing them with traditional buildings and houses in one of the biggest worldwide projects with Val d'Europe. In 2008 the city was nominated best architectural project of the European Union.\u000aPoundbury, in Dorset, England, is a neotraditionalist urban extension focussed on high quality urban realm and the expression of traditional modes of urban or village life.\u000aTornagrain, Between Inverness and Nairn, Scotland, The design is based on the architectural and planning traditions of the Highlands and the rest of Scotland.\u000aVal d'Europe, east of Paris, France. Developed by Disneyland Resort Paris, this town is a kind of European counterpart to Walt Disney World Celebration City.\u000aJakriborg, in Southern Sweden, is a recent example of the New Urbanist movement.\u000aBrandevoort, in Helmond, in the Netherlands, is a new example of the New Urbanist movement.\u000aSankt Eriksområdet quarter in Stockholm, Sweden, built in the 1990s.\u000aOther developments can be found at Heulebrug, part of Knokke-Heist, in Belgium, and Fonti di Matilde in San Bartolomeo (outside of Reggio Emilia), Italy.\u000aKartanonkoski, in Vantaa, Finland, is the only example of neotraditional architecture in Finland implemented on a larger scale. The area has around 4000 inhabitants and it's architecture has been mainly influenced by Nordic Classicism.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Americas ====\u000aMahogany Bay Village, Belize, is a 60-acre New Urbanist community on Ambergris Caye, Belize.\u000aOrchid Bay, Belize, is one of the largest New Urbanist projects in Central America and the Caribbean.\u000aLas Catalinas, Costa Rica, is a coastal town in the Guanacaste Province of Northwest Costa Rica. Envisioned as a compact, walkable beach town, Las Catalinas was founded in 2006 by Charles Brewer and incorporates many of the principles of New Urbanism.\u000aMcKenzie Towne is a New Urbanist development which commenced in 1995 by Carma Developers LP in Calgary.\u000aCornell, within the city of Markham, Ontario, was designed with walkable neighborhoods, density to support public transit, a variety of housing types and retail.\u000aNew Amherst is a new urbanist development in the town of Cobourg, Ontario.\u000aUniverCity, beside the Simon Fraser University campus on Burnaby Mountain in Burnaby, British Columbia, is an award-winning sustainable community that is designed to be walkable, dense, and well connected to public transit networks.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Asia ====\u000aThe structure plan for Thimphu, Bhutan, follows Principles of Intelligent Urbanism, which share underlying axioms with the New Urbanism.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Africa ====\u000aThere are several such developments in South Africa. The most notable is Melrose Arch in Johannesburg. Triple Point is a comparable mixed-use development in East London, in Eastern Cape province. The development, announced in 2007, comprises 30 hectares. It is made up of three apartment complexes together with over 30 residential sites as well as 20,000 sq m of residential and office space. The development is valued at over R2 billion ($250 million).\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Australia ====\u000aMost new developments on the edges of Australia's major cities are master planned, often guided expressly by the principles of New Urbanism. The relationship between housing, activity centres, the transport network and key social infrastructure (sporting facilities, libraries, community centres etc.) is defined at structure planning stage.\u000aTullimbar Village, NSW Australia, is a new development which follows the principles of New Urbanism.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aCongress for the New Urbanism\u000aAustralian Council for New Urbanism\u000aCouncil for European Urbanism\u000aNewUrbanism.org\u000aTransit Oriented Development Institute\u000aThe Next Generation of New Urbanists\u000aA Vision of Europe\u000aSustainable Urban Development Resource Guide\u000aPolis: Building Really Compact

aVThe Carpet People is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett. It was originally published in 1971, but was later re-written by the author when his work became more widespread and well-known. In the Author's Note of the revised edition, published in 1992, Pratchett wrote: "This book had two authors, and they were both the same person."\u000aThe Carpet People contains much of the humour and some of the concepts which later became a major part of the Discworld series, as well as parodies of everyday objects from our world. Before creating the Discworld, Pratchett wrote about two different flat worlds, first in this novel, and then in the novel Strata.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot summary ==\u000aThe story follows the journey of a tribe called the Munrungs, across a world known as the Carpet. Its resemblance to carpets does not end there; instead of trees, the landscape is a forest of hairs, and is littered with large grains of dust or grit. The sky is only referred to as above and below the surface is underlay, riddled with caves and inhabited by silverfish, and ultimately the Floor.\u000aThe Munrungs cross the carpet to find a new home after their village is destroyed by the powerful and mysterious natural force Fray. The origins of Fray are never explained in the book, but it is described in a way to suggest sweeping or vacuuming (some reviewers have suggested it represents human footfalls), and is referred to as sweeping on the back cover of the current UK edition.\u000aThe tribe is led by Glurk, who is advised by Pismire, a philosopher and the tribal Shaman. Glurk's younger brother Snibril, however, is the book's protagonist, and is described by Pismire as having the kind of enquiring mind which is "dangerous". Snibril also has the unique ability to detect Fray a few minutes before it strikes - this ability manifests itself as an extremely painful migraine.\u000aThe only metal on the carpet is mined from a dropped penny; wood is taken from discarded matchsticks, while the clairvoyant Wights obtain varnish by scraping it from a chair leg (the chair leg is known to the Carpet People as "Achairleg").\u000aThe story ends following an epic battle against the Mouls - a race of Fray-worshipping creatures. At this point Snibril makes the decision to leave the tribe and to explore the furthest reaches of the carpet.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Themes ==\u000aThe book explores the conflict between traditions and innovation. There is an established civilization, complete with bureaucrats, taxes imposed and collected, and permits; there are people who resent the establishment; there is a need for both groups to find common ground in order to save their collective civilization.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Continuity ==\u000aTerry Pratchett's novel Eric mentions that the president of the cabinet of demons has carpets inhabited by tribes of liliputs, possibly suggesting a link between The Carpet People and Discworld universes, or possibly merely one of Pratchett's in-jokes.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aThe Carpet People at The L-Space Web

aVThe PBA Developmental League, or PBA D-League, is the Philippine Basketball Association's official minor league basketball organization.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe PBA D-League was conceptualized after the failure of the proposed merger between the Philippine Basketball League (PBL) and Liga Pilipinas following the staging of the Tournament of the Philippines which was composed by PBL and Liga Pilipinas teams. PBA Commissioner Chito Salud proposed the formation of a PBA D-League, which will fill the void left by the PBL. On January 25, 2011, the PBA Board of Governors approved the proposal.\u000aThe maiden tournament, named "Foundation Cup" began on March 12, 2011 at the Filoil Flying V Arena in San Juan. The tournament composed of 13 teams, with five teams (Junior Powerade, NLEX, Maynilad, Freego and Cafe France) having affiliation with existing PBA teams. Four teams (Cobra Energy Drink, Agri-Nature Inc./FCA, Pharex, and Cafe France) from the Philippine Basketball League filed for application in the PBA D-League, when they failed to acquire a sixth team in order to smoothly run the league. The NLEX Road Warriors became the champions of the tournament, winning two games to none against the Cebuana Lhuillier Gems.\u000aThe second tournament, dubbed as the "Aspirant's Cup" began on October 20. Four teams (Maynilad, Junior Powerade, Max Bond and Pharex) did not join the tournament. However, two new teams (Boracay Rhum and Informatics Icons) made their debut in the D-League.\u000aThe D-League has held its own rookie draft since the 2013\u201314 PBA season.\u000aIn August 2015, the PBA approved plans for a nationwide D-League and a Women's D-League that will open soon. From 2016, the men's competition will first be held in three separate, simultaneous tournaments, first in Luzon and later in the Visayas and Mindanao. The three regional champions could join the national championship round which will be joined by Metro Manila teams.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Teams ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Current teams ===\u000aThe following are the participating teams of the 2018 PBA D-League Aspirants Cup:\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Former teams ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== List of champions ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aPhilippine Basketball Association\u000aPBA Rush\u000aBasketball in the Philippines\u000aList of developmental and minor sports leagues\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial Website

aVBerneice Edna Hansell (1897\u20131981), known as Bernice Hansen, provided the voice for female and young characters in the mid to late 1930s for various cartoon studios, most notably Warner Bros., where she played Little Kitty in I Haven't Got a Hat (1935).\u000aBecause of a lack of on-screen voice credits on cartoons throughout the 1930s, identifying many actors has been a challenge to historians, resulting in incorrect guesses, especially with many female voices portraying young animals that sound very similar. She has, for example, been incorrectly identified as providing the voice of Sniffles.\u000aHansell was born in Los Angeles, California on July 11, 1897 to Edward and T. Belle (Carey) Hansell. Her father was an Englishman who arrived in the United States in 1877. Her mother was from Iowa. Edward Hansell worked as a jeweller and then an optician during the 1920s, and as an elevator operator during the Depression of the 1930s. Hansell found work as a stenographer and then as a dressmaker on the Warner Bros. lot She managed to find work in cartoons at the Walt Disney Studio and provided squeaks for Mickey Mouse. That same year, she found work in the Leon Schlesinger and Walter Lantz studios.\u000aHer animation career petered out in the early 1940s. She died in Los Angeles on April 16, 1981, age 83.

aVThe discography of N.W.A, an American hip hop group, consists of two studio albums, six compilation albums, one extended play (EP), eight singles, one video album and five music videos. N.W.A was formed in Compton, California in 1986 by Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Arabian Prince and Ice Cube, with The D.O.C. and MC Ren joining later. The group's first release was the compilation album N.W.A. and the Posse in 1987, which also featured songs by The Fila Fresh Crew, Rappinstine and Ron-De-Vu. Their debut album Straight Outta Compton followed the next year, which initially reached number 37 on the US Billboard 200; it has since reached number four, and has sold over 3.5 million copies in the US alone. "Straight Outta Compton", "Gangsta Gangsta" and "Express Yourself" were released as singles from the album, all of which registered on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\u000aIce Cube left N.W.A in 1989 due to ongoing financial disagreements. The remaining members released the EP 100 Miles and Runnin' in 1990, which reached the top ten of the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and has since been certified platinum by the RIAA. N.W.A's second and final album followed in 1991: Niggaz4Life, commonly referred to backwards as Efil4Zaggin, immediately topped the Billboard 200 chart and sold over 2 million copies in the US. The album's singles were "Appetite for Destruction" and "Alwayz into Somethin'", neither of which charted in the US. Niggaz4Life: The Only Home Video was released in 1992, featuring three music videos and previously unreleased footage. Dr. Dre left N.W.A the same year, at which point the group had essentially disbanded. Since the group's breakup a number of compilation albums have been released, including 1996's Greatest Hits which reached the top 50 of the Billboard 200.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Albums ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Studio albums ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Compilation albums ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Extended plays ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Singles ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other charted songs ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Videos ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Video albums ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Music videos ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of songs recorded by N.W.A\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aN.W.A at AllMusic\u000aN.W.A discography at Discogs\u000aN.W.A discography at MusicBrainz

aVPaddington Green Police Station was located in Paddington, central London, England. The station was operated by the Metropolitan Police Service, and was a conventional police station, open to members of the public from 08:00 - 18:00, from Monday to Sunday. Prior to it's closure it also served as the most important high-security station in the United Kingdom. This is because prisoners suspected of terrorism were held at the station for questioning. The building was a typical 1960s office block, but underneath the station were sixteen cells located below ground level, which have a separate custody suite from the building's other cells. Building work was completed in 1971.\u000aHigh-profile terrorist suspects arrested across the UK were often taken to Paddington Green Police Station for interrogation, and holding until escorted to a Court of Law. Suspects who have been held there include members of the IRA, the British nationals released from Guantanamo Bay, and the 21 July 2005 London bombers.\u000aOn 10 October 1992, a bomb was exploded in a phone box outside the police station, injuring one person.\u000aIn 2007, a joint parliamentary human rights committee stated that the old and decrepit mid-1960s police station was "plainly inadequate" to hold such high-risk prisoners. Lord Carlile, the official reviewer of the government's terrorism laws, said the Metropolitan Police needed a new custody suite suitable for up to 30 terrorism suspects. The old cells were 12-foot square, contained no windows and were reportedly too hot in the summer and too cold in winter. Refurbishments were made in 2009 at a cost of £490,000. Suspects now have access to an audio-visual system on which they can watch films and listen to music whilst incarcerated. This system was added because it was deemed inhumane to keep people locked up for to 28 days without any stimulation. One anti-terrorist officer was reported to be angry with these improvements saying, "If you beat up your wife or have a fight down the pub you will be slung in a cramped cell with nothing more than a toilet and a mattress. But if you are a terrorist intent on blowing things up then you get a luxurious cell with a telly and a CD player." The cells are lined with brown paper before suspects arrive so that any traces of explosives found on their bodies can be proven not to have been picked up from the cells.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a"Paddington Green Police Station".

aVNii-lante Augustus Kwamlah Quaye (3 September 1921 \u2013 13 March 2000), known professionally as Cab Kaye, was an English jazz singer and pianist of Ghanaian and Dutch descent. He combined blues, stride piano, and scat with his Ghanaian heritage.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Youth ==\u000aCab Kaye, also known as Cab Quay, Cab Quaye and Kwamlah Quaye, was born on St. Giles High Street in Camden, London to a musical family. His Ghanaian great-grandfather was an asafo warrior drummer and his grandfather, Henry Quaye, was an organist for the Methodist Mission church in the former Gold Coast, now called Ghana. Cab's mother, Doris Balderson, sang in English music halls and his father, Caleb Jonas Quaye (born 1895 in Accra, Ghana), performed under the name Ernest Mope Desmond as musician, band leader, pianist and percussionist. With his blues piano style, Caleb Jonas Quaye became popular around 1920 in London and Brighton with his band The Five Musical Dragons in Murray's Club with, among others, Arthur Briggs, Sidney Bechet and George "Bobo" Hines.\u000aWhen Kaye was four months old, his father was killed in a railway accident in Blisworth, Northamptonshire, on 27 January 1922, on his way to perform in a concert. Kaye, his mother, and his sister Norma moved to Portsmouth, where a life insurance policy provided temporary financial support. Between the ages of nine and twelve he spent three years in hospital while a tumor in his neck was irradiated. British radiation therapy was still in its infancy, and Kaye's treatment was experimental. A permanent scar remained on the left side of his neck.\u000aHis first instruments were timpani, introduced to him by a Canadian soldier who taught him how to count and use the mallets. At fourteen, Kaye began to visit nightclubs where black musicians were welcome, such as The Shim Sham and The Nest; he eventually won first prize in a song contest, a tour with the Billy Cotton band. During this tour, he met the African-American trombonist and tap dancer Ellis Jackson. Jackson convinced Cotton to engage Kaye as an assistant and as a singer in his band. Engaged as a tap dancer with Billy Cotton's show band in 1936, Kaye recorded his first song, "Shoe Shine Boy", under the name Cab Quay.\u000a\u000a\u000a== The war years ==\u000aDuring 1937 Kaye played drums and percussion with Doug Swallow and his band in April, the Hal Swain Band in the summer, and Alan Green's band in September in Hastings, England. Until 1940 he sang and drummed with the Ivor Kirchin Band, with Steve Race on piano, in the Paramount Dance Hall on Tottenham Court Road, London, where he was one of the only black people around. When a guest was refused entrance because of their skin colour, Kaye refused to perform. The incident led to the regular acceptance of black people, and the Paramount Dance Hall grew into a sort of "Harlem of London". After a short period with Britain's first black swing band leader, Ken "Snakehips" Johnson (and His Rhythm Swingers), Kaye played in several radio broadcasts. Shortly thereafter he joined the British Merchant Navy, which provided support services to the allies during World War II. Three days after Kaye enlisted, Ken "Snakehips" Johnson and saxophonist David Williams were killed on 8 March 1941, when a bomb fell on the Café de Paris nightclub in London's West End where they were performing. Around this time Kaye's mother was also killed when her house in Portsmouth was the only house on her street to be hit by a bomb.\u000aWhile on leave from the Merchant Navy, Kaye sang with Don Mario Barretto in London. His ship was hit by a torpedo in the Pacific Ocean in 1942. He was saved, but the convoy continued to be attacked by enemy ships, and during the following three nights two other ships were sunk. These experiences stayed with him for the rest of his life. En route to an Army hospital in New York he was hurt when his plane crashed before landing. While recuperating in New York, he went to concerts and played in clubs in Harlem and Greenwich Village with the trumpet player Roy Eldridge, trombonist Sandy Williams, Slam Stewart, Pete Brown, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Willie "The Lion" Smith. The story was told in a two-page article in Melody Maker (December 1942) headlined: \u201cTORPEDOED... SHIPWRECKED... INJURED... BUT HE MET ALL THE SWING STARS!\u201d After his return to London, Kaye sang in February and April 1943 with clarinettist Harry Parry, then with the "Princes of Rhythm",and formed a band that played in 1943 and 1944 in The Orchard Club on Wigmore Street and included a 16-year-old Ronnie Schatt (Ronnie Scott) on sax,and Ralph Sharon and Dick Katz on piano.\u000a\u000a\u000a== After the war ==\u000aIn 1946, Cab Kaye sang for the British troops in Egypt and India with Leslie "Jiver" Hutchinson's "All Coloured Band". After that, he performed as a singer and entertainer in Belgium. In 1947, he returned to London to sing in the bands of guitarist Vic Lewis, trombonist and bandleader Ted Heath, the bebop accordionist Tito Burns and the band "Jazz in the Town Hall". That year, Kaye was voted number thirteen by the readers of Melody Maker in their annual Jazz Poll.\u000aFrom 1948 he performed mainly as the orchestra leader of his own bands, such as "The Ministers of Swing", which featured saxophonists Ronnie Scott and Johnny Dankworth and the bebop guru pianist Denis Rose. For the new wave of London musicians from the West Indies, as well as the English musicians, Kaye was an inspiration as band leader. In 1949 he played with Tommy Pollard (piano, accordion, vibes), Cecil Jacob "Flash" Winston (drums, vocals and piano) and Paul Fenhoulet's Orchestra, a band that always included top jazz musicians. On 13 October 1949 Kaye recorded with clarinettist Keith Bird and The Esquire Six.\u000aIn this period he also led "Cab Kaye and his Coloured Orchestra" and co-led "The Cabinettes" with Ronnie Ball, featuring "blues singer" Mona Baptiste from Trinidad. Both of these bands played regularly in the Fabulous Feldman Club (100 Oxford Street, London), featuring Kaye on electric guitar. Kaye's band was, in 1948, the first musical ensemble featuring people of colour to play in Amsterdam's Concertgebouw. With his "All Coloured Band", featuring Dave Wilkins, Henry Shalofsky (Hank Shaw) and Sam Walker, Cab Kaye then toured in France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands in 1950 and 1951. In Paris at the end of the 1940s early 1950s, Kaye met Tadd Dameron, who was then playing with Miles Davis. Dameron gave Kaye his first and only piano lesson. In the Club St. Germain, Kaye played with guitarist Django Reinhardt, who had become more interested in bebop. Also in Paris, Cab reunited with Roy Eldridge, who introduced him to Don Byas, probably in Dick Edward's jazz club Ringside (later the Blue Note) on Rue Thérèse. The Ringside was frequented by such jazz musicians as pianist Art Simmons, Annie Ross (later of Lambert, Hendricks & Ross), saxophonist James Moody, Pierre Michelot (bassist, band leader and composer) and poet/vocalist Babs Gonzales.\u000aIn 1950 Kaye played in the Netherlands. "Cab Kaye's combo comes to Rotterdam", Cab Kaye and "seven negro musicians" as the Dutch jazz magazine Rhythm reported on 15 February 1950, "brings a program in the style of Louis Jordan, but also South American music and calypsos". Kaye played the entire month of March 1950 in the Rotterdam club Parkzicht with jazz trumpeter Dave Wilkins from Barbados, the Jamaican tenor saxophonist and clarinetist George Tyndale, Sam Walker (tenor sax), Cyril Johnson (piano), Rupert Nurse (bass), Cliff Anderson (drums) and Chico Eyo (bongos). While in the Netherlands, a performance with the "Skymasters" was recorded by the Dutch radio network AVRO in May 1950 (according to Melody Maker the performance was broadcast on 17 May 1950). In the same period a performance featuring Cab Kaye was broadcast on the television programme Music All In by the Dutch television and radio organisation TROS (see: Jazz & Improvised Music in the Netherlands, 1978).\u000aIn 1951, Kaye recorded with Astraschall records in Germany, with George Tyndale (tenor sax), Dave Wilkins (trumpet), Sam Walker (tenor sax), Cyril Johnson (piano), Owen Stephens (bass) and Aubrey Henry (drums). Kaye also regularly accompanied saxophonist Don Byas on piano in the early 1950s.\u000a\u000a\u000a== The 1950s and Hot Sauce ==\u000aBetween December 1950 and May 1951, Cab Kaye's Latin American Band was booked by Lou van Rees to tour France, Germany and The Netherlands (where Kaye met Charlie Parker, among other notables). In the Netherlands, Kaye played in the newly opened "Avifauna" in Alphen aan den Rijn, the world's first bird park. In a turn of fate, he first met his later wife Jeannette at Avifauna when she was a little girl. The reprise came 30 years later when Cab and Jeannette married.\u000aIn 1951 Kaye played a small role in the movie Sensation in San Remo, directed by Georg Jacoby. Although the New Musical Express announced "Cab Kaye gets Big Film Break" on 20 March 1953, the movie was not a success and soon disappeared from cinemas; though it was not to be his last time in front of a camera. Further exposure came with his shows in the Montpellier Buttery Club where, according to a flyer, he performed his "Afro-Cuban music" and organised dance contests - cha-cha, mambo and jive. Prizes were presented by jazz stars such as Tony Crombie and Ronnie Scott. In 1952 he recorded with the Gerry Moore Trio on the first of March and the Norman Burns Quintet on the seventeenth of May. From late 1952 to mid-1953 Cab played with drummer Tommy Jones from Liverpool and bassist/guitarist Brylo Ford from Trinidad. In 1953 Brylo Ford and Deacon Jones (drums) played in a trio of Cab's that was featured in the movie Blood Orange, directed by Terence Fisher.\u000aKaye led various multi-ethnic bands, usually consisting of musicians from British, African and West Indian origin. Later that year he was in the revue entitled "Memories of Jolson", a musical based on the life of Al Jolson, featuring sixteen-year-old Shirley Bassey. The show toured Scotland but Kaye pulled out after the first performance on the grounds of its racism. Kaye decided to focus increasingly on variety shows according to Melody Maker in 1953, and he founded a theatre booking agency, Black and White Productions Ltd, to book small theatre and film roles for himself and other musicians. His career as a businessman did not last long and he soon concentrated again on making music.\u000aA 5 July 1953 flyer from Jephson Gardens Pavilion announced Cab Kaye and his orchestra with a special attraction, "America's Queen of the Ivories\u201d Mary Lou Williams. The band featured; Dizzy Reece (trumpet), Pat Burke (tenor sax), Dennis Rose (piano), Denny Coffey (bass) and Dave Smallman (bongo & conga). They also accompanied the jitterbug and tap dancer Josephine (Josie) Woods, and performed as "Cab Kaye's jazz septet" at the London Palladium in 1953, as well as using other names. Several different types of appearances followed, including performances with "Old Black Magic" singer Billy Daniels and pianist Benny Payne (New Wimbledon Theatre, 26 July 1953).\u000aKaye performed in the Kurhaus at Scheveningen in The Netherlands in 1953. That same year, Melody Maker reported that a very hot sauce with a secret recipe, "Cab's secret" was sold in a number of shops on Archer Street (East Finchley) in London. Although popular among Cab's friends for many years, the sauce never became a commercial success. At the end of 1953, Cab formed a cabaret act with Josie Woods, "the Two Brown Birds of Rhythm". Again in Paris's "Ring Side" club, this time announced as "Kab Kay", he accompanied Eartha Kitt on piano. In April 1954 he played the role of "Kenneth \u2013 the coloured singer" in the film The Man Who Loved Redheads, written by Terence Rattigan, directed by Harold French and produced by British Lion Films. The film is about an innocent boy who meets a red-haired girl (Moira Shearer), and can't forget her. Kaye received a salary of £35 per day.\u000aDuring one of his tours of England (20 September 1954), he sang with a band led by pianist Ken Moule, and including Dave Usden (trumpet), Keith Barr, Roy Sidwell (tenor saxophone), Don Cooper (bass), Arthur Watts (bass) and Lennie Breslaw (drums). Again contracted by impresario Lou van Rees, he toured the Netherlands in 1955\u20131956 and performed at the Flying Dutchman club in Scheveningen. Lou van Rees had the idea to form a big band with 12 band leaders who were not often heard on the Dutch radio; including Wil Hensbergen (Wil Hensbergen Orchestra), Max Woiski Sr. (La Cubana Orchestra), vibraphonist Eddy Sanchez (Swiss Air Trio), Johnny Kraaykamp (leader of the One Man Band), Wessel Ilcken and Cab Kaye.\u000aAlso in 1956 "showman" Kaye played in Amsterdam's Sheherazade jazz club with his "All Star Quintet", consisting of Rob Pronk (piano), Toon van Vliet (tenor sax), Dub Dubois (bass) and drummer Wally Bishop. The club, nicknamed "Zade" by friends, was located in the Wagenstraat until 1962 and was a popular meeting place for jazz musicians. Later in 1956 Kaye toured Germany, and played in Hamburg, Düsseldorf and Köln, followed in 1957 by a tour of England with the Eric Delaney Band Show with Marion Williams.\u000aKaye performed in "Cab's Quintet" on the British BBC television program Six-Five Special on 31 August 1957 (season 1, episode 29); with Laurence "Laurie" Deniz (1st guitar) and his brother Joe Deniz (2nd guitar), Pete Blannin (bass) and Harry South (piano). Around this time Kaye also performed in Oh Boy!, the first British teenage all-music show. Oh Boy was an ABC/ITV show produced by Jack Good, who had earlier produced Six-Five Special on which Kaye had appeared. That same year, Kaye was voted eleventh in Melody Maker's Jazz Music Magazine Poll. Kaye featured again on Six-Five Special on 1 March 1958 (season 1, episode 57). In 1959 he joined the ensemble of Humphrey Lyttelton in London, which led to the recording of the album Humph Meets Cab (March 1960), with his characteristic witty vocals on pieces such as "Let Love Lie Sleeping".\u000aThe Manchester Evening News announced on 25 August 1960 that the next day's BBC TV Jazz Session was to feature the Dill Quintet, the Bob Wallis Storyville Jazzmen and singer Cab Kaye. In the same year Kaye came ninth in Melody Maker's Jazz Poll.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Swinging diplomat ==\u000aOn 6 March 1957, the Gold Coast became Ghana - the first sub-Saharan African country to gain its independence. Three years later, on 6 March 1960, Kwame Nkrumah became president of the republic. For Cab Kaye, Ghana's independence was an important political symbol. Two family members in high government positions, Tawia Adamafio and C. T. Nylander, had brought Kaye into contact with Ghanaian politics. During Nkrumah's reign, Kaye was appointed as the Government Entertainments Officer, and from 1961 worked at the Ghana High Commission in London as protocol officer. As such, he played a role in getting a Ghanaian passport for Miriam Makeba, whose South African passport had been revoked under the country's apartheid regime.\u000aProbably partly influenced by both racist experiences and euphoria over Ghana's Independence, he discarded the Anglicised version of his name, Cab Kaye, and called himself Kwamlah Quaye - though some newspapers missed the "h". While his day job was working in the Ghanaian High Commission, he played at night in Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. A farewell special for Cab Kaye, entitled Swinging Diplomat, was broadcast by the BBC in August 1961. A farewell party was organised for Kaye in Ronnie Scott's club, using the slogan "He's goin 'home' with the best jazz in town".\u000aBefore leaving for Ghana, Kaye and his "Kwamlah Quaye Sextetto Africana" recorded "Everything Is Go" - the song he had written with William "Bill" Davis. With this band he made the first recordings in which he played guitar. This group consisted of: guitarist Laurence Deniz on bass, born in Cardiff in 1924 to a father from Cape Verde; Chris O'Brien, bongos, and Frank Holder - both from British Guiana (now Guyana) and served in the Royal Air Force (RAF); and Chris Ajilo on claves. "Everything is Go" was a tribute to the American astronaut John Glenn, with its "get set, blast off, this man is heading for space" being a cheerful calypso piece, strangely interwoven with the melancholy of the astronautical euphoria of the sixties. The number was played at the opening of the exhibition of the Space Shuttle in Accra on 29 May 1962 by Joe Mensah. On 17 February 1962 Kaye gained fourth place in the Melody Maker poll of leading jazz musicians. Kaye left London with big plans to work for the Ghanaian Industrial Development Corporation (IDC). On arriving in Accra, he formed a duo with singer Mary Hyde, with whom he regularly performed in the Star and other hotels in Accra.\u000aKaye performed during a visit by Queen Elizabeth II to Ghana in November 1961. As Entertainments Manager for Ghana Hotels Ltd., Kaye was less successful. Although the concerts he organised were well visited, he could not get the dance competitions on Sunday and Monday off the ground. This was reported in the Ghanaian Times (26 April 1962), which caused Kaye to finish his contract shortly afterwards. Back in the Star Hotel in 1963, he joined with drummer Guy Warren (later known as "Kofi Ghanaba") and the folk singer and activist Pete Seeger who was on a world tour, and popular in Ghana for his statements about the equality of the black Americans. Kaye played in Accra (including the famous Tip-Toe Gardens) and in Lagos, alternating with performances in New York (e.g. in the Village Door in Long Island). On 7 August 1964 he played with the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and his quintet in a charity program to support African culture called O'Pataki - Pataki in the Yoruba language can be translated as "important".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Politics ==\u000aIn the early 1960s the Ghanaian Ramblers Dance Band covered Kaye's highlife song "Beautiful Ghana" under the new title "Work and Happiness". This song, released by Decca Recordings, West Africa, was frequently played during Kwame Nkrumah's regime as part of the political "Work and Happiness" program.\u000aNkrumah was deposed in 1966 after a military coup, which left Cab Kaye and other supporters of the previous regime in a difficult situation. He had to explain his political views behind the "Work and Happiness" song. Fortunately his sister Norma had married Dr J. T. Nelson-Cole in Nigeria, and offered Kaye a new home base in Lagos. This was the end of his political career, but the Pan-Africanism of Kwame Nkrumah, calling for a politically united Africa, would remain one of the few political ideals that Kaye supported for the rest of his life.\u000aHe did not disengage entirely from political life. From 1965 Kaye played alternately in New York, Europe and Africa. He made good use of his cultural background from Africa and Europe. In the New York Amsterdam News (18 January 1965) he had a letter printed with the lines: "I am proud, I am African [...] I am proud, I am black". This text, signed by Nii Lante Quaye (657 Crotona Park, Bronx) was consistent with the ideas of the emerging Black Power movement.\u000aHe was announced in New York under the name "Nii Lante Quaye" as a special act, as he was in a flyer announcing Cab Kaye as a guest artist in the show of Ed Nixon Jr (Nick La Tour) in St. Stephan's Methodist Church, Broadway, on 22 May 1966. The show master Cab Kaye was announced in Ghanaian flyers of this time as "MC" (Master of Ceremony) Cab Kaye. He performed regularly on Ghanaian and Nigerian radio and television: on 16 November 1966 in It's Time for Show Biz with the Spree City Stompers from Berlin; on 6 January 1967 with \u201cthe Paramount Eight Dance Band" on Ghanaian television's Bandstand; and on 30 July 1967 as MC at the international pop festival in Accra. In May 1968 he performed with his nephews, the Nelson Cole brothers, in Lagos, and then touring through Nigeria. The Nelson Cole brothers were his sister Norma's sons, who formed the Soul Assembly with other artists. In 1996 Kaye played again in Lagos at the Federal Palace Hotel in a program including Fela Kuti and highlife bandleader Bobby Benson.\u000aFollowing his return to England in 1970, he discovered that his daughter Terri Quaye (also known as Theresa Naa-Koshie), his eldest son Caleb Quaye and his band Hookfoot, were now better known than himself from their own musical careers. He began his second London career in Mike Leroy's Chez Club Cleo in Knightsbridge, accompanied by Clive Cooper (bass) and Cecil "Flash" Winston (drums). Kaye soon became a much-requested presence on the London jazz circuit. His daughter Terri, who started singing with her father and his bebop jazz band as a young girl, accompanied him at some events. Around 1973 he was accompanied by Mike Greaves (drums, percussion), Phil Bates (bass) and Ray Dempsey (guitar). The following year he was one of the attractions at the Black Arts Festival 1974, organised by the Commonwealth Institute in London. He also made regular appearances at the BBC Club (an exclusive club for BBC employees) with bassist Phil Bates and drummer Tony Crombie.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Amsterdam: Cab Kaye's Jazz Piano Bar ==\u000a\u000aIn the late 1970s, Kaye moved to Amsterdam and became a member of Buma/Stemra (the Dutch copyright organisation that oversees distribution of royalties) and the Dutch Association of Professional Improvising Musicians (BIM). In Amsterdam he performed with jazz musicians such as singer Babs Gonzales, funk-jazz flautist Wally Shorts, trombonist Bert Koppelaar, bassist Wilbur Little and conductor Boy Edgar (in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw). In the early years in Amsterdam, he rented an apartment from jazz saxophonist Rosa King and became known on the local jazz scene.\u000aKaye opened his own jazz club in the centre of Amsterdam on 1 October 1979, "Cab Kaye's Jazz Piano Bar" at Beulingstraat 9, with his Dutch wife Jeannette. When not touring Poland, Portugal and Iceland, he performed five nights a week in his own Piano Bar, a meeting place for jazz musicians. Frequent visitors included Rosa King, trombonist Slide Hampton, television doctor and saxophonist Aart Gisolf, guitarist Dirk-Jan "Bubblin" Toorop, pianist David Mayer, singer Gerrie van der Klei, jazz pianist Cameron Japp, Max Roach, Oscar Peterson, Pia Beck and others. During this period Kaye gave many concerts in the Netherlands, including several with Max "Teawhistle" Teeuwisse in Den Oever, and four times at the North Sea Jazz Festival. The first North Sea Jazz Festival performance was with his Cab Kaye Quartet on 16 July 1978, the second was on 10 July 1981 with Akwaba Cab Kaye and his Afro Jazz, the third was in July 1982 accompanied by Aart Gisolf and Nippy Noya, and the last was as a soloist on 10 July 1983.\u000aKaye regularly performed at the Victoria Hotel, Amsterdam in the second half of the 1980s. On 10 October 1987 he participated in the Night of Hilversum, a charity event against polio organised by the Rotary Club, WHO and UNICEF. On 21 May 1988 "Cab Kaye's Jazz Piano Bar" closed and he began to be heard in public much less often. His final significant performance was on 8 September 1996 at the Bimhuis in Amsterdam. Many musicians and jazz lovers, including Herman Openneer, Pim Gras, the Dutch jazz drummer John Engels and Rosa King, organised a birthday party for the then 75-year-old pianist. He was unable to sing due to his mouth floor cancer, but enthusiastically played piano and jammed with many musicians. He subsequently performed sporadically in smaller venues and privately in Amsterdam's Dapperbuurt. The last time Cab Kaye played piano (including "Jeannette You Are My Love") was on 12 March 2000, at home with Rosa King.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Private life ==\u000aAlthough born in London, Kaye considered himself African. He had three marriages; first in 1939 to Theresa Austin, a jazz singer and daughter of a sailor from Barbados. Cab and Theresa often performed together. The couple had two daughters, Terri Quaye (born 8 November 1940, Bodmin), Tanya Quaye and a son, Caleb Quaye (born 1948, London). Cab met his second wife, a Nigerian named Evelyn, in the 1960s in Ghana. Together, they moved back to England. After a brief affair in 1973 with Sharon McGowan, he had a son, Finley Quaye (born 25 March 1974, Edinburgh). Cab Kaye met his son Finley as an adult in 1997 following a concert of Finley's in the rock music venue and cultural centre Paradiso Amsterdam. After the concert Cab sent a messenger with a message for Finley written carefully and painstakingly on a parchment scroll. The messenger read the message to Finley and he and Cab Kaye met the following morning with Finley's band members band at the house Cab shared with his wife Jeannette in Amsterdam.\u000aThree generations \u2013 grandfather Caleb Jonas Quaye (Ernest Mope Desmond), Kwamlah Quaye (Cab Kaye) and youngest son Finley Quaye \u2013 have all played, at different times, at Glasgow's Barrowlands, Wolverhampton's Wulfrun Hall and London's Cafe de Paris. His third wife, Jeannette, was Dutch. After marrying, he decided to settle in the Netherlands and became a Dutch citizen.\u000aIn the 1990s, Kaye was diagnosed with mouth floor cancer with the result that he lost the ability to speak. Until his death at the age of 78 (13 March 2000) in the Dapperbuurt, Kaye lived in Amsterdam, where he was cremated. His ashes were scattered in the North Sea and in Accra.\u000aCab Kaye's motto was: "Truth is stranger than f(r)iction (excuse my diction, I walk with a lisp)."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discography ==\u000aBilly Cotton and his band- 27 August 1936 \u2013 CAR-4150-1 / Regal Zonophone MR2189\u000a"Shoe-Shine boy" \u2013 Cab Quay (vocals)\u000a\u000aBilly Cotton & his orchestra \u2013 A Nice Cup of Tea; Volume 2 \u2013 recorded 1936\u20131941 (1CD0198188 BD5 VOCALION \u2013 new release September 2001 \u2013 Vocalion CDEA 6053)\u000a"A Little Bit Later On" \u2013 Cab Quay (vocals)\u000a\u000aJazz at the Town Hall Ensemble \u2013 30 March 1948 (Esquire Records 10-032) \u2013 Ronnie Scott (ts), Johnny Dankworth (as), Reg Arnold (tp), Dennis Rose (p, tp), Jimmy Skidmore (ts), Bernie Fenton (p), Joe Muddel (b), Jack Fallon (b), Carlo Krahmer (d), Cab Kaye (vocals)\u000a"If You'se a Viper"\u000a"That's My Desire"\u000a\u000aKeith Bird and The Esquire Six \u2013 13 October 1949 (Eng.

aVMonthly income preferred stock or MIPS is a hybrid security created by Eli Jacobson, a Sullivan & Cromwell tax partner, and introduced to the market by Goldman Sachs in 1993. In essence, MIPS is a combination of deeply subordinated debt and preferred stock.\u000aMIPS is structured in such a way as to make payments on the security an interest expense for the borrower and dividend for the lender. A special purpose entity of the issuer sells the preferred stock to the public and then lends the proceeds to the parent. The parent's interest payments to the subsidiary are tax-deductible as interest and are used by the SPE to pay preferred dividends to the investors. However, the interest income received by the SPE is not taxable income, because it is organized as a tax-free entity.\u000aBecause of these features, MIPS at one point dominated the market for traditional perpetual preferred equity, accounting for over 70% of all new preferred issues. However, MIPS as a tax shelter no longer works. The credit rating agencies consider MIPS to be preferred stock.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aRealty Income Declares Monthly Income Preferred Stock Dividends\u000aPopular, Inc. - Noncumulative Monthly Income Preferred Stock 2003 Series A\u000aTraditional And Synthetic Preferreds Provide More Choices For Individual Investor

aVKaitlyn ni Donovan is an American classically trained violinist and composer of experimental music, dream pop, and film scores, hailing from Portland, Oregon. She is self-taught on a multitude of instruments and is known for unorthodox chord changes and lyrics peppered with dense language and romantic imagery. She sings in a style that is angelic and sparse and is sometimes compared to Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins. In the mid 1990s she performed regularly with a large group of players under her own name. These performances included strings, toy pianos, acoustic and electric instruments. This sound would become known as chamber pop or baroque pop in the Northwest music scene.\u000aIn 1999, Hush Records released ni Donovan's Songs for Three Days. Produced by Tony Lash, Three Days and the compilation Flag would launch Hush toward national distribution.\u000aIn 2000, ni Donovan joined the shoegazing band, The High Violets.\u000aIn 2007, she and her partner, Jonathan Drews, opened a recording studio, named Last of the Explorers, where they focus on music and film score production.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Releases ==\u000a1999 Songs for 'Three Days (Hush Records)\u000a1996 Dinner with Bosch (New Weave Records)\u000a1993 Cannible Spirit (Cannible Music)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Compilations ==\u000aSongs For Fairy Tales\u000aRoss Island Bridge "Volume 1: The Process Is Now The Work"\u000aAnother Grey Christmas\u000aThe Church of Northwest Music Volume 1\u000aNW Shoegazers Compilations 1, 2 and 3\u000aNew Weave Records "Time Code"\u000aMore A Hush Compilation\u000aMass A Hush Compilation\u000aFlag A Hush Compilation\u000aRead": Interpreting Björk\u000aMile": A Hush Compilation\u000aDECA": A Hush Compilation\u000a\u000a\u000a== Guest musician recordings ==\u000aBoston Spaceships "Let It Beard"\u000aClass M Planets \u201c5 Songs\u201d\u000aPerhapst \u201cRevise Your Maps\u201d\u000aBoston Spaceships "Camera Found The Ray Gun"\u000aBoston Spaceships "Zero To 99"\u000aLoch Lomond "Night Bats"\u000aRoss Island Bridge "Volume 1: The Process Is Now The Work"\u000aBoston Spaceships "Planets Are Blasted"\u000aBlanket Music "Nice"\u000aFancie "A Negative Capability"\u000aKing Black Acid "Loves A Long Song"\u000aLoch Lomond "Paper The Walls"\u000aMonde la Bella "Exquisite Corpse"\u000aOblivion Seekers "Snake Eyes"\u000aParks and Recreation "What Was She Doing On The Shore That Night"\u000athebrotheregg "Aortic Mor"\u000aThe State Flowers "Third Of July"\u000aSugarboom "The Liars Circus"\u000a\u000a\u000a== The High Violets discography ==\u000aDream Away EP (1999)\u000a44 Down Reverb Records, (2002)\u000aTo Where You Are Reverb Records, (2006)\u000aSatellite Remixes Reverb Records, (2007)\u000aCinéma Comet Rock Records, (2010)\u000aHeroes and Halos Saint Marie, (2016)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aLast of The Explorers: Official site for Kaitlyn Ni Donovan's film scores\u000aKaitlyn Ni Donovan at Internet Movie Database\u000aHush Records\u000aThe High Violets:Official Site\u000aReverb Records\u000aEctophiles' Guide To Good Music: Kaitlyn ni Donovan\u000aEctophiles' Guide To Good Music: The High Violets

aVLickey Grange is a Victorian house and estate in the village of Lickey near Birmingham, England, where the automobile manufacturer Herbert Austin lived for 31 years. It later became a residential school and is now private housing.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Herbert Austin ==\u000aThe early history of Lickey Grange is not known. Herbert Austin founded the Austin Motor Company, at Longbridge, in 1905 and he moved his family to Lickey Grange in 1910. His new home included 100 acres (40 ha) of surrounding land; and a lodge.\u000aHe had worked as an Engineer at the Wolseley Sheep Shearing Company in Australia and returned to England with his Australian wife in 1893 to become Manager of its manufacturing operations in Aston, Birmingham. He extended the range of the company but continued as manager of both parts. The new part became known in 1901 as the Wolseley Tool and Motor Company; and he had designed its first car. He left the Wolseley Tool and Motor company in 1905, bringing two former Wolseley designers with him to his new company at Longbridge, which was then in the countryside, in Worcestershire. However, he continued working for the Wolseley Sheep and Shearing Company; and was Chairman from 1911 to 1931.\u000aBetween 1893 and 1910 Herbert Austin had lived in various parts of Birmingham. By 1910 the family, two daughters and a son, moved to Lickey Grange where he spent the rest of his life.\u000aThe Austin 7 was designed at Lickey Grange between 1921 and 1922 in the billiards room (but not on the billiards table!). This was a 7 horsepower (hp) car. It had been designed in private, at Sir Herbert Austin's expense, at Lickey Grange because the other directors of the Austin Motor company preferred bigger 12 hp-engined cars and were against the idea of a "small" car. Herbert Austin patented some of the features and so gained a royalty for every Austin 7 sold by the company. Stanley Edge, the young design draughtsman who worked for Sir Herbert, lived at the Lodge but ate his meals in the adjoining library.\u000aHerbert Austin died in 1941 and was buried in the graveyard of Lickey Church. The Grange was later sold.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Birmingham Royal Institution for the Blind ==\u000aThe Birmingham Royal Institution for the Blind (BRIB), a charity, then took over Lickey Grange and the first pupils moved-in in March 1953. The BRIB's school had previously been at Carpenter Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, but this site was acquired by the BBC, (firstly Outside broadcasting in 1954, then the Regional HQ in 1955), forcing the move to Lickey Grange.\u000aThe BRIB kept the house much the same as it had been, but the grounds were developed to meet the needs of a residential school. Individual houses were built for teachers, Hostel blocks were built for the pupils, plus an assembly hall, indoor swimming pool and class rooms.\u000aThe school catered for a mixture of residential and day pupils. Until the 1980s there were more residential pupils than day pupils; however changes in the methods of education - integration - lead to a large drop in the numbers of children being sent to the school.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Redevelopment ==\u000aThe house is Victorian with the large rooms, such as a library and a billiards room. After the BRIB vacated the site it was redeveloped with teachers' houses nearest to the Old Birmingham Road sold off first. The rest of the site is now a gated community of up-market homes.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Access ===\u000aLickey Grange is accessed from the Old Birmingham Road (B4096). The B4096 appears to have once formed the route of the A38, but the A38 now bypasses Lickey.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aSharratt, Barney, (2000).

aVHurricane Catarina (Portuguese pronunciation: [kata\u02c8\u027ein\u0250]) was an extremely rare South Atlantic tropical cyclone that hit Southern Brazil in late March 2004. The storm developed out of a stationary cold-core upper-level trough on March 12. Almost a week later, on March 19, a disturbance developed along the trough and traveled towards the east-southeast until March 22 when a ridge stopped the forward motion of the disturbance. The disturbance was in an unusually favorable environment with a little bit below-average wind shear and above-average sea surface temperatures. The combination of the two led to a slow transition from an extratropical cyclone to a subtropical cyclone by March 24. The storm continued to obtain tropical characteristics and became a tropical storm the next day while the winds steadily increased. The storm attained wind speeds of 75 mph (120 km/h)\u2014equivalent to a low-end Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale\u2014on March 26. At this time it was unofficially named Catarina and was also the first hurricane-intensity tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Unusually favorable conditions persisted and Catarina continued to intensify and was estimated to have peaked with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) on March 28. The center of the storm made landfall later that day at the time between the cities of Passo de Torres and Balneário Gaivota, Santa Catarina. Catarina rapidly weakened upon landfall and dissipated the next day.\u000aSince Catarina was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in Brazil since the beginning of reliable records, and hence infrastructure and the population were not specifically prepared for it, the damage was quite severe. Although the storm was an unprecedented event, Brazilian officials took the appropriate actions and warned the public about the approaching storm. Residents heeded the warnings and prepared for the storm by either evacuating or by riding it out in their homes. Catarina ended up destroying 1,500 homes and damaging around 40,000 others. Agricultural products were severely damaged: 85% of the banana crops and 40% of the rice crops were lost in the storm. Three people were confirmed to have perished in the storm and 185 others were injured. Damages from the storm amounted to $350 million (2004 USD, $453 million 2018 USD).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Meteorological history ==\u000a\u000aOn March 12, a cold-core stationary upper-level trough became established offshore of southern Brazil. A disturbance formed within the trough on the 19th, and moved east-southeastward until the 22nd, when a ridge to its southeast kept it stationary. With exceptionally favorable upper level winds and slightly below average, if marginally warm, water temperatures from 24 to 26 °C (75 to 79 °F), it gradually developed, resembling a subtropical storm by the 24th. Located 630 mi (1,015 km) east-southeast of Florianópolis, it headed slowly westward, and appeared to become a tropical storm on March 25.\u000aA compact storm, it continued westward while steadily intensifying. The structure of the storm continued to improve and due to a definite eye feature showing on satellites, the storm was determined to have become a hurricane-equivalent cyclone on March 26. A Brazilian newspaper had a headline "Furacão Catarina" (i.e. "hurricane [threatening the state of Santa] Catarina"). Partly because of this headline, the storm was unofficially named Catarina. It continued to encounter favorable conditions and reached a peak of 100 mph (155 km/h) estimated sustained winds on the 28th, which made the storm the equivalent of a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Gusts peaked at around 120 mph (195 km/h). The hurricane hit the southern coast of Santa Catarina and northeastern Rio Grande do Sul with winds up to 195 km/h overnight. After making landfall, Catarina rapidly dissipated over land, in the normal manner of a tropical cyclone.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Naming ==\u000a\u000aBrazilian meteorologists named the storm Catarina for its proximity to (and eventual landfall near) the state of Santa Catarina, although government forecasters initially denied that the storm, which clearly had an open eye and various other tropical morphologies, was a hurricane at all. More than a year after the storm made landfall, Brazilian meteorologists finally classified the storm as a tropical cyclone.\u000aNorth American forecasters, however surprised as they were, considered this storm a hurricane immediately upon reviewing the satellite-derived evidence. Since Catarina had a clear eyewall structure bounded by deep convective, dense central overcast, well-defined spiral outer bands and outflow structure, warm water temperatures of 79 °F (26 °C), little shear, a warm core low, overall tropical characteristics, and occurred in March (equivalent to September in the Northern Hemisphere, the peak of hurricane season), it was considered to be a hurricane by the National Hurricane Center in the United States.\u000aThough it is most commonly known as Catarina, all names for this storm are "unofficial," in that no World Meteorological Organization-affiliated meteorological agency that monitors hurricanes named it. (Tropical cyclone names are predetermined by an international committee of the World Meteorological Organization.) It has also been unofficially called "Aldonça", and the advisory names for it were "01T-ALPHA" from the United Kingdom's Met Office, and "50L-NONAME" from the United States' National Hurricane Center, which keeps it well outside normal designation, which start at 01L for named storms and use 90L to 99L for invests.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Rare formation ==\u000aTypically, tropical cyclones do not form in the South Atlantic Ocean, due to strong upper level shear, cool water temperatures, and the lack of a convergence zone of convection. Occasionally though, as seen in 1991 and early 2004, conditions can become slightly more favorable. For Catarina, it was a combination of climatic and atmospheric anomalies. Water temperatures on Catarina's path ranged from 24 to 25 °C, slightly less than the 26.5 °C temperature of a normal tropical cyclone, but sufficient for a storm of baroclinic origin.\u000aTo this day, Catarina is the only hurricane strength tropical cyclone ever observed in the South Atlantic Ocean since 1970. Other systems have been observed in this region; however, none have reached hurricane strength, and no eyes were seen on satellite imagery or radar. While Catarina formed in an unusual area, its relation to global warming or any other type of global climatic change is still up for debate. The Brazilian Society of Meteorology attributed it to "climatic changes and atmospheric anomalies," while other researchers have indicated that it could be the result of the Southern Annular Mode or other seasonal variations in weather within the Southern Hemisphere, again linked to global changes in climate. However, more research in the area is still needed to make a conclusion.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Impact ==\u000a\u000aLike normal tropical cyclones, Catarina brought heavy flooding with it. Despite the uncertainty in the future of the storm, Brazilian officials took the appropriate actions to ensure the safety of the residents who lived along the coastline. A successful evacuation was executed for numerous residents along the coast, though some people decided to ride out the storm in their own homes. The storm damaged around 40,000 homes and destroyed 1,500; 40% of the rice crop were also lost. Total damages were estimated at $350 million (2004 USD, $453 million 2018 USD). It also killed at least three and injured at least 75. At least 2,000 people were left homeless following the storm.\u000aAt Passo de Torres, many shipyards were destroyed, as they were not designed to withstand the pressure differentials caused by Catarina's winds; widespread roof damage was reported at this municipality as well. Near the Mampituba River, a house was blown about 50 meters (165 ft) upstream, literally landing in another state: it originally was built in the Torres municipality of Rio Grande do Sul, yet it ended up in Passo de Torres, within Santa Catarina. In rural areas, the corn, banana, and rice fields received the most damage, although rice farmers were able to partially recoup their losses, as they had harvested before Catarina made landfall.\u000aOverall, almost 36,000 residences were damaged as a result of Catarina's onslaught; of those, 993 collapsed completely. The commercial sector fared slightly better, as only 2,274 buildings were damaged and 472 collapsed. Finally, 397 public buildings were damaged and three were destroyed. These account for 26% of the total buildings in the region, and property damage of $25.6 million (2004 USD $332 million 2018 USD). Four-fifths of the damaged houses had some sort of roof failure or collapse. Most of the damage was blamed on the low quality of the construction; brick residences typically lacked plaster, beams, or columns, for example. The areas affected the most were those inhabited by low-income families, usually with annual family salaries of less than $400 USD.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aSouth Atlantic tropical cyclones\u000aSubtropical Storm Arani (2011) \u2013 The first system officially named by the Brazilian Navy\u000aMediterranean tropical-like cyclones\u000aCyclone Qendresa\u000a2006 Central Pacific cyclone\u000a1996 Lake Huron cyclone\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aMcTaggart-Cowan, Ron; Lance F.

aVThe River Calder (Scottish Gaelic: Caladar) is a left bank tributary of the River Spey in the Scottish Highlands. Its headwaters are the an t-Allt Ballach, Allt an Lochain Dubh and Allt Madagain which drain the mountain slopes at the southeastern corner of the Monadhliath. Their waters are added to by those of the Allt Fionndraigh and Allt a' Chaorainn dropping down into Glen Banchor from the north. The river turns southeastwards and skirts the western edge of Newtonmore, running beneath the A86 road before joining the Spey at Spey Bridge.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Etymology ==\u000aThe name 'Calder' may signify 'hard' or 'rapid water' from the Brythonic words caled and dobhar.

Ypsilantis was known for the co-discovery of the antiproton in 1955, along with Owen Chamberlain, Emilio Segrè, and Clyde Wiegand. Following this work, he moved to CERN to develop Cherenkov radiation detectors for use in particle physics.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aTom Ypsilantis was born in Salt Lake City in 1928. His father was killed by lightning in 1931. He graduated from South High School in 1945, and attended the University of Utah graduating with a degree in chemistry in 1949. He then attended the University of California, Berkeley where he joined the four person team at the Berkeley Bevatron that observed the first antiproton; this became the subject of his PhD thesis and the two senior members of this team won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1959. Ypsilantis was Associate Professor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley, and was instrumental in the founding of the Demokritos Research Center in Athens, Greece. In 1969, he went to Geneva to work at CERN (Centre European Research Nucleaire), where he met Jacques Séguinot. In 1977, Ypsilantis and Séguinot proposed the technique later called the Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) counter. Together with Tord Ekelöf, they introduced this technique for high-energy physics: the first large-scale application was for the DELPHI experiment at LEP. They later worked in the framework of the LAAS Project on noble-liquid calorimetry and on a very large water neutrino detector based on the fast-RICH technique. Ypsilantis also made major contributions to the LHCb experiment at CERN. He served as the Senior Research Director in Geneva, Project Director in Bologna, Italy, and Consultant to the French Nuclear Agency in Sauclay, France.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aobituary

aVRui "Louis" Hachimura (\u516b\u6751 \u5841, Hachimura Rui, born February 8, 1998 in Toyama Prefecture) is a Beninese-Japanese basketball player. He stands 6'8" (203 cm) tall and plays forward. Hachimura played at the Meisei High School in Japan and joined Gonzaga University in the United States beginning in the 2016\u201317 season.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Youth career ==\u000aHachimura played baseball before picking up basketball. In his native Japan, he was quickly regarded as a prodigy and a basketball sensation.\u000aHachimura was invited to play in the 2015 Jordan Brand Classic International Game. Coming off the bench, he had nine points, five rebounds and a blocked shot in 18 minutes of play.\u000aIn December 2015, Hachimura led Meisei High School to its third straight title in the All-Japan High School Tournament.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Recruiting ===\u000a\u000aIn December 2014, Hachimura expressed his desire to play college basketball in the United States. In January 2015, Hachimura was highlighted by ESPN among five of the best international players in the 2015 and 2016 classes with aspirations to play college basketball. He was drawing major interest from Arizona, Gonzaga, and Vanderbilt at the time, and scouts were impressed with his length, athleticism, and shooting ability.\u000aAfter taking visits to Gonzaga and Arizona, in November 2015 he signed a National Letter of Intent to play for Gonzaga University, "the most prestigious college program a Japanese player will have ever suited up for", according to the Japan Times.\u000aDespite signing with Gonzaga in the early signing period for 2016, Hachimura's eligibility to play college basketball was called into question. Concerns were that he needed to acclimate better culturally and language-wise to the United States, and he would potentially need to attend a prep school before attending Gonzaga or redshirting if eligible. In February 2016, Hachimura claimed to understand 80 percent of English, but was only able to speak 30 to 40 percent of it. As of April 2016, Hachimura was still working toward passing the SAT to gain entrance to college. In May 2016, Hachimura announced that he met the SAT and GPA requirements to be eligible to play at Gonzaga beginning as early as Fall 2016. He planned to play as a true freshman and not redshirt his first year.\u000a\u000a\u000a== College career ==\u000aHachimura played his first game for Gonzaga on November 5, 2016 against West Georgia, scoring nine points while tallying three rebounds in eleven minutes of play. During his freshman season as a Bulldog, Hachimura saw action in 28 games, averaging 2.6 points and 1.4 rebounds a game in 4.6 minutes. He also became the first Japanese native ever to play in the NCAA Division I men's tournament.\u000a\u000a\u000a== International career ==\u000aHe represents Japan internationally. At the 2013 FIBA Asia U16 Championship in Iran, Hachimura averaged 22.8 points, 12.6 rebounds and 2.8 blocks through eight contests, guiding his team to a third-place finish. In April 2014, he played the Albert-Schweitzer-Tournament in Germany with Japan's under 18 national team, finishing in last place.\u000aJapan finished the 2014 FIBA U17 World Championships 14th of 16 teams, with Hachimura scoring a tournament-high 22.6 points per game, while pulling down 6.6 boards and blocking 1.7 shots a contest. During the tournament, he dropped 25 points on the USA team that went on to win the title; that team included four players who were chosen in the 2017 NBA draft in Jayson Tatum, Josh Jackson, Caleb Swanigan, and Ivan Rabb, plus other future college stars such as Diamond Stone and Malik Newman.\u000aHe competed for Japan in the 2017 FIBA Under-19 Basketball World Cup, averaging team-bests 20.6 points and 11.0 rebounds a contest.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aHis mother is Japanese while his father comes from Benin.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aGonzaga Bulldogs bio

aVThe Maryhill Stonehenge is a replica of England\u2019s Stonehenge located in Maryhill, Washington. It was commissioned in the early 20th century by the wealthy entrepreneur Sam Hill, and dedicated on its original site on 4 July 1918 as a memorial to the people who had died in World War I.\u000aThe memorial is constructed of concrete, and completed in 1918. It was re-installed in its present site near Hill's home in 1929.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Historical significance ==\u000aThe Maryhill Stonehenge was the first monument in the United States to honor the dead of World War I \u2013 specifically, soldiers from Klickitat County, Washington who had died in the then on-going war. The altar stone is placed to be aligned with sunrise on the summer solstice.\u000aFollowing the then-prevalent interpretation of Stonehenge, Hill thought that the original monument had been used as a sacrificial site. He was a Quaker, and commissioned the replica as a reminder that humanity is still being sacrificed to the god of war. \u000aThe monument was originally located within Maryhill; the town later burned down, leaving only the concrete replica standing. The memorial was moved to its current site on Sam Hill\u2019s farm, overlooking the Columbia Gorge. A second formal dedication of the monument took place upon its completion on 30 May 1929. Sam Hill died in 1931, but lived long enough to see the re-installation of his Stonehenge replica completed.\u000aThe dedication plaque on this Washington Stonehenge is inscribed:\u000a\u000aIn memory of the soldiers of Klickitat County who gave their lives in defense of their country. This monument is erected in the hope that others inspired by the example of their valor and their heroism may share in that love of liberty and burn with that fire of patriotism which death can alone quench.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Current status ==\u000aThe Maryhill Stonehenge is now part of the Maryhill Museum of Art, which also includes monuments to the soldiers of Klickitat County who died in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.\u000aThis concrete landmark is located off U.S. Highway 97, about two miles from where it enters Washington from Oregon, by crossing the Columbia River.

Swindon were joined in the relegation zone by Sheffield United and Oldham Athletic.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Robson quits Old Trafford ===\u000aBryan Robson left Manchester United after 13 years to become player-manager of Middlesbrough F.C. in place of Lennie Lawrence. Robson was impressed by the club's ambitions, which included plans for a new 30,000-seat stadium on the banks of the River Tees scheduled for completion in the summer of 1995. Robson brought in former Manchester United teammate Viv Anderson as his assistant.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Huddersfield move into a new home ===\u000aHuddersfield Town relocated from Leeds Road to the new Alfred McAlpine Stadium at Kirklees. Their new home was initially a two-sided 15,000-seat stadium, with plans for an eventual capacity of 25,000. It took its name from the world-famous building company, with which it had a 10-year sponsorship deal.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Bungs scandal hits Tottenham hard ===\u000aAfter the end of the season, Tottenham Hotspur were docked 5 points and were found guilty of financial irregularities dating back to the 1980s and hit with the most severe punishment handed down on any English club: a £600,000 fine, 12 league points deducted for the 1994\u201395 season, and a one-year ban from the F.A Cup. The points deduction and F.A Cup were eventually quashed after a series of appeals, although the fine was increased to £1.5million.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Northampton have a close shave ===\u000aNorthampton Town, who spent one season in the top division during the 1960s, finished bottom of Division Three but retained their league status because Conference champions Kidderminster Harriers were unable to meet the Football League's minimum stadium capacity requirements. This was the first time that there had been no exits or arrivals in the Football League since the re-election system was scrapped in 1987.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Famous debutants ==\u000a15 September 1993: Darren Eadie, 18-year-old winger, makes his debut for Norwich City in their first ever European fixture \u2013 the UEFA Cup first round first leg clash with Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem.\u000a22 September 1993: Robbie Fowler, 18-year-old striker, makes his debut for Liverpool in their 3\u20131 win at Fulham in the Football League Cup second round first leg.\u000a29 September 1993: Stephen Carr, 17-year-old Irish defender, makes his debut for Tottenham Hotspur in a Premier League fixture against Ipswich Town at Portman Road.\u000a3 November 1993: Ade Akinbiyi, 19-year-old London-born striker of Nigerian descent, makes his debut as a substitute for Norwich City in their UEFA Cup second round second leg fixture with Bayern Munich at Carrow Road, which ends in a 1\u20131 draw.\u000a4 May 1994: Michael Duberry, 17-year-old defender, played in Chelsea's final Premier League game of the season \u2013 a 2\u20131 home defeat by Coventry City.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Top goalscorers ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Premier League ===\u000aAndy Cole (Newcastle United) \u2013 34 goals\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Division One ===\u000aJohn McGinlay (Bolton Wanderers) \u2013 25 goals\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Division Two ===\u000aJimmy Quinn (Reading) \u2013 35 goals\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Division Three ===\u000aTony Ellis (Preston North End) \u2013 26 goals\u000a\u000a\u000a== Honours ==\u000aNotes = Number in parentheses is the times that club has won that honour (First Division & Premier League).

Terry Venables is appointed as his replacement.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Qualifying Group Final Positions ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== League tables ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== FA Premiership ===\u000aFor more detail on the Premiership this season see 1993\u201394 FA Premier League\u000aThe second season of the Premier League saw Manchester United retain their title, taking the lead before the end of August and not surrendering it all season, holding a double-digit lead for much of it and eventually finishing eight points ahead of runners-up Blackburn Rovers, who had managed to draw level on points with them a few weeks before the season's end. United then went on to lift the FA Cup and become only the sixth team ever to win the double of the league title and FA Cup. Their top scorer and key player Eric Cantona was voted PFA Players' Player of the Year, while colleagues including Ryan Giggs, Paul Ince and Lee Sharpe also received many plaudits. Blackburn Rovers finished runners-up, thanks to Alan Shearer, whose 31 goals earned him the FWA Footballer of the Year award but weren't quite enough to gain his team the league title.\u000aNewly promoted Newcastle United finished third, largely thanks to the 34 goals of PFA Young Player of the Year Andy Cole who was the division's top scorer and his formidable strike partner Peter Beardsley, as well as support from the likes of Rob Lee and Barry Venison. Fourth placed Arsenal won the European Cup Winners' Cup to claim their sixth trophy in eight seasons under manager George Graham. Leeds United completed the top five, recovering from their dismal Premier League debut the previous season, while unfancied Wimbledon achieved an impressive sixth-place finish.\u000aThe previous season's runners-up, Aston Villa, dropped to 10th place in the league but compensated for this with a League Cup triumph. Norwich, who had finished third the previous campaign, started the season well but their league form slumped after manager Mike Walker left for Everton in January and they finished twelfth, while Walker's new club only narrowly avoided relegation.\u000aSwindon Town, in the top flight for the first time, endured a hopeless season with just five wins in the league, 100 goals conceded and no wins from their opening 16 games. Oldham Athletic's three-year spell in the top flight came to an end after they failed to defeat Norwich on the final day of the season, just weeks after they had almost reached the FA Cup final before a last-gasp equaliser for Manchester United in the semi-final forced a replay, in which they were well beaten. The last relegation place went to Sheffield United, who were relegated in dramatic fashion when they suffered a last minute defeat to FA Cup finalists Chelsea. Their late collapse meant that Ipswich Town were the lucky side to preserve their top flight status.\u000aSource: Barclays Premier League\u000aRules for classification: 1) points; 2) goal difference; 3) number of goals scored1 Arsenal qualified for the Cup Winners' Cup as defending champions.2 Aston Villa qualified for the UEFA Cup as League Cup winners.3Chelsea qualified for the Cup Winners' Cup as FA Cup runners-up.(C) = Champion; (R) = Relegated; (P) = Promoted; (E) = Eliminated; (O) = Play-off winner; (A) = Advances to a further round.\u000aOnly applicable when the season is not finished:(Q) = Qualified to the phase of tournament indicated; (TQ) = Qualified to tournament, but not yet to the particular phase indicated; (RQ) = Qualified to the relegation tournament indicated; (DQ) = Disqualified from tournament.\u000a\u000aLeading goalscorer: Andy Cole (Newcastle United) - 34\u000a\u000a\u000a=== League Division One ===\u000aAlan Smith kicked off his management career by guiding Crystal Palace to the Division One title and regaining their Premiership place at first invitation. Frank Clark began Nottingham Forest's post Brian Clough era by helping them finish second to achieve promotion back to the top flight. They were joined by play-off winners Leicester City, who beat local rivals Derby County in the final which they finally won promotion to the Premiership after two successive play-off final defeats.\u000aNotts County narrowly missed out on the play-offs, as did Wolverhampton Wanderers, who had just replaced Graham Turner as manager after nearly eight years with the former England manager Graham Taylor. Ninth placed Middlesbrough brought in Manchester United and former England captain Bryan Robson as their new player-manager at the end of the season to succeed Lennie Lawrence.\u000aOxford United's decline since losing their top flight status in 1988 continued as they slid into Division Two, along with Peterborough United (who had finished a strong 10th in the previous season, their first in the second tier) and Birmingham City. Newly promoted West Bromwich Albion narrowly avoided relegation at the expense of their local rivals, while Portsmouth's bottom half finish was a major disappointment after they had almost won promotion the previous season, although they did at least have the satisfaction of reaching the quarter-final of the League Cup and taking Manchester United to a replay. Luton Town endured a second successive struggle against relegation, eventually finishing a point above the drop zone, but enjoyed a run to the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in nine years.\u000aLeading goalscorer: John McGinlay (Bolton Wanderers) - 25\u000a\u000a\u000a=== League Division Two ===\u000aMark McGhee won the Division Two championship for Reading after their first successful season in years. They were joined by John Rudge's Port Vale in second place. Burnley triumphed in the Division Two playoffs to secure their second promotion in three seasons, beating a Stockport County side who lost at Wembley for the fourth time in three seasons. Peter Shilton oversaw Plymouth's best season for nearly a decade but they finished three points short of automatic promotion and lost to Burnley in the playoffs.\u000aGoing down to Division Three were Fulham (who would be in the league's lowest tier for the first time in their history), Hartlepool United, Exeter City and Barnet. Blackpool narrowly avoided relegation, but chairman Owen Oyston decided it was time for a change after three-and-a-half seasons under the management of Billy Ayre, and appointed Sam Allardyce as the club's new manager.\u000aLeading goalscorer: Jimmy Quinn (Reading) - 35\u000a\u000a\u000a=== League Division Three ===\u000aShrewsbury Town, Chester City and Crewe Alexandra occupied the three promotion places in Division Three, while Martin O'Neill's Wycombe Wanderers won the playoffs in their first season of league football. The Chairboys beat Preston North End, whose manager John Beck was looking to repeat the same success he had enjoyed at Cambridge. Carlisle and Torquay were the losing semi-finalists, but it was a big step forward for two sides who had narrowly avoided relegation to the Conference a year earlier.\u000aNorthampton Town finished bottom of the league but were saved from demotion because Conference champions Kidderminster Harriers did not meet the league's stadium capacity requirements.\u000aWigan Athletic's first season at this level for over a decade brought their lowest ever finish of 19th place (89th out of the league's 92 clubs).\u000aLeading goalscorer: Tony Ellis (Preston North End) - 26\u000a\u000a\u000a== Transfer deals ==\u000aFor subsequent transfer deals see 1994\u201395 in English football.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Successful players ==\u000aEric Cantona received the PFA Players' Player of the Year award after his 25 goals in all competitions were the key force in Manchester United's double glory.\u000aAlan Shearer was voted FWA Footballer of the Year after returning from injury to score 31 Premier League goals for runners-up Blackburn Rovers.\u000aAndy Cole was voted PFA Young Player of the Year after finishing top scorer in the Premier League with 34 goals for newly promoted Newcastle United, who finished third and qualified for Europe for the first time since the 1970s.\u000aCole's veteran partner Peter Beardsley scored 24 goals in all competitions in his first season back on Tyneside.\u000aDean Saunders was again a consistent goalscorer for Aston Villa, who dipped to 10th in the league a year after finishing runners-up, but booked themselves another UEFA Cup campaign thanks to glory in the League Cup.\u000a21-year-old striker Chris Sutton attracted huge attention from England's top clubs before his record-breaking transfer from Norwich City to Blackburn Rovers.\u000aStan Collymore established himself as one of the country's top marksmen as he powered Nottingham Forest back into the Premier League at the first attempt.\u000aVeteran Reading striker Jimmy Quinn scored 35 league goals to lead his side to the Division Two title.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Successful managers ==\u000aCrystal Palace and Nottingham Forest gained promotion to the Premiership in their first season under the respective management of Alan Smith and Frank Clark.\u000aBrian Little finally got it right with Leicester City as he helped them win promotion to the Premiership.\u000aJimmy Mullen inspired Burnley's second promotion in two seasons as they won the Division Two playoffs.\u000aMartin O'Neill helped Wycombe Wanderers gain their second successive promotion and earn a place in Division Two.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Retirements ==\u000a21 January 1994: Mel Sterland, 32-year-old Leeds United defender, retires after failing to overcome an achilles injury suffered more than a year ago.\u000a2 May 1994: Frank Stapleton, 38-year-old former Arsenal and Manchester United striker, retires from playing after being dismissed as player-manager by Division Two club Bradford City.\u000a9 May 1994: Paul Elliott, 30-year-old Chelsea central defender, retires from playing 20 months after suffering a serious knee injury for which he is about to begin a legal challenge against Dean Saunders, the former Liverpool striker who collided with him when he was injured.\u000a31 May 1994: Kevin Moran, 38-year-old Blackburn Rovers central defender, announces his retirement as a player but will not retire completely until the end of the Republic of Ireland's World Cup campaign.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Diary of the season ==\u000a1 July 1993 \u2013 Barnsley appoint Sheffield Wednesday defender Viv Anderson as their player-manager to succeed Mel Machin.\u000a5 July 1993 \u2013 Gordon Cowans begins his third spell at Aston Villa after joining them on a free transfer from Blackburn Rovers, while Nottingham Forest pay £2million for 22-year-old Southend United striker Stan Collymore.\u000a14 July 1993 \u2013 After Lee Chapman departs to Portsmouth on a free transfer, Leeds United replace him with record signing Brian Deane from Sheffield United for £2.9million, while England midfielder David Platt is transferred for the third year running when he leaves Juventus in a £5.2million move to Italian Serie A rivals Sampdoria.\u000a15 July 1993 \u2013 Huddersfield Town manager Ian Ross pays the price for the club's horrid form in the first half of the previous season by being sacked.

Chelsea were surprised to be held 0-0 at Stamford Bridge by Barnet, despite it being Barnet's 'home' tie. Barnet had been struggling at the bottom of the third tier for the entire season, having seen most of their squad and manager leave for Southend United, who they ironically knocked out of the season's League Cup.

In Division One, Crystal Palace and Charlton Athletic lead the race for promotion to the Premier League. The playoff zone is occupied by Millwall, Leicester City, Tranmere Rovers and Nottingham Forest. Wolverhampton Wanderers are on the comeback trail after a run of dismal form before Christmas, and are now just two points and two places outside the playoff zone.\u000a2 February 1994 \u2013 Newcastle United pay a club record £2.5million for Norwich City winger Ruel Fox.\u000a5 February 1994 \u2013 Having scored only one league goal all season before now, Norwegian striker Jan Age Fjortoft scores a hat-trick for Swindon Town (still bottom of the Premier League) in their 3\u20131 home win over Coventry City.\u000a9 February 1994 \u2013 The FA Cup fourth round replays witness some of the most surprising results ever seen in the competition.

Arsenal, Newcastle United and Liverpool complete an unchanged top five at this month end. At the other end of the table, Oldham Athletic and Swindon Town prop up the rest of the Premier League while Manchester City have climbed out of the bottom three at the expense of Sheffield United. Crystal Palace remain top of Division One, with Charlton Athletic second in the table.

He is succeeded at Goodison Park by Arsenal's Anders Limpar for £1.6million. Tottenham Hotspur's quest to sign a new striker in an attempt to stave off relegation ends in failure when West Ham's Clive Allen signs for Division One promotion chasers Millwall for £75,000, ending talk his return to Tottenham, who also fail to lure Frenchman Jean-Pierre Papin from Bayern Munich. Steve Morrow is reportedly set for a new Arsenal contract after a proposed move to a Swindon Town side heading for relegation is called off. Another player going nowhere is QPR striker Les Ferdinand, who has been subject to transfer speculation for months. Joining Anders Limpar at Goodison Park is 20-year-old AFC Bournemouth midfielder Joe Parkinson, a hot prospect costing £250,000. Leicester City boost their promotion challenge with a £360,000 move for Portsmouth midfielder Mark Blake. Wimbledon sign Brentford striker Marcus Gayle for £250,000.

Andrew Cole becomes the first player to reach the 30-goal mark in the Premier League when he scores in Newcastle's 3\u20130 home win over Norwich City.\u000a31 March 1994 \u2013 Manchester United's treble bid may be over, but they finish March as Premier League leaders by a six-point margin over second-placed Blackburn Rovers. They are also in the FA Cup semi-finals. Newcastle United, Arsenal and Leeds United complete the top five. Oldham Athletic, who will soon be competing in the FA Cup semi-final with Manchester United, are starting to look set for Premier League survival as they have climbed out of the relegation zone at the expense of Southampton, while Sheffield United and Swindon Town remain there. In Division One, Crystal Palace continue to head the table and have been joined in the automatic promotion places by a Nottingham Forest side who weren't even in the playoff zone a month ago. Leicester City, Millwall, Derby County and Tranmere Rovers occupy the playoff zone.\u000a2 April 1994 \u2013 Blackburn Rovers draw level on points with leaders Manchester United after beating them 2\u20130 at Ewood Park, three months after United had established a 16-point lead. Alan Shearer scores both of Blackburn's goals.

In the league, the drama of the day comes as Southampton boost their survival bid with a dramatic 5\u20134 win over Norwich City at Carrow Road. Matt Le Tissier scores a hat-trick for the Saints, while Chris Sutton scores twice for the Canaries. Everton, meanwhile, give their own survival bid a boost with a 1\u20130 away win over West Ham United, with Tony Cottee scoring against his old club.\u000a10 April 1994 \u2013 A late equaliser by Mark Hughes forces a replay for Manchester United as they draw 1\u20131 with Oldham Athletic in the FA Cup semi-final, on the same day that Eric Cantona (suspended for today's game) is voted PFA Player of the Year \u2013 the first foreign player to receive this accolade.\u000a11 April 1994 \u2013 Alan Shearer scores his 30th league goal of the season in Blackburn's 1\u20130 home league win over Aston Villa.\u000a13 April 1994 \u2013 Manchester United beat Oldham Athletic 4\u20131 in the FA Cup semi-final replay at Maine Road.\u000a20 April 1994 \u2013 The Football League confirms that no team will be relegated to the Football Conference this year, as none of the teams in the top half of the Conference (which, curiously, includes former League members Southport) have a ground which meets the criteria for admission to the League. This leaves Northampton Town and Darlington, who are both well adrift at the bottom of Division Three, fighting only the dishonour of placing as the League's bottom club.\u000a23 April 1994 \u2013 Eric Cantona returns from his five-match ban in style by scoring both of Manchester United's goals in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford, which United win 2\u20130.\u000a26 April 1994 \u2013 A Dean Holdsworth hat-trick gives Wimbledon a 3\u20130 home league win over Oldham Athletic, who fall further into relegation trouble.\u000a30 April 1994 \u2013 April draws to a close with Manchester United still top of the league, though leading by just two points with a game in hand over Blackburn Rovers, the only team who now stand a mathematical chance of catching them. Newcastle United, Arsenal and Leeds United complete the top five, which a resurgent Wimbledon would now be in had it not been for their weaker form earlier on in the season. Swindon Town, meanwhile, have had their relegation confirmed as they occupy bottom place with a mere 27 points and just four wins so far this season. Oldham Athletic and Sheffield United complete the bottom three, while Southampton, Everton, Ipswich Town, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City are still under threat of relegation. Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest will be playing Premier League football next season after sealing promotion from Division One, a year after relegation. The playoff zone is occupied by Tranmere Rovers, Leicester City, Derby County and Millwall, but there is still a chance of Notts County or Wolverhampton Wanderers ousting Millwall from the playoff places. The last game is played in front of Liverpool's Spion Kop before it is rebuilt as an all-seater stand.\u000a1 May 1994 \u2013 Manchester United complete a back-to-back FA Premier League title triumph after their nearest rivals Blackburn Rovers lost 2\u20131 to Coventry City in their penultimate game of the season.

Sheffield United only needed a point to stay up at the expense of Ipswich Town, but a last-minute goal from Mark Stein gave Chelsea a 3\u20132 win. Andrew Cole completes the season with 34 league goals (41 in all competitions) for Newcastle United.\u000a14 May 1994 \u2013 Manchester United complete the 'double' by beating Chelsea 4\u20130 in the 1994 FA Cup Final.\u000a20 May 1994 \u2013 QPR give a free transfer to 37-year-old midfielder Ray Wilkins, the veteran midfielder who played 84 times for England between 1978 and 1986.\u000a24 May 1994 \u2013 Matt Le Tissier, who has been linked with a move to several big clubs including Manchester United, signs a new contract to stay at Southampton until at least 1997.\u000a26 May 1994 \u2013 Ray Wilkins, 38, leaves QPR to become player-coach of newly promoted Crystal Palace.\u000a10 June 1994 \u2013 Bobby Charlton, record goalscorer for both Manchester United and England, receives a knighthood.\u000a14 June 1994 \u2013 Tottenham Hotspur are found guilty of financial irregularities and receive the heaviest punishment ever imposed on an English club.

Busby replaced the ageing members of this teams with exciting young players who were known as the 'Busby Babes'. They won two straight league titles before eight players died and two had their careers ended by the Munich Air Disaster in 1958. Busby himself was gravely injured but made a full recovery against all the odds. He then built a third great team for the 1960s which won an F.A Cup and two league titles before reaching its pinnacle with the European Cup in 1968.

aVThe Windmill Point Light was a lighthouse located at the mouth of the Rappahannock River.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThis light was erected in 1869 to replace the last of three lightships stationed at this location to mark the end of the Rappahannock Spit, a shoal extending east from Windmill Point itself. These lightships were stationed beginning in 1839, the first being seized by the Confederates in the Civil War. As was typical of such an exposed location, ice was a serious threat, and the light was badly damaged in the winter of 1917\u20131918, with repairs not completed until 1921.\u000aAutomation came in 1954, and the house was removed in favor of a skeleton tower in 1965. As with the nearby Stingray Point Light, a private party, one Dr William Atwood, purchased portions of the house in hopes of reassembling it on shore. As with the other light, however, Dr Atwood was unable to complete his plan. The tower and original foundation remain in service.\u000aAs of the 2007\u20132008 winter, the old girder works of the original lighthouse were removed and replaced by a single concrete-filled caisson with superstructure tower and light and placards. Note the rip rap of the original light surrounds the new structure, which is right at sea level and sometimes not visible. The lighthouse should not be approached within a 100-foot radius; on Sunday 25 May 2008 a sailboat went aground on these rocks and required USCG and Sea Tow assistance to be towed off.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a"Historic Light Station Information and Photography: Virginia".

aVBeth Raines is a fictional character from the long-running American soap opera, Guiding Light. Judi Evans debuted in the role in May 1983 and remained with the show until July 1986. After Lisa Loughridge stepped in as a temporary replacement, Beth Chamberlin assumed the role from October 2, 1989 to February 18, 1991, and November 1, 1997 to September 18, 2009. Beth is the stepdaughter of the late Bradley Raines and daughter of Lillian Raines. She is the mother of Lizzie, James, and Peyton Spaulding and is known for her tumultuous relationship with her husband Phillip Spaulding. Evans won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 1984 for her portrayal of the character. In 2010, Beth Chamberlin secured a nomination in the same category.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Background ==\u000aThe character of Beth Raines has been half of two supercouples: Beth and Lujack Luvonaczek (Vincent Irizarry) and Beth and Philip Spaulding (Grant Aleksander). Beth has also been married to Philip's father, Alan Spaulding (Ron Raines) and Philip's best friend Rick Bauer (Michael O'Leary). Beth, Philip, Rick and Mindy Lewis (Krista Tesreau) called themselves "The Four Musketeers" in the 1980s. Together they were four best friends with a watertight bond.\u000aPlaying Beth Raines was the first television/daytime role for now veteran actress Judi Evans. She stated that three of the four actors who played the four musketeers were all hired around the same time and that the four of them were very close. She also said that her time on Guiding Light was magical. It was when she realized that she was finally living her dream.\u000a\u000a\u000a== The book behind the character ==\u000aChamberlin is the author of the novel, Lorelei's Guiding Light: An Intimate Diary, written under the pen name of and the Beth Raines' alias Lorelei Hills. Published by St. Martin's Press, it was released during the summer of 2002. The Cincinnati Enquirer listed the book as number one on their best seller list for July 2, 2002. In the storyline, the book was Beth's diary while she suffered from amnesia and believed her name was Lorelei.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Storylines ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1983\u201386 ===\u000aFrom the start, the character of Beth Raines was a recognized fan favorite. Soap Opera Digest named her 1984's Most Beleaguered Heroine, called her a part of "one of the top triangles ever to grace daytime" and compared later storylines to General Hospital's romantic/adventure couple Luke and Laura.\u000aBeth Raines first appeared on Guiding Light in the spring of 1983. Beth was acknowledged to have been born March 16, 1966. Her biological father was killed in Vietnam. Her mother, Lillian, a nurse, had remarried Bradley Raines. In 1983, a 17-year-old Beth was admitted to Cedars Hospital as an unconscious victim of an abusive stepfather. Her roommate was Mindy Lewis. Mindy was friends with two orderlies, Phillip Spaulding and Rick Bauer. The four of them formed a fast friendship, nicknamed "The Four Musketeers" which quickly developed into a romantic quadrangle. Beth was a shy, artistic teenager. Philip and Mindy, both heirs to two of Springfield's premier families, were dating when Philip fell for Beth who was dating Rick. Fate seemed to be pushing Philip and Beth together when they were named king and queen at their high school prom. When a traumatized Beth became nearly catatonic after being raped by her stepfather, the two of them ran away to New York City. The storyline took place at Christmas time and introduced the character of Nick, a Santa-like figure who would make later appearances on the show throughout the years around the holiday season. The location shoot was plagued by bad weather and a need for many reshoots. However, the result was a charming memorable love story that Grant Aleksander (Philip) said was worth the extra effort. They returned to be married, but discovered that Mindy, Beth's maid of honor, was pregnant with Philip's child, and Philip married Mindy instead.\u000aBeth moved on with a gangleader named Brandon Luvoneczek, who called himself Lujack to conceal his identity for his criminal activities in a star-crossed romance. It was discovered he was the long-lost son of Philip's aunt Alexandra Spaulding. Lujack's ex-girlfriend also held Beth, LuJack and his mother hostage. Meanwhile, Mindy miscarried and after Philip and Mindy divorced, Philip tried to win Beth back. Beth was temporarily blinded in an explosion, when a jealous Philip hired someone to blow up a bar that Lujack was building with one of his past theft victims, Floyd Parker (Tom Nielsen). Lujack was accused of the murder of Andy Ferris (whom Philip had paid to blow up Lujack's bar), and the couple became amateur detectives to clear his name. Lujack was killed, leaving a heartbroken Beth to eventually reunite with Philip briefly before being kidnapped and presumed dead in 1986.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1989\u20131991 ===\u000aIn 1989, paintings of Beth surface and Philip becomes convinced that she is still alive. Meanwhile, Beth has returned to Springfield with Neil Everest, but with amnesia and unable to speak. A run-in with Bradley leads to her recovering her memory and eventually making amends with her stepfather. That December, Philip and Beth are reunited at the Willow Hills Sanitarium, where Philip stops Beth's marriage to Neil and Beth regains her speech. In 1990, Neil helps Beth recall what really happened when she was believed to be dead. She reveals that she killed her abductor, Professor Blackburn, when he tried to attack her. She sleeps with Philip who is at this time married to Blake, who refuses to grant him a divorce. When she finds out she's pregnant, she's unsure of the baby's paternity. She thinks it is Neil but later finds out that it's Philip. Neil is killed in an explosion that Philip is accused of causing. Philip, with the help of Rick and Beth, fakes his death to escape jail time. Beth and Rick marry to throw off suspicion related to Philip's fake death. Philip returns in October, and Beth gives birth to a daughter, Elizabeth Spualding (Lizzie), in November. In December, Beth and Rick divorce. Rick becomes Lizzie's godfather. The following year (1991) Philip and Beth marry and moved to Arizona with Lizzie.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1997-2001 ===\u000aIn 1996, Philip and Beth were divorced off-screen.\u000aIn 1997, Beth returns to Springfield with Lizzie (played by Hayden Panettiere). Philip is dating Harley Cooper. Beth begins to date Ben Warren and announces to Philip that she intends to stay in town. In 1998, she teams up with Annie Dutton to try to win Philip back from Harley. She is named as a suspect in the murder of Carl Stevens. It is later revealed that young Lizzie shot and killed Carl because he had abused her mother. She protects Lizzie and unhappily allows her to be in Philip and Harley's wedding. In 1998, Beth makes a play for Matt Reardon, but later dates Jim Lemay (legally father to Harley's daughter Susan, who she gave up for adoption as a teen mom). When Beth, Philip and Jim are in a plane crash, Jim escapes to find help. Beth and Philip, thinking they are about to die make love. After being rescued, Beth accepts Jim Lemay's proposal. In 2000, Beth found out that she was pregnant with Philip's baby. She convinced Philip to allow her to pass the baby off as Jim's, in order to preserve both of their marriages. However, that same year, Lizzie is diagnosed with leukemia. Jim refuses to allow the doctors to induce labor in order to use the stem cells from the cord blood to save Lizzie's life. After breaking up and then reconciling, Jim saves Lizzie and baby James from a fire but died shortly afterward.\u000aIn 2001, Beth allows herself to be seduced by Prince Edmond Winslow of San Christobel and conspires with him to overthrow his brother, Prince Richard Winslow. She became a princess but divorced Edmond when she found out that he was holding Cassie prisoner. When she found out about it Edmund kept her in the same place he had been holding Cassie. She escaped and was saved by her ex Phillip. In 2001, Beth is presumed dead again when she is caught up in a flash flood in San Christobel.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2002-2009 ===\u000aEdmund later meets a country girl named Lorelei Hills who looks exactly like Beth. He convinces her to come to Springfield and scam the Spauldings out of Beth's fortune by convincing them that Beth wasn't really dead. The con is successful and Philip began to fall in love with "Beth." When he realizes that she is an impostor, Lorelei and Edmond are jailed. In jail, Lorelei has flashback's of Beth's life and it is revealed that she really is Beth, only she that had amnesia all this time. Her fingerprints match and it is confirmed that she is the real Beth. Lorelei/Beth now struggles with her split personality. Lorelei dominates temporarily and runs off with Edmund. Eventually Beth's personality wins out and she is reunited with Philip and Lizzie. Just as they start to get back on track, a lover from Lorelei's past comes to Springfield in the unlikely person of Bill Lewis, the son of Billy Lewis and Vanessa Chamberlin Reardon, who was last seen as a teenager and is now a young college student.\u000aIn 2004, Philip was presumed dead, after having been shot by his father, Alan. In 2006 Beth was shocked to learn that Rick not only helped him fake his death, but had kept that information from her and everyone in Springfield. Beth married Philip's father Alan to obtain security for herself and her children. When she miscarried their baby, he became obsessed with a Lizzie's pregnancy and trying to gain custody of the child, fathered by Jonathan Randall, son of Alan's one-time wife, Reva Shayne. Beth divorced Alan Spaulding, but despite his short-lived marriage to Doris Wolf, and his near death at the hands of her daughter Ashley, Beth and Alan continued to bounce back and forth in their relationship. At one point, during the investigation to find out who shot Alan, Beth attempted to seduce Alan's other son, Alan-Michael, but was unsuccessful.\u000aBeth focused on protecting Lizzie and her baby from Alan and reconnected with Rick, who was at the time married to Mel Boudreaux and father to their daughter Leah. Beth, Rick and Alan formed an on-again/off-again triangle. The affair was revealed by Jonathan Randall in an angry outburst. Rick and Mel divorced and Beth became pregnant, but paternity was uncertain. A distraught Cassie tampered with the paternity test to show that Rick was the father of Beth's baby, and Beth was married to Rick on the Fourth of July by Josh Lewis, who had become a preacher. Cassie blamed Alan for the death of her daughter Tammy, and wanted ostensibly to "protect Beth's child from having Alan Spaulding as a father." Lizzie was dismayed and angry that she hadn't been invited and was one of the last people to find out. Thinking the baby was a Bauer, Beth named the baby Bernadette as a tribute to Bert Bauer, Rick's grandmother. At Bernadette's baptism, Reva blurted out the truth in order to save her own son from Alan's wrath. Beth decided instead after some additional thought to rename her daughter Peyton Alexandra Raines instead of Bernadette Bauer.\u000aBeth decided to go to law school, but her personal life remained more murky. When Alan had a brain tumor and started having visions of his dead son Gus, Beth started a relationship with Henry Cooper "Coop" Bradshaw who had been previously engaged to her daughter Lizzie. The relationship was supposed to be kept secret so Alan wouldn't find out but eventually everyone knew except Alan. When Alan found out he threatened to take Peyton from Beth and kill Coop if she didn't marry him. On the way to stop the wedding Coop got into a car accident. Phillip, who had been presumed dead for nearly five years, had recently decided to return to Springfield, and found Coop after the accident. He took him to the hospital, then went to the church to tell everyone what had happened. Beth was shocked to see Phillip alive, and then jolted to learn that Coop was clinging to life. Beth visited Coop on his deathbed, and his sacrifice made her decide not to marry Alan. During the relationship of Beth and Coop he wrote a book about their love and it was eventually published. Phillip's return jolted the entire Spaulding family, and they barely had time to adjust when Beth's and Phillip's 19-year-old son, James, returned from boarding school. James was running a Ponzi scheme and even when Phillip helped clear the charges against him, he resented Phillip's return. Beth was torn between the love of her life and the son who had only known the worst of his father. During this time Beth also helped her daughter Lizzie marry Bill Lewis.\u000aEventually, Phillip learned he was dying. He didn't tell anyone, aside from Lillian (who was a nurse), and tried to repair the relationships in his life with the time he had left. Beth found out in what were supposed to be Phillip's last days, and she felt devastated as well as betrayed by Phillip and by her mother. Fortunately for Phillip, Alan agreed to a bone marrow transplant, and saved his son's life, but a few days later, Alan quietly died after attending the double wedding of Lillian and Buzz Cooper and Vanessa Chamberlain and Billy Lewis. Beth was forced to break the news to her young daughter Peyton. Shortly before Alan's death, Phillip had proposed to Beth, and she had happily accepted. James and Phillip were now reconciled and Lizzie was trying for a baby. Beth also decided to return to her first love, drawing. A year later, Beth and Phillip were happily remarried, and were celebrating the upcoming nuptials of their best friends Rick and Mindy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000ahttps://web.archive.org/web/20061116192253/http://www.soap-news.com/gl/c/bethraines.htm\u000ahttp://www.soapcentral.com/gl/whoswho/beth.php\u000ahttp://www.angelfire.com/tv2/jelonline/beth.html\u000ahttps://web.archive.org/web/20100403040632/http://www.sonypictures.com/gl/cast/ch_raines_beth.jhtml\u000ahttp://www.angelfire.com/tv2/jelonline/press/84spw_rockyroad.html\u000ahttps://web.archive.org/web/20080407102532/http://www.soapoperadigest.com/features/gl/pandt/bethtimeline/

aVThe Holohan murder case concerns the death of OSS Major William Holohan in Italy during the Second World War.\u000aIn September 1944, the U.S. Army's Office of Strategic Services (OSS) dispatched teams of specially trained soldiers into enemy-occupied territory to organize resistance movements. In Europe, one team was dispatched to the Como, Italy area. Its mission was code-named "Chrysler". Many of the partisan groups in Europe and Asia were overtly communist. This greatly concerned some Allied planners, since the communists could be expected to use their military power to take control of post-war government. The uprising in Paris in August 1944 was fomented by pro-communist police who were then pushed aside by forces loyal to Charles de Gaulle. In Greece, a civil war erupted between communist and anti-communist partisan forces.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Mission Chrysler ==\u000aOn September 27, 1944, four American soldiers \u2013 mission commander Major William V. Holohan, First Lieutenant Giannino, Second Lieutenant Aldo Icardi, and radio operator Carl G. LoDolce \u2013 and three Italian agents parachuted into northern Italy near Coiromonte, a frazione of Armeno in the province of Novara. Holohan was a forty-year-old lawyer who had a peacetime reserve commission in the cavalry. Twenty-two-year-old Lieutenant Icardi was the only mission member able to speak the dialect of the region. Lieutenant Giannino spoke Italian and LoDolce spoke Sicilian. Holohan was entrusted with about $16,000 worth of U.S. dollars, gold Louis d'ors, Swiss francs, and Italian lire to fund mission activities. Holohan insisted that his men wear their uniforms in accordance with OSS directives to protect against being executed as spies if captured.\u000aThe situation in northern Italy, 600 miles (1,000 km) from the Allied armies, was particularly complex. There were four major anti-fascist groups: the Socialists, Action Party, Christian Democrat, and Communist, plus smaller groups under commanders with imprecise allegiances. Originally, Mission Chrysler was to establish a show of authority and liaison in the area in anticipation of an early Axis capitulation. When this did not happen, the mission was changed to assist the partisan units with arms and supplies.\u000aGerman forces went after the Chrysler men, who had several narrow escapes from anti-partisan sweeps. At one point, the Germans pinpointed the OSS transmitter to within 100 yards, but partisans intercepted three Germans and a Swiss interpreter with direction-finding gear. In December, an independent partisan leader called Cinquanta betrayed the Chrysler men to the Germans. Cinquanta was later assassinated.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Communists ==\u000aOn December 2, 1944, Holohan sent Icardi to meet with the local communist commander, Vincenzo Moscatelli. This was reluctantly arranged by Aminta Migliari, aka Giorgio, who had wanted the arms drops funneled through him. Although Migliari proved to be treacherous, the OSS men had to rely on him for support. The communists, who made up about 75% of the partisans in the Chrysler area, were supposed to receive equal allocations of the two arms drops, but they frequently raided drops intended for rival groups. Lieutenant Icardi stated in 1950 that Holohan treated the communists equally as the other groups. Some Italians regarded Holohan as "fervently anti-Communist".\u000aOn December 6, 1944, the OSS men were holed up in Villa Castelnuovo on Lake Orta when two friendly priests came to warn them to flee. As the soldiers left in the darkness, gunfire broke out and Holohan, Icardi, LoDolce and Italian agents Gualtiero and Tozzini fired back. By prearrangement, the men would split up if attacked. Icardi made it to Giorgio's headquarters. When the men finally reunited, Holohan was missing. Icardi reported the incident to his headquarters.\u000aTwo weeks later, an OSS man from Milan visited the Lake Orta and investigated Holohan's disappearance. At the villa, the officer found spent 9mm shell casings (used by all sides) and on the beach, one of Holohan's hand grenades.\u000aThe surviving Chrysler men continued to arrange supply drops to the partisans, and Moscatelli stated later that after Holohan\u2019s death, OSS support increased. In February 1945, Mission Chrysler was ordered to Milan, but its operations changed because of the urban environment, which precluded air drops and hiding in the countryside.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Questions ==\u000aAfter the war, Holohan's brother, Joseph R. Holahan (his spelling), a stockbroker, sought to learn more about the night at Villa Castelnuovo. He wrote to the Defense Department and the Italian police, and he interviewed Icardi, by then a lawyer in Pittsburgh. In 1947, after the OSS men returned to civilian life, Icardi was interviewed by Army investigators and given a polygraph examination. Icardi offered to reenter the Army in order to submit to a court-martial and clear up any questions.\u000aIn January 1949, Italian Carabiniere Lieutenant Elio Albieri became interested in the case. When he questioned ex-partisans Tozzini and Mannini in March 1950, they told a story of Icardi becoming resentful of Holohan's refusal to support the communists and hatching a plot to murder the major. When an attempt to poison Holohan's soup failed, a toss of a coin selected LoDolce to go to Holohan's room, where LoDolce shot him twice in the head. The Italians stuffed Holohan's body into a sleeping bag and then dumped it into the lake. The men assisted the Italian police in recovering the body, which was identified as Holohan's. The skull showed two bullet wounds.\u000aOn August 3, 1950, former Sergeant Carl G. LoDolce gave a statement to Army CID (Criminal Investigative Division) in Rochester, New York. LoDolce alleged that he and former Lieutenant Aldo Icardi, both members of Holohan's team, had killed Holohan in a dispute over providing aid to communist partisans. The members of the mission had drawn lots to see who would kill Holohan.\u000aAnother former OSS sergeant who served on Chrysler, Arthur P. Ciaramicoli, declared the allegations "silly." As for feelings towards Holohan, Ciaramicoli told a reporter, "We all didn't particularly like the major. He was older than the rest of us and was content to sit back and take things easy. He endangered our lives on several occasions by his attitude".\u000aIcardi denied involvement in Holoran's death, and LoDolce repudiated the press accounts of his involvement in murder taken by the CID investigator. Former partisan leader Vincenzo Moscatelli, by now a senator in the Italian Parliament, told reporters that Holohan had an "anti-Communist attitude" and described Icardi as a "valiant soldier who helped greatly in the partisan struggle against the Germans." True magazine Rome correspondent Michael Stern published an article based on the Italian case, and Time magazine also adopted the Italian version in its coverage. The New York Times published a lengthy statement by Icardi given to the Pittsburgh Press.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Trial in absentia ==\u000aIn the fall of 1951, the Italian government charged Icardi and LoDolce with murder and tried to have them extradited to Italy, but U.S. judges denied the extradition requests. Icardi and LoDolce were outside the jurisdiction of U.S. military authorities because they had been discharged, and U.S. courts had no jurisdiction over offenses committed in Italy. The judge in Icardi\u2019s case refused the request to extradite him because at the time of the alleged crime, the Italian government did not have control over the area of the offense. In their rulings, however, the judges accepted the Italian version of events.\u000aIn 1953, the two Americans were tried for murder in absentia in Novara, Italy, along with former partisans "Giorgio" Migliari, Giuseppa Mannini, and Gualtieri Tozzini. The Italians testified to having helped plan murder of Holohan, who was poisoned and shot by LoDolce on Icardi's orders in order to divert more arms to the communists and to acquire between $45,000 and $150,000 (far more than the actual funds involved) that Holohan had for covert operations. They said that Holohan was "sentenced to death" as a "traitor".\u000aMigliari testified that he and Icardi each invested $75,000 in Italian lire in a toy factory, the money coming from commissions paid by Holohan to get favorable exchange rates on the mission's funds. Some witnesses accused Icardi of living a lavish lifestyle and that Icardi had murdered Holohan on the orders of superiors, while others complimented Icardi's honesty and courage. When Senator Moscatelli was asked if Icardi was a communist, the former partisan leader said, \u201cHow could he be if he is still a member of the United States Intelligence Service?\u201d \u000aAlthough Icardi and LoDolce were absent, they had a lawyer who told the court that Major Holohan had to be eliminated "as an obstacle in the fight for victory."\u000aThe Italians (who spent three years in jail) were acquitted by the judges who felt that the partisans acted "out of necessity" and were following orders. The Americans were convicted in absentia of murder. Icardi was sentenced to life imprisonment and LoDolce was sentenced to 17 years. Since neither man could be forced to go to Italy, neither served time.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Committee investigation ==\u000aThe U.S. Congress then entered the story after Joseph Holahan joined the staff of the House Armed Services Committee. On March 26, 1953, a two-man subcommittee, including Chairman W. Sterling Cole, traveled to Pittsburgh and interviewed Icardi, who denied the murder charges. On August 29, 1955, Icardi was indicted by a federal grand jury for eight counts of perjury.\u000aThe trial began on April 17, 1956. The prosecution had 18 Italian witnesses ready. Icardi's defense attorney, Edward Bennett Williams, argued that Holohan was killed on the orders of communist partisan leader Moscatelli because of Holohan's opposition to the communists. The attack that killed Holohan was actually staged by Moscatelli\u2019s men. Williams got Congressman Cole to admit that he had discussed getting a perjury charge against Icardi before the interview. After Cole stepped down from the witness stand, Williams moved that the case be dismissed because there was no valid legislative purpose in the interrogations of Icardi.\u000aOn April 19, 1956, Judge Richmond B. Keech handed down a directed verdict of acquittal on the perjury charges, citing the defense argument that there was no valid legislative purpose to Icardi's testimony before the subcommittee and the perjury charge could not stand. Keech had strong words for Congressman Cole's conduct. Icardi wept.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Confession ==\u000aWilliams later went to Italy with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent and met with Senator Moscatelli. Moscatelli was still in the Italian Parliament representing the Italian Communist Party. Moscatelli admitted that he was responsible for Holohan's death and Icardi had nothing to do with it.\u000aAldo Icardi practiced law in Florida until his retirement.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000aIcardi, Aldo; American Master Spy, University Books, New York, 1956\u000aRoosevelt, Kermit; War Report of the OSS, Volume 2, The Overseas Targets, Walker and Company, New York, 1976\u000aUnited States.

aVThe tautirut (Inuktitut syllabics: \u1455\u1405\u144e\u1548\u1466 or tautiruut, also known as the Eskimo fiddle) is a bowed zither native to the Inuit culture of Canada.\u000aLucien M. Turner described the "Eskimo violin" in 1894 as being\u000a\u000a...made of birch or spruce, and the two strings are of coarse, loosely twisted sinew. The bow has a strip of whalebone in place of horsehair, and is resined with spruce gum. This fiddle is held across the lap when played.\u000a\u000aThe Canadian anthropologist Ernest William Hawkes described the tautirut in 1916:\u000a\u000aIt consists of a rude box, with a square hole in the top, three sinew strings with bridge and tail-piece and a short bow with a whalebone strip for hair. . . . Most Eskimo fiddles have only one string.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Origin ==\u000aThe tautirut, along with the Apache fiddle are among the few First Nations chordophones which may possibly be pre-Columbian in origin. Ethnomusicologist Anthony Baines and others have noted the similarity of the tautirut to the Icelandic fiðla and Shetland gue.\u000aPeter Cooke believed that the tautirut's limited distribution around the Hudson Bay area indicated that it was introduced to the Inuit by Hudson's Bay Company sailors from the Orkney and Shetland Islands.\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aTautirut in the collection of the Faculté de musique, Université de Montréal\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aHawe's Eskimo Music, in: Scientific American: Supplement, Munn and Co., 1917, p. 187f.\u000aE.

aVA couloir (French: [ku.lwa\u0281], "passage" or "corridor"), is a narrow gully with a steep gradient in a mountainous terrain.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geology ==\u000aA couloir may be a seam, scar, or fissure, or vertical crevasse in an otherwise solid mountain mass. Though often hemmed in by sheer cliff walls, couloirs may also be less well-defined, and often simply a line of broken talus or scree ascending the mountainside and bordered by trees or other natural features. Couloirs are especially significant in winter months when they may be filled in with snow or ice, and become much more noticeable than in warmer months when most of the snow and ice may recede. These physical features make the use of couloirs popular for both mountaineering and skiing.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Mountaineering ==\u000aA famous couloir is the Grand Couloir on Mount Everest.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Skiing ==\u000aWhile in the United States such terrain features are uncommon at ski resorts, in Europe they are more common. Couloirs are frequently considered an off-piste trail and, as such, are not marked on ski piste maps.

aVNot to be confused with Beach Haven, New Jersey.\u000aBeach Haven West is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within Stafford Township, in Ocean County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the CDP's population was 3,896.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe site that Beach Haven West is located on was known as Remson Meadows along the Manahawkin Bayfront. In 1950, the salt marshes were bought by the Shapiro brothers, Herbert and Jerome, who developed vacation homes throughout the Jersey Shore. Using a dredge towed up from North Carolina, construction began on Beach Haven West's 130-plus saltwater lagoons and 5,000 single-family homes.\u000aBeach Haven West was built in phases, the first opening in 1957. The first phase contained the lagoons and cul-de-sacs branching between Morris Boulevard and Jennifer Lane. By the early 1960s, the second phase was completed, this one spanning between Jonathan Drive and Walter Boulevard. Afterwords, the third phase was completed, which contained the development along Mill Creek Road between Route 72 and Jonathan Drive, as well as the Charles Boulevard spur. By the 1970s, the lagoon-front community was expanded down Mill Creek Road towards East Point.\u000aThe Shapiros later sold their remaining properties to Lincoln Properties, LLC, another shore development firm. They completed the Mill Creek Road section along Mill Creek down to Barnegat Bay at East Point, added the southern lagoons along Newell Avenue known as Village Harbour, and developed the Colony Lakes section by 1986.\u000aThrough satellite imagery, it is evident that the community was intended to expand below the delta of Mill Creek at the bay. Ghosts of about a dozen partially dredged lagoons in that area, as well as a curious curve in Newell Avenue, indicate the planned expansion. However, a lack of permits, increasing pressure from the EPA and the Wetlands Protection Act of 1970 kept the community from expanding further.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geography ==\u000aAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Beach Haven West had a total area of 2.143 square miles (5.551 km2), including 1.597 square miles (4.137 km2) of land and 0.546 square miles (1.414 km2) of water (25.47%).\u000aThe name "Beach Haven West" is a misnomer because it actually lies directly due north from the borough of Beach Haven. It can be speculated that "west" was chosen because the mainland is generally west of Long Beach Island, where Beach Haven is located.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Demographics ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Census 2010 ===\u000aAs of the 2010 United States Census, there were 3,896 people, 1,915 households, and 1,212 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 2,439.1 per square mile (941.7/km2). There were 4,571 housing units at an average density of 2,861.7 per square mile (1,104.9/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 97.33% (3,792) White, 0.49% (19) Black or African American, 0.23% (9) Native American, 0.72% (28) Asian, 0.00% (0) Pacific Islander, 0.69% (27) from other races, and 0.54% (21) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.77% (147) of the population.\u000aThere were 1,915 households out of which 11.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.5% were married couples living together, 6.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.7% were non-families. 32.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.03 and the average family size was 2.51.\u000aIn the CDP, the population was spread out with 10.0% under the age of 18, 5.6% from 18 to 24, 13.8% from 25 to 44, 36.9% from 45 to 64, and 33.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 57.9 years. For every 100 females there were 94.0 males. For every 100 females ages 18 and older there were 93.2 males.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Census 2000 ===\u000aAs of the 2000 United States Census there were 4,444 people, 2,086 households, and 1,372 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 849.4/km² (2,200.8/mi²). There were 4,514 housing units at an average density of 862.8/km² (2,235.5/mi²). The racial makeup of the CDP was 97.73% White, 0.36% African American, 0.02% Native American, 0.77% Asian, 0.09% Pacific Islander, 0.47% from other races, and 0.56% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.18% of the population.\u000aThere were 2,086 households out of which 14.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.2% were married couples living together, 6.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.2% were non-families. 28.9% of all households were made up of individuals and 14.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.13 and the average family size was 2.59.\u000aIn the CDP the population was spread out with 12.6% under the age of 18, 4.8% from 18 to 24, 19.7% from 25 to 44, 35.0% from 45 to 64, and 27.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 53 years. For every 100 females there were 94.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.7 males.\u000aThe median income for a household in the CDP was $45,508, and the median income for a family was $54,132. Males had a median income of $46,500 versus $30,491 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $39,273. About 1.5% of families and 3.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 1.5% of those under age 18 and 6.3% of those age 65 or over.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Community ==\u000aMany of the homes in Beach Haven West are summer residences for those who live in other parts of New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida and other states, although year-round residents have become more frequent. The area is served by the Stafford Township School District from grades K-6, and the Southern Regional School District from grades 7-12.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Homes ===\u000aThe first model home, an expandable Cape Cod-style house, opened on Selma Drive in 1957. Like many Capes, this home had one finished floor with two bedrooms, the attic was capable of expansion with dormers, and there was an outside shower. The style was pure 1950s: wide-exposure asbestos siding, aluminum jalousie windows throughout, and dark wood paneling inside. The colors were all pastels, ranging from canary yellow, pistachio green, and bright pink, to name a few. Mass production methods were utilized to erect the homes efficiently.\u000aThe lots were all 50 feet wide along the lagoon and 80 feet deep running towards the street. Phase one featured 60-foot-wide (18 m) lots. Double lots and irregular lots were available along the bends and corners of the lagoon. In the 1950s, waterfront lots with a house sold for $6,990, and financing of $66 a month was available.\u000aSoon, additional models were added and the two-bedroom cape was dropped. The least expensive was the Sandpiper model, totaling $11,990. which was a 3 bedroom ranch. Keeping the same modern architectural style, the three bedrooms were arranged along the front of the house facing the street. Behind them was a single full bath, a kitchenette, and a living room. All interior spaces featured exposed rafter vaulted ceilings with rigid insulation on the roof. Base models featured a screened porch stretching completely across the back of the house, which was covered by a long, gently sloping roof. A common upgrade was to have the porch enclosed with jalousie windows. The home was completed with an outdoor shower, an option of either a wooden bulkhead or a wooden deck along the lagoon, and two young willow trees in the back yard.\u000aThe largest model available was the Continental Riviera, which sold for about $23,000 in the 1970s. Homes in East Point and Village Harbour were built in the typical 1980s Post-Modern style. Colony Lakes homes were Colonial representative. All homes built by Lincoln were reversed living homes, where the bedrooms were downstairs and the living spaces on the second floor.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Beach Haven West Civic Association ===\u000aOriginally, the community had a recreation center located at intersection of Jonathan Drive, Morris Boulevard, Jennifer Lane, and Jeffrey Drive. The rec center featured a clubhouse, boat slips, and a swimming pool, which was the center of the Beach Haven West social scene throughout the 1950s and 1960s. By the 1980s, the pool was infilled and the clubhouse demolished. Modern 1980s-style homes were later built on the site, and belong to some of few homes in the complex which do not have waterfront access.\u000aThe Civic Association has been revitalized, and continues to operate at a new location on Mill Creek Road. It serves the community in many capacities, from "Mom and Me" playgroups and other Stafford Recreation-sponsored programs, to other usergroup functions (Stafford Township Regular Republican Club meetings) as well as a voting location on Election Days.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe 1974 Buffalo Bills season was the 15th season for the club in pro football and fifth in the National Football League (NFL). Buffalo made the NFL playoffs for the first time, and reached the postseason for the first time in eight seasons. In the playoffs, they lost to the eventual champions, the Pittsburgh Steelers, 32-14 in Pittsburgh. This was O.J. Simpson's only playoff game of his career, as the Bills did not have another playoff team with him on the team. Simpson would be traded to the 49ers in 1978, but the 49ers did not make the playoffs that season nor the 1979 season, Simpson's final season in the NFL. In the game, Simpson would only rush for 49 yards on 11 carries and did not score a touchdown. He did, however, catch a touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Ferguson late in the 3rd quarter.\u000aBuffalo debuted their new uniforms and helmets in 1974, replacing the red "standing buffalo" with the "streaking bison." The look first shown to a national audience on the first Monday Night Football game of the season, in a dramatic 21\u201320 victory over Oakland.\u000aStar running back O.J. Simpson, coming off consecutive rushing titles, did not lead the league in 1974, but did cross the 1,000-yard barrier despite a sore knee.\u000aBuffalo's defense was far more stout than it had been in previous years, as it gave up 3,489 yards in 1974, fifth-fewest in the NFL. The Bills' 1,611 passing yards allowed were the third-best in the league.\u000aThe 1974 Bills have the odd distinction of being the last team to go a full game without completing a pass, in Week Three of the season against the New York Jets. Despite this, they still managed to defeat the Jets, behind 223 combined Buffalo rushing yards\u2014as well as only 2 completions by Jets quarterback Joe Namath in 18 attempts.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Offseason ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== NFL draft ===\u000a\u000aOklahoma State tight end Reuben Gant played his entire seven-year career with the Bills.

aVMarion Gordon "Pat" Robertson (born March 22, 1930) is an American media mogul, executive chairman, and former Southern Baptist minister who advocates conservative Christian ideals. He presently serves as chancellor and CEO of Regent University and chairman of the Christian Broadcasting Network.\u000aSpanning over five decades, Robertson has a career as the founder of several major organizations and corporations as well as a university: The Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), the International Family Entertainment Inc. (ABC Family Channel), Regent University, the American Center for Law & Justice (ACLJ), the Founders Inn and Conference Center, the Christian Coalition, an L-1011 Flying Hospital, Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation, and CBN Asia. He is a best-selling author and the host of The 700 Club, a Christian News and TV program broadcast live weekdays on Freeform (formerly ABC Family) via satellite from CBN studios, as well as on channels throughout the United States, and on CBN network affiliates worldwide. He graduated near the top of his class at Yale Law School in 1955, but failed the New York bar exam. Failing the bar cost Robertson opportunities at post-graduate employment, and in the ensuing months of personal disappointment and unemployment, he converted to Christianity and began a career as a minister.\u000aThe son of U.S. Senator A. Willis Robertson, Robertson was a Southern Baptist and was active as an ordained minister with that denomination for many years, but holds to a charismatic theology not traditionally common among Southern Baptists.  He unsuccessfully campaigned to become the Republican Party's nominee in the 1988 presidential election. As a result of his seeking political office, he no longer serves in an official role for any church. His personal influence and media and financial resources make him a recognized, influential, and controversial public voice for conservative Christianity in the United States.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life and career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Family ===\u000aMarion Gordon Robertson was born on March 22, 1930, in Lexington, Virginia, into a prominent political family, the youngest of two sons. His parents were Absalom Willis Robertson (1887\u20131971), a conservative Democratic United States Senator, and his wife Gladys Churchill (née Willis; 1897\u20131968), was a housewife and a musician. He met Adelia "Dede" Elmer (born December 3, 1927 in Columbus, Ohio), a fashion model and beauty queen in the Miss Ohio State contest, who was studying for her masters in Nursing at Yale University. She was also a nursing student at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. They were married on August 26, 1954, and they were both on the path of economic success. His family includes four children, among them Gordon P. Robertson and Tim Robertson and, as of mid-2016, 14 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.\u000aAt a young age, Robertson was nicknamed Pat by his six-year-old brother, Willis Robertson, Jr., who enjoyed patting him on the cheeks when he was a baby while saying "pat, pat, pat". As he got older, Robertson thought about which first name he would like people to use. He considered "Marion" to be effeminate, and "M. Gordon" to be affected, so he opted for his childhood nickname "Pat". His strong awareness for the importance of names in the creation of a public image showed itself again during his presidential run when he threatened to sue NBC news for calling him a "television evangelist", which later became "televangelist", at a time when Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker were objects of scandal.\u000aOn April 2, 2015, fellow televangelist, Robert H. Schuller died after a two-year battle with esophageal cancer. Robertson released a statement through CBN News.com: "I am saddened by the passing of my dear friend, Robert Schuller, the Founding Pastor of Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California. Robert Schuller set the dimensions for Twentieth Century Christian positive thinking and optimistic action. He is now with the Lord in Heaven, but his legacy on earth will long remain."\u000aIn August 2017, Robertson was hospitalized after sustaining minor injuries from a horseback riding incident.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Education and military service ===\u000aWhen he was eleven, Robertson was enrolled in the preparatory McDonogh School outside Baltimore, Maryland. From 1940 until 1946 he attended The McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he graduated with honors. He gained admission to Washington and Lee University, where he received a B.A. in History, graduating magna cum laude. He joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Robertson has said, "Although I worked hard at my studies, my real major centered around lovely young ladies who attended the nearby girls schools."\u000aIn 1948, the draft was reinstated and Robertson was given the option of joining the Marine Corps or being drafted into the Army; he opted for the first.\u000aIn his words, "We did long, grueling marches to toughen the men, plus refresher training in firearms and bayonet combat." In the same year, he transferred to Korea, "I ended up at the headquarters command of the First Marine Division," says Robertson. "The Division was in combat in the hot and dusty, then bitterly cold portion of North Korea just above the 38th Parallel later identified as the 'Punchbowl' and 'Heartbreak Ridge.' For that service in the Korean War, the Marine Corps awarded me three battle stars for 'action against the enemy.'"\u000aHowever, former Republican Congressman Paul "Pete" McCloskey, Jr., who served with Robertson in Korea, wrote a public letter which said that Robertson was actually spared combat duty when his powerful father, a U.S. Senator, intervened on his behalf, and that Robertson spent most of his time in an office in Japan. According to McCloskey, his time in the service was not in combat but as the "liquor officer" responsible for keeping the officers' clubs supplied with alcohol. Robertson filed a $35 million libel suit against McCloskey in 1986. He dropped the case in 1988, before it came to trial and paid McCloskey's court costs. According to a newspaper report from 1986, Robertson confirmed elements of McCloskey's allegations and said that he never saw front-line duty.\u000aRobertson was promoted to First Lieutenant in 1952 upon his return to the United States. He then went on to receive a law degree from Yale Law School in 1955, near the top of his class. However, he failed his first and only attempt at the New York bar exam. Shortly thereafter he underwent a religious conversion, and decided against pursuing a career in law. Instead, Robertson attended The Biblical Seminary in New York, where he received a Master of Divinity degree in 1959.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Christian broadcasting and higher education career ===\u000a\u000aIn 1956 Robertson met Dutch missionary Cornelius Vanderbreggen, who impressed Robertson both by his lifestyle and his message. Vanderbreggen quoted Proverbs (3:5, 6), "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths", which Robertson considers to be the "guiding principle" of his life. He was ordained as a minister of the Southern Baptist Convention in 1961.\u000aIn 1960, Robertson established the Christian Broadcasting Network in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He started it by buying a small UHF station in nearby Portsmouth. Later in 1977 he purchased a local Leased access cable TV channel in the Hampton Roads area and called it CBN. Originally he went door-to-door in Virginia Beach, Hampton Roads, and other surrounding areas asking Christians to buy cable boxes so that they could receive his new channel. He also canvassed local churches in the Virginia Beach area to do the same, and solicited donations through public speaking engagements at local churches and on CBN. One of his friends, John Giminez, the pastor of Rock Church Virginia Beach, was influential in helping Robertson establish CBN with donations, as well as offering the services of volunteers from his church.\u000aCBN is now seen in 180 countries and broadcast in 71 languages. He founded the CBN Cable Network, which was renamed the CBN Family Channel in 1988 and later simply the Family Channel. When the Family Channel became too profitable for Robertson to keep it under the CBN umbrella without endangering CBN's non-profit status, he formed International Family Entertainment Inc. in 1990 with the Family Channel as its main subsidiary. Robertson sold the Family Channel to the News Corporation in 1997, which renamed it Fox Family. A condition of the sale was that the station would continue airing Robertson's television program, The 700 Club, twice a day in perpetuity, regardless of any changes of ownership. The channel is now owned by Disney and run as Freeform. On December 3, 2007, Robertson resigned as chief executive of CBN; he was succeeded by his son, Gordon.\u000aRobertson founded CBN University in 1977 on CBN's Virginia Beach campus. It was renamed Regent University in 1989. Robertson serves as its chancellor. He is also founder and president of the American Center for Law & Justice, a major public interest law firm headquartered in Washington, D.C. and associated with Regent University School of Law in Virginia Beach, Virginia, that defends Constitutional freedoms and conservative Christian ideals. Occasional critics have characterized Robertson as an advocate of dominionism; the idea that Christians have a right to rule.\u000aIn 1994, he was an endorser of the document Evangelicals and Catholics Together.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1988 presidential bid ===\u000a\u000aIn September 1986, Robertson announced his intention to seek the Republican nomination for President of the United States. Robertson said he would pursue the nomination only if three million people signed up to volunteer for his campaign by September 1987. Three million responded, and by the time Robertson announced he would be running in September 1987, he also had raised millions of dollars for his campaign fund. He surrendered his ministerial credentials and turned leadership of CBN over to his son, Tim. His campaign, however, against incumbent Vice President George H. W. Bush, was seen as a long shot.\u000aRobertson ran on a standard conservative platform. Among his policies, he wanted to ban pornography, reform the education system, and eliminate departments such as the Department of Education and the Department of Energy. He also supported a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget.\u000aRobertson's campaign got off to a strong second-place finish in the Iowa caucus, ahead of Bush. He did poorly in the subsequent New Hampshire primary, however, and was unable to be competitive once the multiple-state primaries began. Robertson ended his campaign before the primaries were finished. His best finish was in Washington, winning the majority of caucus delegates. He later spoke at the 1988 Republican National Convention in New Orleans and told his remaining supporters to cast their votes for Bush, who ended up winning the nomination and the election. He then returned to CBN and has remained there as a religious broadcasting broadcaster.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Books ===\u000a\u000aRobertson's book The New World Order (1991) became a New York Times best seller, among his several works. Episcopalian professor of theology Ephraim Radner's critical review:\u000a\u000aIn his published writings, especially his 1991 book The New World Order, Pat Robertson has propagated theories about a worldwide Jewish conspiracy. Michael Land raised the issue in February in The New York Times Book Review, and in April Jacob Heilbrun, writing in The New York Review of Books, cited chapter and verse of Robertson's borrowings from well-known anti-Semitic works.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Business interests ===\u000aRobertson is the founder and chairman of The Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) Inc., and founder of International Family Entertainment Inc., Regent University, Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation, American Center for Law and Justice, The Flying Hospital, Inc. and several other organizations and broadcast entities. Robertson was the founder and co-chairman of International Family Entertainment Inc. (IFE).\u000aFormed in 1990, IFE produced and distributed family entertainment and information programming worldwide. IFE's principal business was The Family Channel, a satellite delivered cable-television network with 63 million U.S. subscribers. IFE, a publicly held company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, was sold in 1997 to Fox Kids Worldwide, Inc. for $1.9 billion, whereupon it was renamed Fox Family Channel. Disney acquired FFC in 2001 and its name was changed again, to ABC Family. The network was renamed to Freeform on January 12, 2016, though Robertson's sale of the channel continues to require Freeform to carry four hours of CBN/700 Club programming per weekday, along with CBN's yearly telethon.\u000aRobertson is a global businessman with media holdings in Asia, the United Kingdom, and Africa. He struck a deal with Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based General Nutrition Center to produce and market a weight-loss shake he created and promoted on The 700 Club.\u000aIn 1999, Robertson entered into a joint venture with the Bank of Scotland to provide financial services in the United States. However, the move was met with criticism in the UK due to Robertson's views on homosexuality. Robertson commented that \u201cIn Europe, the big word is tolerance. You tolerate everything. Homosexuals are riding high in the media ... And in Scotland, you can't believe how strong the homosexuals are." Shortly afterward, the Bank of Scotland canceled the venture.\u000aRobertson's extensive business interests have earned him a net worth estimated between $200 million and $1 billion.\u000aA fan of Thoroughbred horse racing, Robertson paid $520,000 for a colt he named Mr. Pat. Trained by John Kimmel, Mr. Pat was not a successful runner. He was nominated for, but did not run in, the 2000 Kentucky Derby.\u000aIn 1994, in the aftermath of the Rwandan Genocide, Robertson solicited donations for his charity organization Operation Blessing International to provide medical supplies to refugees in neighboring Zaire (present-day Congo), where Robertson had allegedly negotiated a diamond-mining contract with Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. According to two Operation Blessing pilots who reported the incident to the state of Virginia for investigation, rather than delivering relief supplies to refugees, the organization's planes were primarily used to haul diamond-mining equipment to Robertson's mines in Zaire.\u000aAccording to a June 2, 1999, article in The Virginian-Pilot, Robertson had extensive business dealings with Liberian president Charles Taylor, with whom Robertson negotiated a multimillion-dollar contract for gold mining operations in Liberia. In response to Taylor's alleged crimes against humanity, the United States Congress passed a bill In November 2003 that offered two million dollars for his capture. Robertson accused President George W. Bush of "undermining a Christian, Baptist president to bring in Muslim rebels to take over the country." At the time Taylor was harboring Al Qaeda operatives who were funding their operations through the illegal diamond trade. On February 4, 2010, at his war crimes trial in the Hague, Taylor testified that Robertson was his main political ally in the U.S., and that he had volunteered to make Liberia's case before U.S. administration officials in exchange for concessions to Robertson's Freedom Gold, Ltd., to which Taylor gave a contract to mine gold in southeast Liberia. In 2010, a spokesman for Robertson said that the company's arrangements\u2014in which the Liberian government got a 10 percent equity interest in the company and Liberians could purchase at least 15 percent of the shares after the exploration period\u2014were similar to many American companies doing business in Africa at the time.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Political service and activism ==\u000aRobertson served as the past president of the Council for National Policy. In 1982, he served on the Victims of Crime Task Force for President Reagan. In Virginia, he served on the Board of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership and on the Governor\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors. After his unsuccessful presidential campaign, Robertson started the Christian Coalition, a 1.7-million-member Christian right organization that campaigned mostly for conservative candidates. Billy McCormack, a Southern Baptist pastor in Shreveport, Louisiana, served as one of the four directors of the coalition as well as its vice president. The coalition was sued by the Federal Election Commission "for coordinating its activities with Republican candidates for office in 1990, 1992 and 1994 and failing to report its expenditures". Robertson was a fundraiser for the Nicaraguan Contras. In March 1986, he told Israeli Foreign Affairs that South Africa was a major contributor to the Reagan administration's efforts to help the anti-Sandinista forces.\u000aIn 1994, the Coalition was fined for "improperly [aiding] then Representative Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Oliver North, who was then the Republican Senate nominee in Virginia." Robertson left the Coalition in 2001.\u000aRobertson has been a governing member of the Council for National Policy (CNP): Board of Governors 1982, President Executive Committee 1985\u201386, member, 1984, 1988, 1998.\u000aOn November 7, 2007, Robertson announced that he was endorsing Rudy Giuliani to be the Republican nominee in the 2008 Presidential election. Some social conservatives criticized Robertson's endorsement of Giuliani, a pro-choice candidate who supported gay rights.\u000aWhile usually associated with the political right, Pat Robertson has endorsed environmental causes. He appeared in a commercial with Al Sharpton, joking about this, and urging people to join the We Can Solve It campaign against global warming.\u000aIn January 2009, on a broadcast of The 700 Club, Robertson stated that he is "adamantly opposed" to the division of Jerusalem between Israel and the Palestinians. He also stated that Armageddon is "not going to be fought at Megiddo" but will be the "battle of Jerusalem," when "the forces of all nations come together and try to take Jerusalem away from the Jews. Jews are not going to give up Jerusalem\u2014they shouldn't\u2014and the rest of the world is going to insist they give it up." Robertson added that Jerusalem is a "spiritual symbol that must not be given away" because "Jesus Christ the Messiah will come down to the part of Jerusalem that the Arabs want," and that's "not good."\u000aRobertson has repeatedly called for the legalization of cannabis, saying that it should be treated in a manner analogous to the regulation of alcoholic beverages and tobacco. Robertson has said, "I just think it's shocking how many of these young people wind up in prison and they get turned into hard-core criminals because they had a possession of a very small amount of controlled substance. The whole thing is crazy."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Controversies and criticisms ==\u000a\u000aAs a commentator and minister, Robertson has occasionally addressed controversial topics, and made a number of bold statements to draw attention to a wide range of issues that have attracted criticism as well as support. Some of his remarks have been the subject of national and international media attention prompting responses from politicians.\u000aRobertson's service as a minister has included the belief in the healing power of God. He has cautioned believers that some Protestant denominations may harbor the spirit of the Antichrist; prayed to deflect hurricanes; denounced Hinduism as "demonic" and Islam as "Satanic". Robertson has denounced left-wing views of feminism, activism regarding homosexuality, abortion, and liberal college professors. Critics claim Robertson had business dealings in Africa with former presidents Charles Taylor of Liberia and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire who both had been internationally denounced for claims of human rights violations. Robertson was criticized worldwide for his call for Hugo Chávez\u2019s assassination and for his remarks concerning Ariel Sharon's ill-health as an act of God.\u000aRobertson made American national news in October 2003 for interviews with author Joel Mowbray about his book Dangerous Diplomacy, a book critical of the United States Department of State. Robertson's commentary implied that if a small nuclear device were to be found at the State Department, such a thing might wake up America's leaders to actually realize a potential threat; however, government officials expressed disdain at the thought of such a scenario.\u000a\u000aDuring the week of September 11, 2001, Robertson discussed the terror attacks with Jerry Falwell, who said that "the ACLU has to take a lot of blame for this" in addition to "the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays, and the lesbians [who have] helped [the terror attacks of September 11th] happen." Robertson replied, "I totally concur". Both evangelists were seriously criticized by President George W. Bush for their commentary, for which Falwell later issued an apology.\u000aLess than two weeks after Hurricane Katrina killed 1,836 people, Robertson implied on the September 12, 2005 broadcast of The 700 Club that the storm was God's punishment in response to America's abortion policy. He suggested that the September 11 attacks and the disaster in New Orleans "could [...] be connected in some way".\u000aOn November 9, 2009, Robertson said that Islam is "a violent political system bent on the overthrow of the governments of the world and world domination". He went on to elaborate that "you're dealing with not a religion, you're dealing with a political system, and I think we should treat it as such, and treat its adherents as such as we would members of the communist party, members of some fascist group".\u000aRobertson's response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake also drew controversy and condemnation. Robertson claimed that Haiti's founders had sworn a "pact to the Devil" in order to liberate themselves from the French slave owners and indirectly attributed the earthquake to the consequences of the Haitian people being "cursed" for doing so. CBN later issued a statement saying that Robertson's comments "were based on the widely-discussed 1791 slave rebellion led by Dutty Boukman at Bois Caïman, where the slaves allegedly made a famous pact with the devil in exchange for victory over the French". Various figures in mainline and evangelical Christianity have on occasion disavowed some of Robertson's remarks.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Predictions ==\u000aSeveral times near New Year, Robertson has announced that God told him several truths or events that would happen in the following year. "I have a relatively good track record", he said. "Sometimes I miss."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1982: Doomsday ===\u000aIn late 1976, Robertson predicted that the end of the world was coming in October or November 1982. In a May 1980 broadcast of The 700 Club he stated, "I guarantee you by the end of 1982 there is going to be a judgment on the world."\u000aIn September 2011, Robertson and several others who incorrectly predicted various dates for the end of world were jointly awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for "teaching the world to be careful when making mathematical assumptions and calculations".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2004: Presidential election ===\u000aIn January 2004, Robertson said that God told him President Bush will be re-elected in a "blowout" in the election later that year. "I think George Bush is going to win in a walk", Robertson told viewers of his The 700 Club program. "I really believe I'm hearing from the Lord it's going to be like a blowout election in 2004. It's shaping up that way." Bush did in fact win re-election, but not in a landslide. The 2004 race between Bush and John Kerry was one of the closest large elections in history.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2006: Pacific Northwestern tsunami ===\u000aIn May 2006, Robertson declared that storms and possibly a tsunami would hit America's coastline sometime in 2006. Robertson supposedly received this revelation from God during an annual personal prayer retreat in January. The claim was repeated four times on The 700 Club.\u000aOn May 8, 2006, Robertson said, "If I heard the Lord right about 2006, the coasts of America will be lashed by storms." On May 17, 2006, he elaborated, "There well may be something as bad as a tsunami in the Pacific Northwest."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2007: Terror attack ===\u000aOn the January 2, 2007, broadcast of The 700 Club, Robertson said that God spoke to him and told him that "mass killings" were to come during 2007, due to a terrorist attack on the United States. He added, "The Lord didn't say nuclear. But I do believe it will be something like that." When a terrorist attack failed to happen in 2007, Robertson said, in January 2008, "All I can think is that somehow the people of God prayed and God in his mercy spared us."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2008: Worldwide violence and American recession ===\u000aOn the January 2, 2008 episode of The 700 Club, Pat Robertson predicted that 2008 would be a year of worldwide violence. He also predicted that a recession would occur in the United States that would be followed by a stock market crash by 2010. However, there was a decrease in overall deaths for the period, and the American economy had already entered a recession in 2007, with increased household debt and the collapse of financial institutions.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2008: Mideast meltdown ===\u000aIn October 2008, Robertson posted a press release on the Georgian conflict speculating that the conflict is a Russian ploy to enter the Middle East, and that instability caused by a predicted pre-emptive strike by Israel on Iran would result in Syria's and Iran's launching nuclear strikes on other targets. He also said that if the United States were to oppose Russia's expansion, nuclear strikes on American soil are also pending. "We will suffer grave economic damage, but will not engage in military action to stop the conflict. However, we may not be spared nuclear strikes against coastal cities. In conclusion, it is my opinion that we have between 75 and 120 days before the Middle East starts spinning out of control."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2009: Economic chaos and recovery ===\u000aOn the January 1, 2009 broadcast of The 700 Club, Robertson said, "If I'm hearing [God] right, gold will go to about $1900 an ounce and oil to $300 a barrel." He also suggested that Americans would broadly accept socialism. Despite these predictions, he also said that economically "things are getting ready to turn around."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2012: Presidential election ===\u000aOn January 4, 2012, Robertson reported that God had spoken to him and he "thinks He showed me the next president" but would not name who it is. He did give an indication that it would not be President Obama since Robertson said God told him Obama's views were at "odds with the majority", but left some room for interpretation had the 2012 election expanded beyond a two-person race. Closer to the election, however, he expressly stated that God had told him that Mitt Romney would win and would be a two-term President. Obama was reelected for a second term.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Works ==\u000aShout It from the Housetops, an autobiography with Jamie Buckingham (1972, repr 1995)\u000aThe Secret Kingdom (1982)\u000aAnswers to 200 of Life's Most Probing Questions (1984)\u000aBeyond Reason: How Miracles can Change your Life (1985)\u000aAmerica's Dates with Destiny (1986)\u000aThe Plan (1989)\u000aThe New Millennium (1990)\u000aThe New World Order (1991)\u000aTurning Tide: The Fall of Liberalism and the Rise of Common Sense (1993) ISBN 978-0-8499-0972-6\u000aThe End of the Age (1995, fiction)\u000aBring It on: Tough Questions, Candid Answers, Nashville, Tenn: W Pub.

aVXining (Chinese: \u897f\u5b81 X\u012bníng [\u0255í.n\u01d0\u014b]; Standard Tibetan: \u0f5f\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f63\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f0d Ziling) is the capital of Qinghai province in western China, and the largest city on the Tibetan Plateau. It has 2,208,708 inhabitants at the 2010 census whom 1,198,304 live in the built up area made of 4 urban districts.\u000aThe city was a commercial hub along the Northern Silk Road's Hexi Corridor for over 2000 years, and was a stronghold of the Han, Sui, Tang, and Song dynasties' resistance against nomadic attacks from the west. Although long a part of Gansu province, Xining was added to Qinghai in 1928. Xining holds sites of religious significance to Muslims and Buddhists, including the Dongguan Mosque and Ta'er Monastery. The city lies in the Huangshui River valley, and owing to its high altitude, has a cold semi-arid climate. It is connected by rail to Lhasa, Tibet and connected by high-speed rail to Lanzhou, Gansu and Ürümqi, Xinjiang.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aXining has a history of over 2,100 years and was a chief commercial hub on the Hexi Corridor caravan route to Tibet, handling especially timber, wool and salt in ancient times. The trade along the Hexi Corridor was part of a larger trade corridor along the Northern Silk Road, whose use was intensified in the 1st century BC after efforts by the Han dynasty to control this route.\u000aUnder the Han dynasty (206 BC \u2013 220 AD) a county called Linqiang was established to control the local Qiang tribesmen. It was again a frontier county under the Sui (581\u2013618) and Tang (618\u2013907) dynasties; during the 7th and early 8th centuries it was a center of constant warfare with Tuyuhun and Tibet. In 763, it was overrun by the Tibetans and while under Tibetan control was known to the Chinese as Qingtangcheng. Recovered by the Song dynasty in 1104, it received the name Xining (meaning "peace in the west") and has been the seat of a prefecture or superior prefecture under that name since that time. In the late 16th century, the Kumbum Monastery was founded some 19 km (12 mi) to the southeast, establishing Xining as an important religious center for the Gelug School of Buddhists.\u000aA major earthquake occurred May 22, 1927, measuring at a magnitude of 7.6. It was one of the deadliest earthquakes in China with a total count of over 40,000 deaths. It also caused large land fractures.\u000aXining was the extraterritorial capital of the Koko Nor territory and remained in Gansu until 1928, when it became the provincial capital of the newly established independent province of Qinghai.\u000aXining was subjected to aerial bombardment by Japanese warplanes in 1941 during the Second-Sino Japanese War. The bombing spurred all ethnicities in Qinghai, including the local Qinghai Mongols and Qinghai Tibetans, against the Japanese. The Salar Muslim General Han Youwen directed the defense of the city of Xining during air raids by Japanese planes. Han survived an aerial bombardment by Japanese planes in Xining while he was being directed via telephone from Ma Bufang, who hid in an air raid shelter in a military barracks. The bombing resulted in human flesh splattering a Blue Sky with a White Sun flag and Han being buried in rubble. Han Youwen was dragged out of the rubble while bleeding and he managed to grab a machine gun while he was limping and fired back at the Japanese warplanes and cursed the Japanese as dogs in his native Salar language.\u000aMa Bukang and Ma Bufang were having a discussion on Ma Biao when Japanese warplanes bombed Xining.\u000aXining was given municipal status in 1945.\u000aUnder the rule of Governor Ma Bufang, Xining, like the rest of Qinghai, underwent industrialization and modernization. In 1947 the USA sold Ma Bufang a piped water (sewage) system which was installed in Xining. Ma Bufang also promoted education. He made businessmen methodically clean up Xining by serving as insect exterminators, killing flies and neatly throwing them away.\u000aSince the late 1950s, when the Liujia Gorge Dam and hydroelectric project came into operation in neighboring Gansu province, Xining has been linked by a high-tension electrical grid to both Liujia and Lanzhou. It also uses local coal from mines at Datongxian to the north. A modern woollen mill was installed at Xining before 1957. The city also has a leather industry and is a market for salt from the Qaidam region. During the late 1950s medium-sized iron and steelworks were built there, supplying metal to Lanzhou.\u000aConstruction of a highway to the mineral-rich Qaidam basin, and completion in 1959 a link to the Chinese rail network via Lanzhou in Gansu province, has spurred industrial development. This effort was part of a plan of the central government to rapidly exploit oil and pasturage in the Xining area beginning in the 1950s.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geography and climate ==\u000aXining is located in the eastern part of Qinghai Province and lies on the Huangshui River. It has a total area of 350 km2 (140 sq mi).\u000aXining is located on the eastern edge of the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau and the upper reaches of the Huangshui River. It is the political, economic, and cultural center of Qinghai Province with an average altitude of about 2,200 metres (7,200 ft). Human activity in the region can be traced to 2,100 years ago. During the Western and Eastern Han dynasties, owing to its developing agriculture, Xining was paid noticed due to its economic and military significance. As well as being an important hinge between the Central Plains and the western part of China in ancient times, Xining was an important link in the Silk Road. It continues to be an important rail and road link to the hinterlands of the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau.\u000aXining has also been dubbed the Summer Resort Capital of China owing to its cool summer, with a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen BSk). Conditions are influenced by the aridity and high altitude. Nights are cold or cool throughout the year, and the diurnal temperature variation often reaches or exceeds 15 °C (27 °F). The monthly 24-hour average temperatures ranges from \u22127.4 °C (18.7 °F) in January to 17.3 °C (63.1 °F) in July; the annual mean is 6.10 °C (43.0 °F), still making it one of the warmest locations in Qinghai due to the low elevation by provincial standards. Rainfall falls mainly from May to September, and the area is often dry and sunny; With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 53 percent in September to 69 percent in November and January, the city receives 2,676 hours of bright sunshine per year. Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221226.6 °C (\u221216 °F) to 36.5 °C (98 °F).\u000a\u000a\u000a=== River management ===\u000aIn 2007, the World Bank lent US$1 billion to aid river treatment in Xining, including Sanxian County's anti-flooding project, with an added US$1 billion to support infrastructure. Qinghai has invested large amounts in the treatment of Huangshui Main River and Nanchuan River, totalling 24.5 km (15.2 mi). However, a treatment on a 40 km (25 mi) river course and 10 flash flood relief channels remain pending due to lack of equipment. In Sanxian County, a 108.4 m (356 ft) long river course and 80 flash flood relief channels need treatment.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Air quality ===\u000aAccording to a 2011 World Health Organization (based on Chinese statistics), Xining has the second worst air quality (annual mean PM10 ug/m3 of 141) among eleven western China cities, and is worse than Beijing (121).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Economy ==\u000a\u000aThe GDP per capita was 49,200 RMB (US$7,897) in 2015. Its main industries are wool spinning and textiles, fur, meat, milk, salt, and light processing industries.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Economic and Technological Development Zones ===\u000aXining Economic & Technological Development Zone\u000aXining Economic & Technological Development Zone XETDZ) was approved as state-level development zone in July 2000. It has a planned area of 4.4 km2 (1.7 sq mi). XETDZ lies in the east of Xining, 5 km (3.1 mi) away from downtown. The XETDZ is the first of its kind at the national level on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is established to fulfill the nation's strategy of developing the west.\u000aXETDZ enjoys a convenient transportation system, connected by the Xining\u2013Lanzhou expressway and run through by two main roads, the broadest roads of the city. It is 4 km (2.5 mi) away from the railway station, 15 km (9.3 mi) from Xining Airport.\u000aIt focuses on the development of following industries: chemicals based on salt lake resources, nonferrous metals, and petroleum and natural gas processing; special medicine, foods and bio-chemicals using local plateau animals and plants; new products involving ecological and environmental protection, high technology, new materials as well as information technology; and services such as logistics, banking, real estate, tourism, hotel, catering, agency and international trade.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Population ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Demographics ===\u000a\u000aAccording to the 2010 Census, the prefecture-level city of Xining has a population of 2,208,708 inhabitants, 229,508 persons more than in 2000 (and the demographic growth for the period 2000\u20132010 was of 1.1 percent per year).\u000aAt present, four districts, three counties and a national economic and technological development zone are under the administration of the local government. With a population of more than two million, Xining is the first city on the upper reaches of the Yellow River to achieve a population in the millions.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ethnic diversity ===\u000aThere are about 37 nationalities living here, though only the Han, Hui, Monguor (Tu people in Chinese: \u571f\u65cf) and Tibetan are numerically significant. Local traditions and customs are influenced by the Tibetans, Monguor, Muslims and Han. On 2010 Census numbers, Han Chinese represent 74.04 percent of the total population of Xining, while Hui (16.26 percent), Tibetan (5.51 percent) and Tu (2.6 percent) are the main minority groups in the city.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Religion ===\u000a\u000aLocated in the southwest part of Xining City, the Kumbum Monastery or Ta'er Monastery is one of six famous monasteries in the Gelug (also called Yellow Hat Sect) of Tibetan Buddhism and has hundreds of monks.\u000aHaving a history of over 600 years, the Dongguan Mosque, located in the Xining City Zone, is one of the most famous mosques in the northwest region of China. It has splendid and diversiform towers, walls and halls in the mosque.\u000aAnother unique religious structure is the Beishan Si (North Mountain Temple), a Taoist facility.\u000aThere are more than 300 Christian meeting points in Xining.\u000aThe Catholic minority is pastorally served by the (pre-diocesan) Apostolic Prefecture of Xining.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Administrative divisions ==\u000aThe municipality oversees seven districts and counties. The data here are presented in km² and in population according to 2010 Census:\u000a\u000a\u000a== Education ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Colleges and universities ===\u000aQinghai University\u000aQinghai Normal University\u000aQinghai University for Nationalities\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Private schools ===\u000aXining International Academy is an English-language international school.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Tourism ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Transportation ==\u000a\u000aXining is situated in a fertile mountain basin in the valley of the Huangshui (river), a tributary of the Yellow River, that acts as a river port. The city lies about 200 km (120 mi) west of Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, on what was traditionally the main trade route from northern China into Tibet and the Qaidam Basin. These routes are now followed by modern highways.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Railway ===\u000a\u000aSince 1959 Xining has been connected by the Lanzhou\u2013Qinghai Railway to China's railway network. Later, this railway was extended into the Qaidam area via Haiyan near Qinghai Lake to Golmud, and, since 2006, to Lhasa, Tibet. (See the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Railway).\u000aThe second major railway serving Xining is the Lanzhou\u2013Xinjiang High-Speed Railway, opened in December 2014. When first opened, it just provided high-speed train service to Lanzhou and Urumqi (and points in between). Eventually, it will be connected to the rest of the nation's high-speed rail network.\u000aUnlike many other Chinese cities, where the conventional and high-speed trains stop at different train stations, Xining railway station is served by both types of trains. Thus it can be used as a transfer point for e.g. a passenger traveling from Xinjiang to Tibet.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Air ===\u000aXining Caojiabu Airport serves the area with regularly scheduled passenger flights to major Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Chengdu, Kunming, Xi'an, and Wuhan.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Highway ===\u000aChina National Highway 214\u000a\u000a\u000a== Food ==\u000a\u000aAs the capital of Qinghai province, Xining almost boasts all varieties of local flavors. Xining's cuisine is distinct from other varieties of Chinese cities using mainly food products native to the area. Food here is substantial, but quite inexpensive.\u000aIn Xining, some restaurants serve varieties of 'plateau flavor', such as Feng'er Liji (a round lamb tenderloin), Danbai Chongcao Ji (a medicine cuisine made of chicken, Chinese caterpillar fungus and eggs), Jinyu Facai (pork wrapped in flagelliform nostoc and shaped as a goldfish) among others. These dishes are often cooked by the locals at home.\u000aThere are also many small restaurants offering noodles. Gan Ban is a very common noodle dish. Perhaps Mian Pian, which means "noodle leaves" is the most common noodle plate among the Qinghai people. On the streets, many Muslims sell spicy lamb brochettes. Due to the cold climate, residents of Xining are also fond of strong spirits\u2014Xining has the reputation of being one of the heaviest regions of alcohol consumption in China.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aXining Government Website

aVThe Government Digital Service is a unit of the Government of the United Kingdom's Cabinet Office tasked with transforming the provision of government digital services. It was formed in April 2011 to implement the 'Digital by Default' strategy proposed by a report produced for the Cabinet Office in 2010 called 'Directgov 2010 and beyond: revolution not evolution'. It is overseen by the Public Expenditure Executive (Efficiency & Reform). GDS is primarily based in the Whitechapel Building, London. Its Director General is Kevin Cunnington.\u000a\u000a\u000a== GOV.UK ==\u000aOn 20 July 2010, Directgov, the citizen services website, was moved to the Cabinet Office from the Department for Work and Pensions. From 1 April 2011 Directgov became part of the Government Digital Service, along with the BusinessLink website aimed at business users. On 13 September 2012, through a notice on the Directgov homepage, it was announced that the GOV.UK project, built by the Government Digital Service, would replace Directgov as the primary citizen website of the UK Government on 17 October 2012, after which both Directgov and BusinessLink would close.\u000a\u000a\u000a== 'Digital by Default' strategy ==\u000aThe strategy was proposed in a report called 'Directgov 2010 and beyond: revolution not evolution' prepared by Martha Lane Fox, the founder of lastminute.com. In an interview, Francis Maude, minister with responsibility for GDS has spoken about "powerful oligopolies" and the reliance on a single supplier as a cause of high-profile failures in public sector IT, such as NHS Connecting for Health. GDS is intended to "drive service delivery to digital across government and provide support, advice and technical expertise for departments as they develop new digital delivery models". This strategy is focussed on the application of Agile software development and Lean software development methodologies, supplied primarily via small and medium enterprises rather than large suppliers.\u000aGDS has a 'Digital Advisory Board' consisting of high-profile external experts, which meets bi-annually and advises the GDS on strategy.\u000aAs of 2013, less than 2 years after GDS began, GDS had over 200 staff; by 2015 that number had risen to approximately 500.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Government as a Platform ==\u000aGDS has since mid 2013 promoted the concept of Government as a Platform, an idea first set out by Tim O'Reilly in 2009 in an article in Forbes. Government as a Platform introduces "a new vision for digital government; a common core infrastructure of shared digital systems, technology and processes on which it\u2019s easy to build brilliant, user-centric government services".\u000a\u000a\u000a== GOV.UK Verify ==\u000a\u000aIn 2011, GDS was given responsibility for setting cross-government standards for identity assurance, with the authority to approve, commission and accredit the identity component of any central government public service. GDS then designed and is building GOV.UK Verify. GOV.UK Verify is the way to prove who you are online, giving safer access to government services like filing your tax or checking the information on your driving licence. GOV.UK Verify allows you to choose from a list of companies certified to verify your identity to government. These companies have to meet published standards for identity assurance.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aCentral Computer and Telecommunications Agency\u000aOffice of the e-Envoy\u000aE-Government Unit\u000aTransformational Government\u000aPublic Sector Internal Identity Federation\u000aUnited States Digital Service, GDS' American counterpart\u000a18F, a similar organisation in the United States\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aGDS organisation page on UK Government website\u000aGovernment Digital Service blog

After Hibiki and the others departed to Tarak, Pyoro somehow sneaked back to the Pirates Base because of "his" desire to see "Pyoro-2", much to the distress of Rebecca, Kalua's Ouma. Meanwhile, Misty was stressed too, because she felt she didn't belong with the pirates since she's not from Mejere and Meia was trying to help by suggesting Misty to join the Event-planning crew, who are planning a welcome party for when Hibiki would return with the men from Taraak. At the same time, Ezra, Rebecca and Pyoro find out Kalua is missing...but Misty manages to find Kalua and because of how pleased both Ezra and Rebecca are, they have Misty be Kalua's godmother.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Hibiki & Dita Story ===\u000aFinally arriving on Tarak, BC and the other officials in Tarak were starting to plan for what to do during their trip. At the same time, they have encountered another problem about Hibiki. Since Hibiki is Grandpa and Grandma's child, the officials didn't know whether they should treat Hibiki as a diplomat or as the prince of their planet. In order to find out the answer, they wanted Hibiki to meet Grandpa and Grandma. Hibiki himself was also confused by the treatment he received from the officials and in great stress. The story closes when Hibiki and Dita get married and have a baby.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aVandread\u000aList of Vandread episodes

aVThe Little Nipper series was an RCA Victor series of records aimed at children first issued in 1944 on 78 RPM, and then on 45 RPM in the 1950s. In the 1950s, Little Nipper was especially used for "extended play" albums featuring only four or five songs. The Disney Studio released several short albums derived from their hit films, both musical and dramatic, on the "Little Nipper" series. These were two-record albums accompanied by a booklet slipcover featuring the spoken text of the album so that the young listener could follow along.\u000aSometimes several selections from a Broadway cast album would be featured on Little Nipper albums, especially one which children would enjoy. One of these featured four songs from the cast album of Peter Pan, starring Mary Martin.\u000a"Nipper" was the name of the dog whose picture was shown with the slogan "His Master's Voice" and which later became the trademark of RCA. "Little nipper" is an English colloquial term (originally a seafaring term) for a young boy or small child, so "Little Nipper" was an obvious choice of name for RCA records for children.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Honda Elite is a series of scooters manufactured by Honda since 1983. Honda currently makes the 108 cc (6.6 cu in) 2010 Elite.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Elite 80 ==\u000aIn 1984, Honda released its first four-stroke modern scooter, the Elite 125. Later, Honda introduced the four-stroke Elite 80 (model code CH80) in 1985.\u000aProduction was moved from Japan to Mexico in 1991, and production ended in 2007. The Elite 80 had a 23 model year run with only minor changes.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Elite 125/150 ==\u000aHonda released its first mid-sized four-stroke scooter onto the western market in the spring of 1984. The Elite 125 (CH125) continued Honda's trend of shifting from two-stroke engines to the much more emissions friendly four-stroke engine. The 1984 Elite featured many new technologies never before seen on a conventional scooter, such as a retractable headlamp, liquid-cooled engine, a digital dashboard, and more.\u000aFor 1985, Honda brought back its mid-sized scooter along with some modifications. Two of these changes were that the engine size was increased from 125 cc (7.6 cu in) to 150 cc (9.2 cu in) (thus changing the model name to the Elite 150) and that the Elite 150 was now being sold in two editions, the standard model, and a deluxe model. The deluxe model (CH150D) shared an almost identical body and frame as the Elite 125, including a digital instrument cluster and flip-up headlamp, while the standard model (CH150) got a more conventional pedicure, featuring an analog dashboard, and a fixed headlamp.\u000a1986 saw the elimination of the standard model Elite 150, leaving the Deluxe model as the only remaining mid-sized scooter Honda had to offer. Styling revisions for the Honda CH150 in 1987 included a transition from a boxy to a curvier, more rounded look. Although its appearance differed from its predecessor, the revised Elite 150 received few mechanical modifications.

aVThe TurboSPARC is a microprocessor that implements the SPARC V8 instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by Fujitsu Microelectronics, Inc. (FMI), the United States subsidiary of the Japanese multinational information technology equipment and services company Fujitsu Limited located in San Jose, California. It was a low-end microprocessor primarily developed as an upgrade for the Sun Microsystems microSPARC-II-based SPARCstation 5 workstation. It was introduced on 30 September 1996, with a 170 MHz version priced at US$499 in quantities of 1,000. The TurboSPARC was mostly succeeded in the low-end SPARC market by the UltraSPARC IIi in late 1997, but remained available.\u000aUsers of the TurboSPARC were Force Computers, Fujitsu, RDI Computer, Opus Systems, Tadpole Technologies, Tatung Science and Technology and Themis Computers. Fujitsu used a 160 MHz version in a SPARCstation 5 upgrade kit, whereas the other companies used the 170 MHz version in workstation, notebook and embedded computers.\u000aThe performance of the 170 MHz TurboSPARC was similar to that of a 120 MHz Intel Pentium, but when compared to a 110 MHz microSPARC-II, it had two times the integer performance and one and a half times the floating-point performance.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description ==\u000aThe TurboSPARC was a simple scalar in-order design. During the fetch stage, two instructions were fetched from a 16 KB direct-mapped instruction cache. During the decode stage, one instruction was decoded, and its operands read from its register file. Execution began in stage three. The TurboSPARC had an integer unit and a floating-point unit. Most integer arithmetic instructions except for multiply and divide have a single-cycle latency. Multiply and divide was executed by the FPU. Multiply had a seven cycle latency while divide had an 8- to 33-cycle latency. Most floating-point arithmetic instructions except for divide and square-root had a four-cycle latency.\u000aMemory access occurs during stage four. The TurboSPARC has a 16 KB data cache. The cache is direct-mapped and uses a write back write policy. If there is a data cache hit, data is returned in the same cycle, and checked for errors during stage five. Integer results and loads are written to the register file during stage six. Floating-point instructions, which take more cycles are completed by stage seven and written to the floating-point register file during stage eight.\u000aThe TurboSPARC had an integrated controllers for the L2 cache, memory, AFX interface and SBus interface. A 256 KB, 512 KB or 1 MB external L2 cache was supported. The cache operated at half or one-third the internal clock frequency: 85 or 56.67 MHz respectively at 170 MHz. It was direct-mapped, had a 32-byte line size and used a write-through write policy. It was parity protected. The cache was built from 12 ns pipelined burst static random access memory (PBSRAM). Memory controller supported 8 to 256 MB of fast page mode (FPM) DRAM in eight banks. The L2 cache and memory were accessed using the system bus, a 72-bit wide bus, of which 64 bits were for data.\u000aThe AFX interface enabled AFX graphics cards to directly access the memory. It shares the same data bus with the cache and memory controllers but used its own control lines. The SBus controller had its own 16-entry input/output translation lookaside buffer. TurboSPARC supported SBus frequencys of 16.67 to 25 MHz. The TurboSPARC was not multiprocessor-capable.\u000aThe TurboSPARC contained 3.0 million transistors and measured 11.5 by 11.5 mm for a die area of 132.25 mm2. It was fabricated by Fujitsu in their CS-60ALE process, a 0.35 µm four-level metal complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS) process. The TurboSPARC was packaged in a 416-ball plastic ball grid array (PBGA). It used a 3.3 V power supply and had a 9 W maximum power dissipation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aFujitsu Microelectronics, Inc. (30 September 1996).

aVIn the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy roleplaying game, "rabble of devilkin" is a term applied to the lesser unique outcast devils dwelling on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description ==\u000aThere are roughly fifty of these unique devils, nearly all who seek to regain their place in Hell's hierarchy.\u000aThese outcasts are forbidden to create strongholds from which to gather resources, so most wander Avernus, or hide in several secret lairs. Most of the outcasts avoid each other, and few beyond Asmodeus and his representatives are allowed friendly contact with them. They seldom take part in the Blood War that takes place on Avernus, save only when they are personally attacked by participants. The devils Amduscias, Malphas, and Goap work to keep these outcasts in line.\u000aThe following are outcast devils of Avernus known by name:\u000aAmon is late arch-Duke Geryon's former lieutenant. Also known as "the Wolf," this human-appearing fiend with a wolf's head owns a winter wolf servant and is one of the few survivors of Levistus's attack on Geryon's court.\u000aArmaros, "The Resolver of Enchantments," is one of the most powerful beings in Baator. A very skilled arcane spellcaster, his spellcasting power is rumored to be greater than any other devil, even Asmodeus. For this reason, it is said, the Lord of Nessus exiled Armaros to Avernus and forbids any other Dukes to have contact with the exile. Armaros is content with his condition and wants nothing more than to be left alone to practice his magic undisturbed. He could have served Asmodeus directly but due to his feuds with the other generals of Baator's Overlord (especially Adramalech and Phongor), this is not possible. He's said to be visited by Asmodeus quite often. Armaros appears as a gray-skinned, handsome human male with dark gray wings and luminescent blue eyes.\u000aAzazel "the Serpent," is extremely conceited and scornful. Cast out of two successive dukedoms for his unbearable behaviour, Azazel constantly plots to regain his former position. He always wears gaudy jewelry and regal clothing. He considers only Asmodeus, Baalzebul, Mephistopheles, and Adramalech his equals. Azazel is a scaly-skinned humanoid with a serpent's head and large scaled wings.\u000aThe violent female devil known as Bist has a strong affinity with hellcats. Completely selfish, she is a mistress of duplicity and is mistrusted by all the other devils of Baator. As such, she has been ordered to change her name and, unlike other hellcats, can not be summoned to any other planes. She appears as an exceptionally large, ghost-like hellcat with glowing orange eyes.\u000aCahor, "The Deceiver," is a renowned trouble-maker. His main concern is creating chaos in Avernus, misinforming and conning all the ones he meets, in order to thwart and upset diabolic plans. This chaotic behavior got him exiled to Avernus. The only reason why he hasn't been readily destroyed is that his antics also mislead the demons. His true form is that of a mottled gray malebranche, but he seldom appears as such.\u000aThe sneaky but yet very charismatic, Caim is a gossip loathed by all the arch-Dukes of Hell. Caim is an avian creature looking somewhat like a thrush and sports large wings and a bird's head.\u000aDagon was formerly known as Jaqon, his true name. Jaqon was the herald and messenger of Asmodeus. He could travel the planes freely and often used to deal with mortals and beings of the Prime Material Plane. But he would also divulge the true names of various devils, especially the arch-Duchesses, which caused him to be violently hated by the consorts of Hell. Resented by all devilkind, Jaqon was cast out to Avernus but Asmodeus chose not to slay him because his knowledge of the consorts' true names is a good mean of ensuring the loyalty of the arch-Duchesses. Jaqon was finally renamed so that he couldn't be summoned anymore. He appears as a red-skinned satyr with a hairless, slyly handsome face. His green eyes glow when angered. He sports a disturbing resemblance to Titivilus, Dispater's nuncio. Dagon is also the name of a powerful demon prince who took this taunt from Hell's Overlord as a major offense.\u000aElusive, secretive, and mysterious Duskur, "The Dark Lady", is a ravishingly beautiful female-devil known to have spurned consortship offers from both Geryon and Belial. Preferring her relative freedom on Avernus, she chose to never have a mate and roams the First Layer with her armies of skeletons and zombies. She appears as a winged human female with snow-white skin, shiny black eyes and dead black hair. She is seldom seen but can be heard singing in an ethereal, fluting voice from time to time in Avernus, however she dislikes all forms of music.\u000aHerodias, former magistrate to Geryon, is another survivor of the Wild Beast's court. A scarlet bodied creature of massive build, Herodias appears strangely human otherwise, despite his sinister grin and his hooves.\u000aThe advanced pit-fiend Kochbiel was the former marshal to the archdevil Beherit, the now-destroyed Lord of the Sixth. Another duke exiled for political reasons, Kochbiel is a very skillful and calculating general of cold manners who rules his troops with an iron hand. Due to his might, one of the greatest among the Exiles, he is greatly feared and respected. Having conquered quite a bunch of strategical places in Avernus, the former marshal's main concern at the moment is to reinforce the connections between them and his authority over them. He is a great rival to Nergal. Kochbiel appears as a burly, exceptionally large pit-fiend of gray skin with a set of 4 massively muscled arms. His yellow eyes violently contrast with his deep purple inner mouth and tongue.\u000aAggressive and embittered Malarea is acknowledged by all in Hell for her domineering personality. This erinyes-looking she-devil longs to join the ranks of Hell's consorts at any price. Thus, she already personally assaulted the arch-Duchesses out of envy, only to be grimly defeated. She has sought out Bel for consortship but he rebuffed her, leaving Malarea even more frustrated. She appears as a tall human female with deep red eyes, black hair and very large black wings. Her powerfully muscled body glows a ghostly light and she has vampire-like fangs for canine teeth.\u000aMoloch, former viceroy of Baalzebul and former Lord of the Sixth, was set up for his downfall by the Hag Countess, his former lover. After having wondered the planes for a while, Moloch is back in Baator and tries to regain his lost status but any scheme he came up with has failed so far.\u000aNergal, among the most powerful of the rabble, sometimes called "The Bringer of Pestilence and Fever", is a gruesome Duke of very unusual appearance. Exiled to Avernus after being denied the control of Malbolge after the destruction of Beherit, he tries to raise more power on Avernus and is in competition with the pit-fiend Kochbiel. Nergal is a lion headed toad who sports a pinkish-gray, purulent skin covered in sores that ooze a colorless, poisonous ichor.\u000aKnown as the Poisoner of Hell Nisroch, "The Eagle", is an observing, polite and mocking Duke. Exiled to Avernus for killing the duke Senciner and nearly slaying Abigor, he has now very little chance to perform his favorite trick (poisoning sumptuous meals). Still, he continues to invent and produce deadly poisons with the rare ingredients of Avernus, poisoning various items at random to surprise his unwary victims. Nisroch looks very much like the Tanar'ri Prince Pazuzu: he is an eagle-headed humanoid male with talons for legs and a leathery skin. His feathery areas are black and the only thing that distinguishes him from the demon Prince of Aerial Kingdoms is his set of bat-like wings.\u000aThe proud Rumjal is another former lieutenant to Geryon. Exiled to Avernus for the molestation of Geryon's consort, Cozbi, this very resentful Duke wields his frustration by tormenting lesser devils and weak non-Baatezus. However, Rumjal appears to the world as surprisingly good-natured, polite and straightforward devil who enjoys art, dark poetry and wit. He still considers himself a rightful Duke of Hell who temporarily fell from prestige. Now that both Geryon and Cozbi are dead, he wishes to reintegrate the hierarchy of Hell by acting in a loyal, very useful way. This might happen since Asmodeus appreciates him and sometimes plays chess with him for recreation. Rumjal is a tall, heavily muscled, hairless humanoid of gray skin and white horns. He sports a white tail that ends in three curving points.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Additional reading ==\u000aGreenwood, Ed. "The Nine Hells Part I."

aVThe Citroën B2 is the second model produced by Citroën. It is therefore the second European car to have been constructed according to modern mass production technologies. It was produced at André Citroën's factory in central Paris between May 1921 and July 1926.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Context ==\u000aThe Citroën B2 replaced the Citroën Type A in June 1921, although the "Type A" would continue to be listed for sale till December 1921.\u000a\u000a\u000a== The car ==\u000aThe new car offered more power, the size of its 4-cylinder engine now being increased to 1,452 cc. The car was sometimes known as the Citroën 10HP (or 10CV), the HP in the suffix being a reference to its fiscal horsepower, a number computed according to the cylinder diameters and used to define its taxation class. In terms of engine power, maximum output was listed as 20 bhp at 2,100 rpm, which translated into a claimed top speed of 72 km/h (45 mph). Power reached the rear wheels via a three speed manual transmission. There was no synchromesh.\u000aAdvertised fuel consumption of 8 litres per 100 km converts into a remarkable 26 MPG (using US gallons) or more than 31 MPG (British gallons). The car quickly gained a reputation for robustness and economy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production ==\u000aThe car was manufactured, just five minutes from the Eiffel Tower, in the 15th arrondissement of central Paris at the famous factory in the Quai de Javel (subsequently renamed Quai André-Citroën), which by 1925 was producing at the rate of 200 cars per day, applying techniques then known as "Taylorism" which André Citroën had studied personally and in depth during a visit to Dearborn that he had undertaken during the war in order to master the techniques being applied by Henry Ford for the production of the Model T.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further developments and the Citroën B10 ==\u000aAt the Paris Motor Show in October 1924 a Citroën 10HP was exhibited with "tout-acier" ("all-steel") body work. Initially this model was offered only with a "Conduite Intérieure" (closed saloon/sedan) body, although a "Torpedo" bodied version was added during the Spring of 1925. For the 1925 model year the "all-steel" bodied car came to be designated as the Citroën B10, while cars with bodies using the (at this stage near universal for passenger cars) coach-builders' approach of constructing car bodies by attaching panels \u2013 often steel panels \u2013 to a stout hand-crafted timber frame continued to be designated as the Citroën B2. As the year progressed, "Type B2" car bodies appeared that incorporated features of the "all-steel" "Type B10" such as the three seater cabriolet that appeared in the summer of 1925 featuring the rounded wings from the steel bodies B10 combined with the fuel filler opening of the earlier cars. This model, along with a subsequent "Coupé De Ville," "Landaulet," and taxi version which featured the same combination, were listed as "Type B2" models while a number of the less mainstream body options were simply delisted. The far from simple cut-off between the B2 and the B10 means that confusion sometimes arises over which are which.\u000aAlthough the "all-steel" bodied B10 could be seen as a replacement for the B2, the chassis and mechanical elements were for the most part interchangeable, and both models were produced in parallel during 1925 and 1926. However, in October 1925 Citroën unveiled another upgrade for their 10HP model, the Citroën B12, which by the end of 1926 had replaced both the B2 and the B10.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Commercial ==\u000aThe all-steel bodied Citroën Type B10 unveiled in late 1924 effectively rewrote the rule-book for auto-making in Europe, even if the extent to which it had changed the economics of the business was not immediately apparent to most competitors. Nevertheless, the importance of the Type B10 sometimes tempts commentators who view history only backwards to overlook the Citroën Type B2.\u000aFor contemporary observers there could be no doubt about the significance of the Citroën Type B2, Europe's second mass-produced car, with 89,841 cars manufactured during a five-year period. The automobile business in France still contained a massively diverse range of companies in what had, till a few years before the outbreak of war, been the world's leading country for automobile production. But in 1925 there was no other manufacturer anywhere in Europe with anything approaching comparable production techniques or the B2's sales volumes with a single model.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Half-track variants ==\u000aThe Half-track cars that gained much media coverage by crossing the Sahara Desert in 1922 were based on the Citroën B2. André Citroën knew the value of publicity, and this was, unsurprisingly, the first crossing of the Sahara by this method.\u000aEight B2 based Half-track cars were also used for the celebrated (at the time) "Croisière noire" (Citroën central Africa expedition), crossing the continent from west to east at a wide point, via Lake Victoria, instigated by André Citroën and led by two adventurers called Georges-Marie Haardt and Louis Audoin-Dubreuil. The expedition took place between 28 October 1924 and 20 June 1925, and was the subject of much talk at the 19th Paris Motor Show in October 1924.\u000aIn 1924 Poland bought 135 complete chassis of the B2 with Kégresse track (known as Citroën-Kegresse B2 10CV). Some were converted to all-terrain lorries while 90 were converted to Samochód pancerny wz. 28 armoured cars.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sources and notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aCitroën B2 sur www.histomobile.com

The US portion of the firm was founded in 1881 in Chicago, by Adolf Kraus and Levy Mayer, and was shortly thereafter known as Kraus, Mayer & Brackett. After several changes in name to reflect its changing membership the firm eventually became known in the US as Mayer, Brown & Platt. The English portion of the firm, Rowe & Maw, was established in 1895 in London and operated under that name until joining with Mayer, Brown & Platt in 2002 to form Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw. In 2007 the amalgamated firm shortened its name to Mayer Brown. Johnson Stokes & Master was formed in 1863 in Hong Kong and is today known as Mayer Brown JSM after merging with Mayer Brown in 2008.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Offices ==\u000aThe firm has offices in Bangkok, Beijing, Brussels, Charlotte, Chicago, Düsseldorf, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong, Houston, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, New York City, Palo Alto, Paris, San Francisco, Shanghai, Singapore, and Washington DC; and, in association with Tauil & Chequer Advogados, offices in Brasília, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Vitória.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Practice Areas ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Banking & Finance ===\u000aAdvises bank holding companies, commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, asset-based lenders, leasing companies, institutional real estate companies, finance companies, funds and investors and borrowers in various industries.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Capital Markets ===\u000aRepresents both issuers and underwriters in a wide variety of debt and equity offerings as well as working at the forefront of the market for securitized products.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Corporate & Securities ===\u000aProvides legal services on transactions including cross-border deals and industry-specific issues.

aVRuxford is an historic estate in the parish of Sandford, near Crediton in Devon.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Pre-Norman Conquest ===\u000aHroces Ford (Ruxford) is recorded in the Anglo Saxon Charters.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Courtenay ===\u000aThe inquisition post mortem dated 8 June 1404 of Thomasia de Raleigh, heiress of Raleigh, Pilton in North Devon and of many other estates, and wife of John Chichester of Donwer, records that "the aforesaid Manor of Rokesford (Ruxford) is held of Philip Courtenay as of his manor of Bradninch by knight-service". This was Philip Courtenay (c.1342-1406) (5th son of Hugh Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon and his wife Margaret Bohun) who had been Steward of the Duchy of Cornwall in Cornwall 1388-1391. The feudal barony of Bradninch, with its member manors including Ruxford, was held before and after Courtenay's brief tenure by the Duchy of Cornwall.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== De Raleigh & Chichester ====\u000aThe estate of Ruxford was held for several generations by the de Raleigh family from the Courtenay family. The eventual heir of de Raleigh was the Chichester family. The de Raleigh family subinfeudated Ruxford to de Sully. The inquisition post mortem of Sir John Chichester (d. 1569) of Raleigh dated 2 January 1569 lists Ruxford as held by him from Queen Elizabeth "as of her Manor of Bradninch", which is the last surviving record of its dependency from the feudal barony of Bradninch.\u000a\u000a\u000a===== Sully =====\u000aEffigies of Sir John de Sully (1282-1388), KG, and his wife Isobel exist in Crediton Parish Church. Sully was lord of the manor of Iddesleigh, but was said by Westcote (d.circa 1637) to have had his seat at "Rookesford, lately the land of Chichester and alienated to Davye", i.e. Ruxford, in the parish of Sandford about 1/2 mile north-west of Crediton. He held Rokysforde from the overlord John de Raleigh of Raleigh in the parish of Pilton, as is evidenced in the latter's deed of 1362 now held in the North Devon Record Office. The heir of John de Raleigh by marriage to his daughter Thomasine was the Chichester family of Raleigh. According to Hoskins the estate of Ruxford is recorded in a charter dated 930 in which a large estate was granted to the canons of Crediton Church. The existing farmhouse known as Ruxford Barton was rebuilt in 1608 by the Chichester family, as is evidenced by a strapwork cartouche in plaster-work displaying the arms of that family with initials and date 1608, in the principal bedroom on the first floor of the parlour wing.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Davie ====\u000aIn 1618 Ruxford Barton was purchased from Sir Robert Chichester, Bart, KB, by Emmanuel Davie, a "clothier of Crediton", a cousin of the Davie family of Creedy, Sandford. The deed of conveyance is summarised as follows:\u000aThe Right Worshipful Sir Robert Chichester of the noble Order of the Bath, Bart, to Emmanuel Davie of Sandford in Crediton, gentleman, whereas \u2026 the Barton Farm, messuage etc called Rokisfoorde or Ruxford, a close of land called Mylum and a parcel of lande a meadow called Nether Apple Meadow in Crediton \u2026 a meadow called Heddge Mead\u2026 now sells the premises with all the messuages, buildings, goods, lands etc, etc, to Emmanuel...".\u000aIn about 1620 a plaster escutcheon was affixed inside the house showing the de Via arms of the Davie family impaled with the arms of Northcote, the arms of the family of his first wife Katherine Northcote (d.1620).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sources ==\u000aMaddock, Michael P.

aVThe division of human rights into three generations was initially proposed in 1979 by the Czech jurist Karel Vasak at the International Institute of Human Rights in Strasbourg. He used the term at least as early as November 1977. Vasak's theories have primarily taken root in European law.\u000aHis divisions follow the three watchwords of the French Revolution: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. The three generations are reflected in some of the rubrics of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes rights that are thought of as second generation as well as first generation ones, but it does not make the distinction in itself (the rights listed are not in specific order).\u000a\u000a\u000a== First-generation human rights ==\u000aFirst-generation human rights, sometimes called "blue" rights, deal essentially with liberty and participation in political life. They are fundamentally civil and political in nature: They serve negatively to protect the individual from excesses of the state. First-generation rights include, among other things, the right to life, equality before the law, freedom of speech, the right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, and voting rights. They were pioneered by the United States Bill of Rights and in France by the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in the 18th century, although some of these rights and the right to due process date back to the Magna Carta of 1215 and the Rights of Englishmen, which were expressed in the English Bill of Rights in 1689.\u000aThey were enshrined at the global level and given status in international law first by Articles 3 to 21 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and later in the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In Europe, they were enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights in 1953.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Second-generation human rights ==\u000aSecond-generation human rights are related to equality and began to be recognized by governments after World War II. They are fundamentally economic, social, and cultural in nature. They guarantee different members of the citizenry equal conditions and treatment. Secondary rights would include a right to be employed in just and favorable condition, rights to food, housing and health care, as well as social security and unemployment benefits. Like first-generation rights, they were also covered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and further embodied in Articles 22 to 28 of the Universal Declaration, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.\u000aIn the United States of America, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed a Second Bill of Rights, covering much the same grounds, during his State of the Union Address on January 11, 1944. Today, many nations, states, or groups of nations have developed legally binding declarations guaranteeing comprehensive sets of human rights, e.g. the European Social Charter.\u000aSome states have enacted some of these economic rights, e.g. the state of New York has enshrined the right to a free education, as well as "the right to organize and to bargain collectively", and workers' compensation, in its constitutional law.\u000aThese rights are sometimes referred to as "red" rights. They impose upon the government the duty to respect and promote and fulfill them, but this depends on the availability of resources. The duty is imposed on the state because it controls its own resources. No one has the direct right to housing and right to education. (In South Africa, for instance, the right is not, per se, to housing, but rather "to have access to adequate housing", realised on a progressive basis.)\u000aThe duty of government is in the realization of these positive rights.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Third-generation human rights ==\u000aThird-generation human rights are those rights that go beyond the mere civil and social, as expressed in many progressive documents of international law, including the 1972 Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and other pieces of generally aspirational "soft law". Because of the present-day tilting toward national sovereignty and the preponderance of would-be offender nations, these rights have been hard to enact in legally binding documents.\u000aThe term "third-generation human rights" remains largely unofficial, just as the also-used moniker of "green" rights, and thus houses an extremely broad spectrum of rights, including:\u000aGroup and collective rights\u000aRight to self-determination\u000aRight to economic and social development\u000aRight to a healthy environment\u000aRight to natural resources\u000aRight to communicate and communication rights\u000aRight to participation in cultural heritage\u000aRights to intergenerational equity and sustainability\u000aThe African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights ensures many of those: right to self-determination, right to development, right to natural resources and right to satisfactory environment. Some countries also have constitutional mechanisms for safeguarding third-generation rights. For example, the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations, the Parliament of Finland's Committee for the Future, and the erstwhile Commission for Future Generations in the Knesset in Israel.\u000aSome international organizations have offices for safeguarding such rights. An example is the High Commissioner on National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Directorate-General for the Environment of the European Commission has as its mission "protecting, preserving and improving the environment for present and future generations, and promoting sustainable development".\u000aA few jurisdictions have enacted provisions for environmental protection, e.g. New York's "forever wild" constitutional article, which is enforceable by action of the New York State Attorney General or by any citizen ex rel. with the consent of the Appellate Division.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Commentary ==\u000aMaurice Cranston argued that scarcity means that supposed second-generation and third-generation rights are not really rights at all. If one person has a right, others have a duty to respect that right, but governments lack the resources necessary to fulfill the duties implied by citizens' supposed second- and third-generation rights.\u000aCharles Kesler, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College and senior fellow of the Claremont Institute, has argued that second- and third-generation human rights serve as an attempt to cloak political goals, which the majority may well agree are good things in and of themselves, in the language of rights, and thus grant those political goals inappropriate connotations. In his opinion, calling socio-economic goods "rights" inherently creates a related concept of "duties", so that other citizens have to be coerced by the government to give things to other people in order to fulfill these new rights. He also has stated that, in the US, the new rights create a "nationalization" of political decision-making at the federal level in violation of federalism. In his book Soft Despotism, Democracy's Drift, Paul Rahe, the Charles O. Lee and Louise K. Lee Chair in Western Heritage at Hillsdale College, wrote that focusing on equality-based rights leads to a subordination to the initial civil rights to an ever-expanding government, which would be too incompetent to provide for its citizens correctly and would merely seek to subordinate more rights.\u000a19th century philosopher Frederic Bastiat summarized the conflict between these negative and positive rights by saying:\u000a\u000aM. de Lamartine wrote me one day: "Your doctrine is only the half of my program; you have stopped at liberty; I go on to fraternity." I answered him: "The second half of your program will destroy the first half." And, in fact, it is quite impossible for me to separate the word "fraternity" from the word "voluntary". It is quite impossible for me to conceive of fraternity as legally enforced, without liberty being legally destroyed, and justice being legally trampled underfoot.\u000a\u000aEconomist F. A. Hayek has argued that the second generation concept of "social justice" cannot have any practical political meaning:\u000a\u000aNo state of affairs as such is just or unjust: it is only when we assume that somebody is responsible for having brought it about ... In the same sense, a spontaneously working market, where prices act as guides to action, cannot take account of what people in any sense need or deserve, because it creates a distribution which nobody has designed, and something which has not been designed, a mere state of affairs as such, cannot be just or unjust. And the idea that things ought to be designed in a "just" manner means, in effect, that we must abandon the market and turn to a planned economy in which somebody decides how much each ought to have, and that means, of course, that we can only have it at the price of the complete abolition of personal liberty.\u000a\u000aNew York University School of Law professor of law Jeremy Waldron has written in response to critics of the second-generation rights:\u000a\u000aIn any case, the argument from first-generation to second-generation rights was never supposed to be a matter of conceptual analysis. It was rather this: if one is really concerned to secure civil or political liberty for a person, that commitment should be accompanied by a further concern about the conditions of the person's life that make it possible for him to enjoy and exercise that liberty. Why on earth would it be worth fighting for this person's liberty (say, his liberty to choose between A and B) if he were left in a situation in which the choice between A and B meant nothing to him, or in which his choosing one rather than the other would have no impact on his life?"\u000a\u000aHungarian socialist and political economist Karl Polanyi made the antithetical argument to Hayek in the book The Great Transformation.

aVModigliani Quartet is a French string quartet founded in Paris in 2003 by four close friends, following their studies at the Conservatoire de Paris.\u000aThey studied with the Ysaÿe Quartet in Paris, attended masterclasses by Walter Levin and György Kurtág in 2004, and had the opportunity to work with the Artemis Quartet at the Universität der Künste in Berlin in 2005. They attracted international attention by winning the Frits Philips String Quartet competition in Eindhoven (2004), the Vittorio Rimbotti competition in Florence (2005) and the Young Concert Artists Auditions in New York (2006).\u000aThe Modigliani Quartet plays in venues like Wigmore Hall, Carnegie Hall, Amsterdam's Concertgebouw, Berlin's Konzerthaus, Brussels's Bozar, Vienna's Musikverein and Konzerthaus, Salzburg's Mozarteum, Théâtre des Champs-Elysées, Cité de la Musique, Lucerne Festival, Schwetzingen Festival, Rheingau Festival, Kissinger Sommer, Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival, Gstaad Menuhin Festival, Schwarzenberg Schubertiade, Washington DC's Library of Congress, Marlboro Festival, Luxemburg's Philharmonie, Zurich's Tonhalle, Munich's Herkulessaal, La Fenice in Venice...\u000aThe quartet regularly plays chamber music with Sabine Meyer, Renaud Capuçon, Nicholas Angelich, Jean-Frédéric Neuburger, Marie-Elisabeth Hecker or Daniel Müller-Schott and various musician friends.\u000aIn 2014, the Modigliani Quartet became Artistic Directors of the Rencontres musicales d'Évian. After a 13-year pause, the festival, made famous by its former legendary artistic director Mstislav Rostropovich, and created in 1976 by Antoine Riboud will start a new life through the joint efforts of the Evian Resort and the Modigliani Quartet.\u000aIn September 2016, Philippe Bernhard left the quartet and was replaced by Amaury Coeytaux, who until then had been the concertmaster of the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France.\u000aThe Modigliani Quartet plays on four Italian instruments: Amaury Coeytaux plays a 1783 violin by Giovanni Battista Guadagnini, Loic Rio plays a 1734 violin by Alessandro Gagliano, Laurent Marfaing plays a 1660 viola by Luigi Mariani, François Kieffer plays a 1706 cello by Matteo Goffriller (former "Warburg") .\u000a\u000a\u000a== Members ==\u000aAmaury Coeytaux, Loïc Rio: violins\u000aLaurent Marfaing: viola\u000aFrançois Kieffer: cello\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discography ==\u000aSchumann-Wolf-Mendelssohn - Nascor, Ysaÿe Records, 2006 (Schumann: quartet op. 41 no. 1 ; Wolf: "Italian Serenade" ; Mendelssohn: quartet op. 44 no. 1)\u000aHaydn - Mirare Records, 2008 (quartets op. 76 no. 4 "Sunrise", op. 74 no. 3 "The rider", op. 54 no. 1)\u000aMendelssohn - Mirare Records, 2010 (quartets in a minor op. 13, in f minor op. 80, Capriccio op. 81 no. 3)\u000aBrahms - Mirare Records, 2011 (piano quintet op. 34 w/ Jean-Frédéric Neuburger, Zwei Gësange op. 91 w/ Andrea Hill)\u000aIntuition - Mirare Records, 2012 (Arriaga: quartet no. 2, Mozart: quartet no. 6 K 159, Schubert: quartet no. 4 D 46)\u000aDebussy-Ravel-Saint-Saëns - Mirare Records, 2013 (Debussy: quartet in g minor, Ravel: quartet in f major, Saint-Saëns: quartet no. 1)\u000aHaydn - Mirare Records, 2014 (quartets op. 50 no. 1, op. 76 no. 1, op. 77 no. 1)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aThe Modigliani Quartet's official website\u000aMirare Records\u000aSolea, Artists Manager

aVThomas Pleydell 'Tommy' Bedford (born 8 February 1942 in Bloemfontein, South Africa) is a South African rugby union player who has represented the national team, the Springboks, 25 times, captaining the Springboks on 3 occasions.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aTommy Bedford won the first of his 25 caps against Australia as a flank forward on 13 July 1963. Though he appeared as a 21-year-old flank forward in six Test matches, it was the number 8 position that established him as a player of outstanding quality on the international scene.\u000aA very athletic and dynamic number 8 he formed a remarkably efficient and complementary back-row partnership with Jan Ellis and Piet Greyling. He made his debut against the Lions in an historic Test at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria - the first ever international in which replacements were allowed for injury, though no more than four players per team could be replaced in a match at the time. He played number 8 in all four Tests against the 1968 Lions with South Africa winning the tightly-fought series 3-0, with one drawn, when in both the first and third Tests the winning margin was only five points. The young Durban architect, who captained his provincial team Natal, also led his country three times, against Australia (twice) and Scotland on the 1969 tour to Britain and Ireland.\u000aDespite his prowess as a player and captain, it is thought that his relentless and uncompromising criticism of the apartheid system and the rugby establishment contributed to a premature end of his playing career. He retired from international rugby after the drawn Test with France in Durban in 1971.\u000aProfessionally, he was an architect who, in 1965, was elected a Rhodes scholar.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes and references ==

aVBenedict Joseph Flaget  (November 7, 1763 \u2013 February 11, 1850) was a French-born Catholic bishop in the United States. He served as the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bardstown between 1808 and 1839. When the see was transferred to Louisville in 1839, he became Bishop of the Diocese of Louisville where he served from 1839 to 1850.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Education and call to ministry ==\u000aFlaget was born on November 7, 1763 in Contournat, now part of the commune of Saint-Julien-de-Coppel, in the ancient Province of Auvergne in the center of the Kingdom of France. Orphaned at an early age, he and his siblings were raised by his maternal aunt, assisted by his paternal uncle, a canon at the collegiate church of Billom. At the age of 17 he entered the Society of Saint-Sulpice at Clermont-Ferrand. He was ordained a priest on June 1, 1788. Flaget then taught theology for two years at the University of Nantes, and soon held the same post at the seminary at Angers, until those institutions were closed by the French Revolution.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early church work in America ==\u000aIn January 1792 Flaget sailed from Bordeaux, accompanied by fellow Sulpician John Baptist Mary David, and the then secular deacon Stephen Badin whose studies for the priesthood had been interrupted by the Revolution. They reached Philadelphia on March 26 and proceeded to Baltimore, arriving on March 29. After only two months in America, the Bishop of Baltimore, John Carroll, sent him to Fort Vincennes in the Indiana Territory to staff the Church of St. Francis Xavier, founded by Jesuit missionaries in 1748, before their Suppression and expulsion by British forces in 1763. There was a considerable number of French settlers and the mission which had gone without the presence of a resident priest for decades.\u000aFlaget journeyed west in a wagon headed through the Allegheny Mountains to Fort Pitt, the area now known as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A letter of introduction from Bishop Carroll provided an introduction to General "Mad" Anthony Wayne. Travel was to be by flatboat down the Ohio River, but due to low water conditions he stayed at Fort Pitt for a few months. While there he learned English and tended to those afflicted by an outbreak of smallpox in the area. Flaget left Pittsburgh in November and traveled down the Ohio River to the Falls of the Ohio (Louisville), where he continued on his journey to Fort Vincennes with George Rogers Clark. They reached the fort on December 21, 1792.\u000aAt Vincennes, in addition to his pastoral work, Flaget founded a school and library in the church (now the Old Cathedral and Library), the oldest educational institutions in Indiana. At Vincennes he ministered to the Catholics at the small parish. Here also he nursed the sick when in 1793 smallpox broke out among the settlers and the nearby Miami tribe. Flaget himself became ill, but recovered.\u000aFlaget was recalled by his superiors to Baltimore and on April 23, 1795 traveled to Kaskaskia and then down the river to New Orleans and from there sailed to Baltimore. He taught geography and French at Georgetown College for the next three years. One of his students was the future bishop of Boston, Benedict Joseph Fenwick.\u000aFlaget left Baltimore with two colleagues in 1798 bound for Cuba as part of a Sulpician mission to establish a college on that island. They were met with opposition from the local diocesan administrators, however, and were not able to celebrate Mass in Havana. During that stay, he contracted yellow fever and was left behind when the other Sulpicians decided to return to the United States. He recovered and acted as a tutor to the son of a wealthy Spaniard. Later, after the death of the Archbishop of Havana, the Dean of he Cathedral granted him permission to celebrate Mass at the church of the Capuchin friars. Flaget learned Spanish during his stay. While he was in Cuba, Louis Phillippe of France and his two brothers had arrived there on their journey in exile. The refugee aristocrats were befriended by their fellow Frenchman, Flaget, in 1800. This was a kindness which Louis Phillippe remembered and returned when he later ascended the throne of France as King.\u000aFlaget returned to Baltimore in November 1801. He brought with him 23 young Spaniards whom he had recruited to study at Georgetown College. He then spent the next several years in various posts at that school.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bishop ==\u000aFlaget was appointed by the Holy See as the first Bishop of the newly established Diocese of Bardstown on April 8, 1808. This was the largest diocese ever formed in the United States and comprised an area now covering 10 modern states, including Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Michigan, Indiana and others. Today this area includes 35 dioceses. Flaget, however, vigorously opposed the appointment and traveled to France in an effort to have it reversed. He was unsuccessful in this effort.\u000aOn his return trip to the United States, Flaget brought other early Sulpician missionaries to America: Simon Bruté, Guy Ignatius Chabrat, Anthony Deydier, James Derigaud and Julian Romeuf. The first two also became bishops in America. Upon his arrival, Flaget was consecrated a bishop by now-Archbishop Carroll on November 4, 1810.\u000aUpon taking office the following year, Flaget found himself charged with the pastoral care of the western frontier of the United States, having the assistance of seven priests. He went on to build St. Joseph Cathedral in Bardstown as the center of the diocese and a seminary to train the clergy needed to carry out the work of the diocese. He was one of only two bishops of Bardstown (along with John Baptist Mary David), though, since the diocese was removed to Louisville, Bardstown remained a titular see.\u000aBy 1817 Flaget was able to supply clergy to care for the French and Native American peoples living around the Great Lakes. He also began to establish parishes in Indiana and Michigan. In 1819 he proposed to the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (which oversaw the American Church as a missionary territory) the subdivision of his diocese. Eventually the diocese was subdivided, the first division becoming the Diocese of Cincinnati. Flaget was the principal consecrator of that new diocese's first bishop, Edward Dominic Fenwick, O.P. His counsel was also sought by the Congregation in international matters, such as resolving a dispute between the Canadian Sulpicians and the Archbishop of Quebec.\u000aFlaget attended the First Provincial Council held by the American bishops in Baltimore to organize the Catholic Church as it was beginning to establish itself in the new nation. Worn out by this and his other labors, due to his poor health he submitted his resignation as bishop, which was accepted effective May 7, 1832. The outcry at this was so great from both the clergy and laity of the diocese, however, that he was appointed to that post again on March 17, 1833. The Bardstown Diocese was later transferred to Louisville, Kentucky on February 13, 1841, becoming the Diocese of Louisville.\u000aDuring a cholera outbreak in 1833, Flaget's care for the afflicted of all classes and creeds elicited general admiration from the public. In 1834 he received a new coadjutor bishop in the person of Guy Ignatius Chabrat, S.S., whom Flaget himself had recruited from a Sulpician seminary in France in 1811 and then ordained. The following year, Flaget left for Europe, where he stayed until 1839. By the time of his departure, he had erected four colleges, a large female orphanage and infirmary, eleven academies for girls, and had introduced three congregations of Religious Sisters and four religious Orders of men. After his return, he helped the Trappists to establish their first successful monastery in the nation in his diocese.\u000aChabret resigned as Coadjutor in 1847, and Flaget himself became confined to his bed for the last years of his life. He died February 11, 1850, and was buried two days later, after a Requiem Mass celebrated by his new Coadjutor Bishop, Martin John Spalding, with the sermon given by Bishop Purcell. He was buried in the undercroft of the Cathedral of the Assumption in Louisville, Kentucky.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Legacy ==\u000aSeveral institutions have been named for Benedict Joseph Flaget:\u000aBishop Flaget School \u2013 Chillicothe, Ohio\u000aFlaget Memorial Hospital \u2013 Bardstown, Kentucky\u000aFlaget Elementary School \u2013 Vincennes, Indiana\u000aFlaget Center (Senior Center) \u2013 Louisville, Kentucky\u000aFlaget Community Center \u2013 Louisville, Kentucky\u000aKnights of Columbus, Flaget Council \u2013 Chillicothe, Ohio\u000aBishop Flaget High School \u2013 Louisville, Kentucky (now closed)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000aCathedrals in the Wilderness, J.

aVGertrud Rask (1673 \u2013 21 December 1735) was the first wife of the Danish-Norwegian missionary to Greenland Hans Egede and was the mother of the missionary and translator Paul Egede.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life in Norway ==\u000aGertrud Rask (the parish register records her as Gjertrud Nilsdatter Rasch) was born at Kvæøya, Troms, Norway, the third of six children of Niels Nielsen Rasch (1641\u20131704) and Nille Nilsdatter (d. 1716). Growing up in the harsh climate of northern Norway, she was 34 when she married Hans Egede, the 21-year-old pastor of Vågan in the Lofoten archipelago. They had four children - Poul (1709\u20131789), Niels (1710\u20131782), Kirstine Matthea (1715\u20131786) and Petronelle (1716\u20131805).\u000aHer husband's determination to establish a Greenland mission had become firm by 1710 at the latest; Gertrud Rask Egede strongly resisted his plan initially, but eventually she bent to his will after he promised not to go to Greenland without her.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Mission to Greenland ==\u000aIn 1718, the couple and their children moved to Bergen, whence \u2013 at the conclusion of the Great Northern War \u2013 they set sail for Greenland on 12 May 1721, arriving at Baal's River (the modern Nuup Kangerlua) on the southwest coast on 3 July. Hope Colony (Haabets Koloni) was established on Kangeq Island at the mouth of the fjord; the remains of the house where the family lived together with (initially) about 25 other people are still preserved. The settlement was moved to the mainland and renamed Godthaab by the royal governor Claus Paarss in 1728.\u000aDespite her strong Pietist bias, Gertrud supported her husband's missionary work among the Inuit, working among them as a nurse. In 1733, the Moravian missionaries Christian Stach, Matthias Stach, and Christian David arrived and began the settlement that would become first New Herrnhut and then Nuuk. Also with them, however, was one of Hans Egede's child converts who had been sent to Denmark to participate in the festivities around the coronation of Christian VI: the child had contracted smallpox and spread the disease to the defenseless Inuit, thousands of whom died over the next two years. Gertrud Egede worked among them, but finally succumbed herself in 1735.\u000aIn 1736, her husband left the island in the care of his son Poul and returned her body to Denmark for burial at the St. Nikolai Church in Copenhagen (now Kunsthallen Nikolaj) where Egede himself was buried upon his death in 1758.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Legacy ==\u000aRoads in both Greenland and Denmark, a church in Qaqortoq (then known as Julianehåb), a children's home and a restaurant in Nuuk have all been named after Gertrud Rask.\u000aAn icebreaking steamship, the Gertrude Rask, was launched in Nakskov, Denmark in 1923. The 47-metre ship was used for Greenlandic trade and for several exploration trips from Copenhagen to Greenland, but sank off Nova Scotia in 1942.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==

aVErin Brockovich (born June 22, 1960) is an American legal clerk and environmental activist, who, despite her lack of formal education in the law, was instrumental in building a case against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) of California in 1993. Her successful lawsuit was the subject of a 2000 film, Erin Brockovich, which starred Julia Roberts. Since then, Brockovich has become a media personality as well, hosting the TV series Challenge America with Erin Brockovich on ABC and Final Justice on Zone Reality. She is the president of Brockovich Research & Consulting. She also works as a consultant for Girardi & Keese, the New York law firm of Weitz & Luxenberg, which has a focus on personal injury claims for asbestos exposure, and Shine Lawyers in Australia.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aShe was born Erin Pattee in Lawrence, Kansas, the daughter of Betty Jo (née O'Neal; 1923\u20132008), a journalist, and Frank Pattee (1924\u20132011), an industrial engineer and football player. She has two brothers, Frank Jr. and Thomas (1954\u20131992), and a sister, Jodie. She graduated from Lawrence High School, then attended Kansas State University, in Manhattan, Kansas, and graduated with an Associate in Applied Arts Degree from Wade College in Dallas, Texas. She worked as a management trainee for Kmart in 1981 but quit after a few months and entered a beauty pageant. She won Miss Pacific Coast in 1981 and left the beauty pageant after the win. She has lived in California since 1982.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Pacific Gas and Electric litigation ==\u000a\u000aThe case alleged contamination of drinking water with hexavalent chromium (also written as "chromium VI", "Cr-VI" or "Cr-6") in the southern California town of Hinkley. At the center of the case was a facility, the Hinkley compressor station, built in 1952 as a part of a natural-gas pipeline connecting to the San Francisco Bay Area. Between 1952 and 1966, PG&E used hexavalent chromium in a cooling tower system to fight corrosion. The wastewater was discharged to unlined ponds at the site, and some percolated into the groundwater, affecting an area near the plant approximately 2 by 1 mile (3.2 by 1.6 km). The Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) put the PG&E site under its regulations in 1968.\u000aThe case was settled in 1996 for US$333 million, the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit in U.S. history. Masry & Vititoe, the law firm for which Brockovich was a legal clerk, received $133.6 million of that settlement, and Brockovich herself was given a bonus of $2.5 million.\u000aA study released in 2010 by the California Cancer Registry showed that cancer rates in Hinkley "remained unremarkable from 1988 to 2008". An epidemiologist involved in the study said that the 196 cases of cancer reported during the most recent survey of 1996 through 2008 were fewer than what he would expect based on demographics and the regional rate of cancer. However, a June 2013 Mother Jones magazine article featured an extensive critique from the Center for Public Integrity of the author's work on the later epidemiological studies.\u000aAs of 2016, average Cr-6 levels in Hinkley were recorded as 1.19 ppb with a peak of 3.09 ppb. For comparison, the PG&E Topock Compressor Station on the California-Arizona border averaged 7.8 ppb with peaks of 31.8 ppb based on a PG&E Background Study.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other litigation ==\u000aWorking with Edward L. Masry, a lawyer based in Thousand Oaks, California, Brockovich went on to participate in other anti-pollution lawsuits. One suit accused the Whitman Corporation of chromium contamination in Willits, California. Another, which listed 1,200 plaintiffs, alleged contamination near PG&E's Kettleman Hills compressor station in Kings County, California, along the same pipeline as the Hinkley site. The Kettleman suit was settled for $335 million in 2006.\u000aIn 2003, Brockovich received settlements of $430,000 from two parties and an undisclosed amount from a third party to settle her lawsuit alleging toxic mold in her Agoura Hills, California, home. After experiencing problems with mold contamination in her own home in the Conejo Valley, Brockovich became a prominent activist and educator in this area as well.\u000aBrockovich and Masry filed suit against the Beverly Hills Unified School District in 2003, in which the district was accused of harming the health and safety of its students by allowing a contractor to operate a cluster of oil wells on campus. Brockovich and Masry alleged that 300 cancer cases were linked to the oil wells. Subsequent testing and epidemiological investigation failed to corroborate a substantial link, and Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Wendell Mortimer granted summary judgment against the plaintiffs. In May 2007, the School District announced that it was to be paid $450,000 as reimbursement for legal expenses.\u000aBrockovich assisted in the filing of a lawsuit against Prime Tanning Corp. of St. Joseph, Missouri, in April 2009. The lawsuit claims that waste sludge from the production of leather, containing high levels of hexavalent chromium, was distributed to farmers in northwest Missouri to use as fertilizer on their fields. It is believed to be a potential cause of an abnormally high number of brain tumors (70 since 1996) around the town of Cameron, Missouri, which is currently being investigated by the EPA.\u000aIn June 2009, Brockovich began investigating a case of contaminated water in Midland, Texas. "Significant amounts" of hexavalent chromium were found in the water of more than 40 homes in the area, some of which have now been fitted with state-monitored filters on their water supply. Brockovich said "The only difference between here and Hinkley is that I saw higher levels here than I saw in Hinkley."\u000a\u000aIn 2012, Brockovich got involved in the mysterious case of 14 students from LeRoy, New York, who began reporting perplexing medical symptoms including tics and speech difficulty. Brockovich believed environmental pollution from the 1970 Lehigh Valley Railroad derailment was the cause and conducted testing in the area. Brockovich was supposed to return to town to present her findings, but never did; in the meantime the students' doctors determined the cause was mass psychogenic illness and that the media exposure was making it worse. No environmental causes were found after repeat testing and the students improved once the media attention died down. In early 2016, Brockovich became involved in potential litigation against Southern California Gas for a large methane leak from its underground storage facility near the community of Porter Ranch north of Los Angeles (see Aliso Canyon gas leak).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Awards ==\u000aHonorary Doctor of laws and commencement speaker at Lewis & Clark Law School, Portland, Oregon, in May 2005.\u000aHonorary Doctor of Humane Letters and commencement speaker at Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles, on May 5, 2007.\u000aHonorary Master of Arts, Business Communication, from Jones International University, Centennial, Colorado.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Movies ==\u000aBrockovich's work in bringing litigation against Pacific Gas and Electric was the focus of the 2000 feature film, Erin Brockovich, starring Julia Roberts in the title role. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Writing in a Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Roberts won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Erin Brockovich. Erin Brockovich herself had a cameo role as a waitress named Julia R.\u000aBrockovich had a more extensive role in the 2012 documentary Last Call at the Oasis, which focused on not only water pollution but also the overall state of water scarcity as it relates to water policy in the United States.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Book ==\u000aBrockovich's book, titled Take It From Me: Life's a Struggle But You Can Win, (ISBN 978-0071383790) was published in 2001.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial Site of Erin Brockovich\u000aThe Brockovich Report BrockovichBlog.com\u000aBrockovich I-Village\u000aOfficial MySpace of Erin Brockovich\u000aErin Brockovich biography on the Biography Channel\u000aErin Brockovich on IMDb\u000aEvening with Erin Brockovich in Sydney, hosted by the Climate Change Coalition 2007\u000aDetail about Hinkley case at AwesomeStories.com\u000aDid Hinkley Residents Really Win? at salon.com\u000aWeitz & Luxenberg PC\u000aShine Lawyers Australia\u000aEnvironmental Justice Society\u000aErin Brockovich video produced by Makers: Women Who Make America

aVLake Maninjau (Indonesian: Danau Maninjau, meaning overlook or observation in the Minangkabau language) is a caldera lake in West Sumatra, Indonesia. It is located 36 km to the west of Bukittinggi, at 0°19\u2032S 100°12\u2032E.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Formation ==\u000aThe Maninjau caldera was formed by a volcanic eruption estimated to have occurred around 52,000 years ago. Deposits from the eruption have been found in a radial distribution around Maninjau extending up to 50 km to the east, 75 km to the southeast, and west to the present coastline. The deposits are estimated to be distributed over 8500 km² and have a volume of 220\u2013250 km³. The caldera has a length of 20 km and a width of 8 km.\u000a\u000a\u000a== The lake ==\u000aLake Maninjau has an area of 99.5 km², being approximately 16 km long and 7 km wide. The average depth is 105 m, with a maximum depth of 165 m. The natural outlet for excess water is the Antokan river, located on the west side of the lake. It is the only lake in Sumatra which has a natural outlet to the west coast. Since 1983 this water has been used to generate hydroelectric power for West Sumatra, generated around 68 MW at maximum load.\u000aMost of the people who live around Lake Maninjau are ethnically Minangkabau. Villages on the shores of the lake include Maninjau and Bayur.\u000aManinjau is a notable tourist destination in the region due to its scenic beauty and mild climate.

One method of preparing palai rinuak is to grill a mixture of the fish along with coconut and spices, wrapped in a banana leaf.\u000aThe lake is used for aquaculture, using karamba floating net cages. The technique was introduced in 1992, and by 1997 there were over 2,000 cage units with over 600 households engaged. Each cage may have 3-4 production cycles each year. There is evidence of pollution around some karamba area.\u000aOn the edge of the lake, the landuse includes rice fields in the swamps and the lower slopes. The villages are bordered uphill by a large belt of forestlike tree gardens, which dissolves into the upper montane forest on the steepest parts of the slopes up to the ridge of the caldera.\u000aThe tree gardens include three typical components:\u000aFruit trees including durian, jack fruit, cempedak, rambutan, langsat, golden berries and water apples.\u000aTimber species including Toona sinensis and Pterospermum javanicum.\u000aSpice trees including cinnamon, coffee, nutmeg and cardamum.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sukarno's pantun ==\u000a\u000aThe first president of Indonesia, Sukarno, visited the area in early June 1948.

aVThe Piper PA-38-112 Tomahawk is a two-seat, fixed tricycle gear general aviation airplane, originally designed for flight training, touring and personal use.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Design and development ==\u000aThe Tomahawk is a single-engined low-wing cantilever monoplane with a T-tail and an enclosed cabin for two. It has a fixed tricycle landing gear and is powered by a Lycoming O-235 four-cylinder piston engine with a twin-bladed tractor propeller. The Tomahawk has two front-hinged doors for access to the cabin.\u000aThe Tomahawk was Piper's attempt at creating an affordable two-place trainer. Before designing the aircraft, Piper widely surveyed flight instructors for their input into the design. Instructors requested a more spinnable aircraft for training purposes, since other two-place trainers such as the Cessna 150 and 152 were designed to spontaneously fly out of a spin. The Tomahawk's NASA GA(W)-1 Whitcomb airfoil addresses this requirement by making specific pilot input necessary in recovering from spins, thus allowing pilots to develop proficiency in dealing with spin recovery.\u000a\u000aThe Tomahawk was introduced in 1977 as a 1978 model. The aircraft was in continuous production until 1982 when production was completed, with 2,484 aircraft built.\u000aThe 1981 and 1982 models were designated as the Tomahawk II. They incorporated improved cabin heating and windshield defroster performance, an improved elevator trim system, improved engine thrust vector, 100% airframe zinc-chromate anti-corrosion treatment, better cockpit soundproofing, larger 6" wheels and tires for greater propeller ground clearance and improved performance on grass and dirt runways, among other enhancements.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Safety record ===\u000a\u000aAccording to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Air Safety Foundation, which published a Safety Highlight report on the Piper Tomahawk, the Piper Tomahawk has a one-third lower accident rate per flying hour than the comparable Cessna 150/152 series of two-place benchmark trainers. The Tomahawk has a higher rate of fatal spin accidents per flying hour. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) estimated that the Tomahawk's stall/spin accident rate was three to five times that of the Cessna 150/152.\u000aAccording to the NTSB, the Tomahawk's wing design was modified after FAA certification tests, but was not retested. Changes included reducing the number of full wing ribs and cutting lightening holes in the main spar. The aircraft's engineers told the NTSB that the changes made to the design resulted in a wing that was soft and flexible, allowing its shape to become distorted and possibly causing unpredictable behavior in stalls and spins. The design engineers said that the GAW-1 airfoil required a rigid structure because it was especially sensitive to airfoil shape, and that use of a flexible surface with that airfoil would make the Tomahawk wing "a new and unknown commodity in stalls and spins."\u000aAirworthiness Directive 83-14-08 issued in September 1983 mandated an additional pair of stall strips to be added to the inboard leading edge of the PA-38 wing to "standardize and improve the stall characteristics".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Specifications (PA-38-112 Tomahawk II) ==\u000a\u000aData from Janes's All The World's Aircraft 1982\u201383\u000aGeneral characteristics\u000aCrew: one\u000aCapacity: one passenger\u000aLength: 23 ft 1¼ in (7.04 m)\u000aWingspan: 34 ft 0 in (10.36 m)\u000aHeight: 9 ft 0¾ in (2.76 m)\u000aWing area: 124.7 ft² (11.59 m²)\u000aAirfoil: NASA GA(W)-1\u000aEmpty weight: 1,128 lb (512 kg)\u000aMax. takeoff weight: 1,670 lb (757 kg)\u000aPowerplant: 1 × Avco Lycoming O-235-L2C air-cooled flat-four piston engine, 112 hp (83.5 kW)\u000aPerformance\u000aNever exceed speed: 159 mph (138 knots, 256 km/h)\u000aMaximum speed: 126 mph (109 knots, 202 km/h) at sea level\u000aCruise speed: 115 mph (100 knots, 185 km/h) at 10,500 ft (3,200 m) (65% power)\u000aStall speed: 56.5 mph (49 knots, 91 km/h) (IAS), flaps down\u000aRange: 539 miles (468 nmi, 867 km) at 10,500 ft (3,200 m), (65% power)\u000aService ceiling: 13,000 ft (4,000 m)\u000aRate of climb: 718 ft/min (3.65 m/s)\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aAircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\u000aAerotec A-132 Tangará\u000aAlpha 2000 (Robin R2000)\u000aBeechcraft Skipper\u000aCessna 150\u000aCessna 152\u000aDiamond DA20\u000aGrumman American AA-1\u000aLiberty XL2\u000aSymphony SA-160\u000aWhitney Boomerang\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sources ==\u000aTaylor, John W.R.

aVThe National Theatre (Czech: Národní divadlo) in Prague is known as the alma mater of Czech opera, and as the national monument of Czech history and art.\u000aThe National Theatre belongs to the most important Czech cultural institutions, with a rich artistic tradition, which helped to preserve and develop the most important features of the nation\u2013the Czech language and a sense for a Czech musical and dramatic way of thinking.\u000aToday the National Theatre consists of three artistic ensembles: opera, ballet and drama. They alternate in their performances in the historic building of the National Theatre, in the Theatre of the Estates and in the Kolowrat Theatre. All three artistic ensembles select their repertoire both from classical heritage, and modern authors.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Initial design and construction, 1844 to 1881 ==\u000a\u000aThe cornerstone of the National Theatre was laid on 16 May 1868, but the idea of building a theatre dates back to the autumn of 1844 at the gatherings of patriots in Prague. An application was submitted by Franti\u0161ek Palacký to the Provincial Committee of the Czech Assembly on 29 January 1845, requesting "the privilege of constructing, furnishing, maintaining and managing" of an independent Czech theatre. The application was granted in April 1845, but it was not until six years later \u2013 in April 1851 \u2013 that the founding Society for the Establishment of a Czech National Theatre in Prague made the first public appeal to start a collection. A year later the proceeds went toward the purchase of land belonging to a former salt works covering an area of not quite 28 acres (11 ha) which determined the magnificent site of the theatre on the banks of the river Vltava facing the panorama of Prague Castle, but at the same time the cramped area and trapezium shape posed challenging problems for the designers of the building.\u000a\u000aThe era of von Bach absolutism brought to a halt preparations for the envisaged theatre and supported the concept of a modest provisional building, which was erected on the south side of the theatre parcel by architect Vojt\u011bch Ignác Ullmann and opened on 18 November 1862. The building of the Provisional Theatre then became a constituent part of the final version of the National Theatre; its outside cladding is visible to this day in the elevated section of the rear part of the building, and the interior layout was only obliterated following the latest reconstruction of the National Theatre in 1977 \u2013 1983. Simultaneously with the realization of this minimal programme asserted by F.L. Rieger and the Provincial Committee, the young progressive advocates of the original ambitious concept of the building (Sladkovský, Tyr\u0161, Neruda, Hálek) launched an offensive. In 1865 these men attained leading positions in the Society and requested the 33-year-old professor of civil engineering at the Prague Technical College, architect Josef Zítek, to draft a design for the National Theatre. He then came out on top in a later-declared open competition, and in 1867 construction work began. On 16 May 1868, the foundation stone was laid, and in November the foundations were completed. In 1875, the new building reached its full height and in 1877 the theatre was roofed over. As of 1873 there was an ongoing competition for the interior decoration of the building, the scenario of which had been elaborated by a special commission under the leadership of Sladkovský. On the one hand, the themes were in the spirit of the Neo-Renaissance concept of a classic building. On the other hand, they were inspired by the current enthusiasm for Slavonic mythology and the stories of the Manuscripts; both of these concepts were based on Josef Mánes' paintings and connected with the contemporary style of romantic landscape painting (also linked to Czech history). They provided the fundamental ideology guiding artistic expression, which today is described as the art of the generation of the National Theatre.\u000aThe theatre includes a triga (a three-horse quadriga) and 10 exterior allegorical sculptures by Bohuslav Schnirch, 10 more exterior pieces by Antonín Wagner, the stone pieces by Max Verich and an interior sculpted pediment group over the proscenium arch by Schnirch.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Grand opening ===\u000aThe National Theatre was opened for the first time on 11 June 1881, to honour the visit of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria. Bed\u0159ich Smetana's opera Libu\u0161e was given its world premiere, conducted by Adolf \u010cech. Another 11 performances were presented after that. Then the theatre was closed down to enable the completion of the finishing touches. While this work was under way a fire broke out on 12 August 1881, which destroyed the copper dome, the auditorium and the stage of the theatre.\u000aThe fire was seen as a national catastrophe and was met with a mighty wave of determination to take up a new collection: Within 47 days a million guldens were collected. This national enthusiasm, however, did not correspond to the behind-the-scenes battles that flared up following the catastrophe. Architect Josef Zítek was no longer in the running, and his pupil architect Josef Schulz was summoned to work on the reconstruction. He was the one to assert the expansion of the edifice to include the block of flats belonging to Dr. Polák that was situated behind the building of the Provisional Theatre. He made this building a part of the National Theatre and simultaneously changed somewhat the area of the auditorium to improve visibility. He did, however, take into account with utmost sensitivity the style of Zítek's design, and so he managed to merge three buildings by various architects to form an absolute unity of style.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reconstruction and reopening, 1883 to 1977 ==\u000a\u000aThe interior artwork was done by Mikolá\u0161 Ale\u0161 and Franti\u0161ek \u017dení\u0161ek. The building of the National Theatre was inaugurated on 18 November 1883. The building, with perfect technical equipment (electric illumination, a steel-constructed stage), served without any extensive modifications for almost one hundred years. It was only on 1 April 1977, following a performance of the Lantern by Jirásek, that the theatre was closed down for six years.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Additional reconstruction, 1977 to 1983 and after ==\u000aArchitect Zden\u011bk Vávra was appointed to take charge of the overall reconstruction work. This extensive project was combined with the completion of work on the entire setting of the theatre. The work was completed to meet an important deadline, which was the date of the 100th anniversary of the opening of the National Theatre: 18 November 1983. On that day the theatre was handed over to the public again with a performance of Smetana\u2019s Libu\u0161e.\u000aThe historic building, noted for its beautiful architecture, also includes an annex of modern design which contains offices and the main box office. Today it functions as the main stage of the three artistic ensembles of the National Theatre: drama, opera and ballet.\u000aIn 1989 the general director of the National Theatre, composer Ji\u0159í Pauer was dismissed from his post because of his support for the policies of the former Communist Czechoslovak government. Pauer locked all staff out of the National and Smetana theatres on 17 November 1989 to prevent members of the opera, ballet and drama companies from staging protest performances. After a three-week strike Pauer was replaced by Ivo \u017dídek.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Management ==\u000aThe National Theatre is overseen by the director, and the advisory body of the Council of the National Theatre. The advisory board has 11 to 13 members, who are appointed and dismissed by the director. Current members of the council include: JUDr. Pavel Smutný, Prof. Dr. Dadja Altenburg Pe\u0161ta Kohl, Ing. Petr Dvo\u0159ák, Ing. Ji\u0159í Mace\u0161ka, JUDr. Vlasta Formánková, Ing. Bohdan Wojnar, Prof. Ing. Ji\u0159í Draho\u0161, DrSc., dr.h.c., Pavel Kohout, Ing. Old\u0159ich \u010cernoch CSc. and Ing. Peter Pale\u010dka. \u000a\u000a\u000a== Komer\u010dní banka Award ==\u000aOn 4 May 2005, Komer\u010dní banka signed an agreement with the National Theatre in Prague to annually honor the most prominent acts performed at the Czech National Theatre in overall three categories \u2013 ballet, drama and opera. The recipients of the KOBANADI Award (KOBANADI = KOmer\u010dní BAnka + NArodní DIvadlo) receive a statuette designed by the academic Jaroslav Róna, 100,000 Czech koruna (approx. \u20ac4,000 as of March 2011).

aVPerkasie is a borough in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, 35 miles (56 km) north of Philadelphia. Establishments in the borough early in the twentieth century included silk mills, baseballs, brickyards, lumber mills, tile works, a stone crusher, and manufacturies of cigars, tags and labels, wire novelties, etc. The population in 1900 was 1,803; in 1910, 2,779 people lived in Perkasie. The population was 8,511 at the 2010 census.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aBoth the town of Perkasie and Pocasie Creek derive their name from the Lenape Unami phrase Pèhpahkàsink/Poekskossing which translates to "One who goes to the place to crack nuts" Or " one who cracks nuts there". Pahkàsink/Pokesing means "a place to crack nuts". Lastly, Pahkàsi/Pocasie means "to crack nuts". The Dutch/Swedish (before the British settlements) pronounced the word with an r and it stuck. Sink sounded a lot like sing which translates to place or area. There was doubtless a village on the site of the present town before William Penn\u2019s Perkasie Manor was settled." "The "Manor" of Perkasie was one of several in Bucks County and contained 11,462 acres (4,639 ha). Laid out and surveyed in 1708 it embraced most of Hilltown and Rockhill Township."\u000aOn June 8, 1890, a disastrous fire began at the livery stable located at 7th and Chestnut Streets; twelve buildings were destroyed. Personal buckets and ladders were used to extinguish the fire. Less than a month later, on July 4, 1890, a committee appointed by Perkasie Borough Council met to form the Hope Fire Company. On September 8, 1890, the Hope Fire Company met at Groover's Hall (517 Chestnut Street) and adopted a constitution and by-laws; 32 members were present.\u000aAt the same time, Borough Council turned over to the fire company a hand pumper purchased from Newtown Fire Association, and a hose cart purchased from Philadelphia with 800 feet (240 m) of hose. One month later the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad presented the Fire Company with a tire for a steam locomotive driver wheel for use as a fire alarm. This was installed in a cupola of the Groover building (now in front of Silverdale Fire Company).\u000aBetween 1920 and 1950, a factory at 815 Chestnut Street in Perkasie produced millions of major-league baseballs through the Hubbert/Spalding contract. The building was subsequently converted into the Senior Citizens Center, which has since moved to the neighboring borough of Silverdale. It is now scheduled to be converted to six two-bedroom condominiums by Habitat for Humanity of Bucks County, to provide a new start for families in need. The organization plans to utilize green building techniques while preserving the building's historical exterior.\u000aThe Pearl S. Buck House at Green Hills Farm, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, is located near Perkasie in Hilltown Twp..\u000aOn June 26, 1988, about 15 percent of the town, including many historic buildings, were burned down in what became known as The Great Perkasie Fire. This massive fire was started by two 12-year-old boys who were playing with a lighter near the coal bins behind the Shelley & Sons lumberyard at Seventh and Market Streets. The fire was fought by about 300 firefighters who came from over 50 fire companies in three counties. Among the historic buildings lost were the American House and the Moyer-Kantner Funeral Home, both dating from 1870; the Herstine Building; and the J.G. Moyer building. The latter was photographed for the cover of the July 7, 1945 edition of The Saturday Evening Post, an artistic rendition of a Fourth of July parade by John Falter. Despite the size of the fire, no fatalities were reported.\u000aImmediately after the fire, a group of concerned business owners, residents and borough officials formed a Downtown Restoration Task Force. The Task Force was given the name of the Perkasie Towne Improvement Association (PTIA). This group was the forerunner to the Perkasie Olde Towne Association. The PTIA along with Perkasie's local government were responsible for the three-phase town improvement plan that was completed over the next five intervening years. The PTIA's focus was to oversee the reconstruction of not only the area of the town center affected by the fire, but also other retail and residential areas in the central part of the Borough. As a result of these efforts, streetscape enhancements of decorative street lights, underground utilities, new sidewalks with decorative brick borders were built and new benches, trash receptacles and street trees were placed throughout the focus area.\u000aThe South Perkasie Covered Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Geography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Climate ===\u000aPerkasie is in the humid continental climate zone. Mean winter temperatures are in the 20s F, with record winter highs only in the 50s. The all-time record low was -23F in 1994. The all-time record high was 102F in July, 2011. Average highs range from 38F in January to 85F in July, and average lows range from 16F in late January and early February to 60F in July.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Demographics ==\u000aAs of the census of 2010, there were 8,511 people residing in the borough. The racial makeup of the borough was 93.9% White, 1.0% African American, 0.2% Native American, 1.0% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 0.5% from other races, and 1.4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.5% of the population.\u000aAs of the census of 2000, there were 8,828 people, 3,294 households, and 2,338 families residing in the borough. The population density was 3,408.9 people per square mile (1,316.0/km²). There were 3,378 housing units at an average density of 1,304.4 per square mile (503.6/km²). The racial makeup of the borough was 97.77% White, 0.59% African American, 0.16% Native American, 0.53% Asian, 0.36% from other races, and 0.59% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.36% of the population.\u000aThere were 3,294 households, out of which 40.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.0% were married couples living together, 8.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.0% were non-families. 24.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.68 and the average family size was 3.25.\u000aIn the borough the population was spread out, with 29.6% under the age of 18, 6.5% from 18 to 24, 34.3% from 25 to 44, 19.0% from 45 to 64, and 10.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females there were 98.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 95.4 males.\u000aThe median income for a household in the borough is $52,000, and the median income for a family is $59,413. Males have a median income of $42,388 versus $28,323 for females. The per capita income for the borough is $21,986. 4.7% of the population and 4.2% of families are below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 3.3% of those under the age of 18 and 7.9% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.\u000aPerkasie is served by the Pennridge School District.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Infrastructure ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Transportation ===\u000aThe borough's nearest airport is Pennridge Airport, a public general aviation airport with one 4,200-foot (1,300 m)-long runway. It is just north of the center of town, on the other side of the East Rockhill Township border.\u000aPerkasie was once served by the Reading Railroad's North Penn Division, also known as the Bethlehem Branch, which was once part of the North Pennsylvania Railroad. The line is now owned by SEPTA, which ended passenger service in the early 1980s. The last SEPTA-operated Bethlehem Line Philadelphia-bound passenger train passed through Perkasie on July 29, 1981. Conrail subsequently continued operations out of Lansdale up to Quakertown until the mid 90s. The East Penn Railroad, formally known as East Penn Railway (EPRY), leased a portion of the railroad from SEPTA, saving the line from abandonment from Telford through to Quakertown. SEPTA recently issued a formal proposal to perform maintenance on the line and restore passenger service, either installing catenary for electric trains, or using diesel trains connecting to the Lansdale/Doylestown Line in Lansdale.

The electric department originated out of a need to improve street lighting, using a generator before a power plant was built in 1900. In 1947, with the growth in demand for electricity, the borough kept the electric distribution system but begin receiving electricity wholesale from Pennsylvania Power & Light (now PPL Electric Utilities). A modern substation serving the borough's electric system was constructed in 1995. The Perkasie Borough Electric Department currently purchases its electricity wholesale from multiple sources. The borough's Public Works department provides trash collection and recycling, while natural gas service is provided by UGI Utilities.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notable people ==\u000aCincinnati Reds baseball pitcher Jake Eisenhart, b.

aVW\u0119gierska Górka [v\u025bn\u02c8\u0261\u02b2\u025brska \u02c8\u0261urka] is a village in \u017bywiec County, Silesian Voivodeship, in the historic province of Lesser Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina W\u0119gierska Górka. It lies approximately 12 kilometres (7 mi) south-west of \u017bywiec and 72 km (45 mi) south of the regional capital Katowice. It has a population of 4,206.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Location ==\u000aW\u0119gierska Górka is located among the hills of the \u017bywiec Beskids, on the So\u0142a river. For most of its existence, the village, together with \u017bywiec, was administratively and culturally tied with Kraków and Lesser Poland. Until 1975, it belonged to Kraków Voivodeship. In 1975 - 1999, it was part of Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Voivodeship. W\u0119gierska Górka is located on National Road Nr 69 from Bielsko-Bia\u0142a to the border with Slovakia. It has a rail station, on a line from Katowice to Skalite.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe village was first mentioned in documents in 1477, when Polish King Kazimierz Jagiello\u0144czyk argued with Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus over the shape of the border between the two nations. In 1706, Franciszek Wielopolski opened here a folwark, calling it W\u0119gierska Górka. In 1838 Adam Wielopolski founded here ironworks, and two years later, a blast furnace was completed. At that time, W\u0119gierska Górka belonged to the Austrian province of Galicia, which was the result of the Partitions of Poland. After a few years, the W\u0119gierska Górka Ironworks became one of the largest such enterprises in Galicia. In 1884, W\u0119gierska Górka received a rail connection with other locations, and the village quickly grew in size and population.\u000aIn the Second Polish Republic, W\u0119gierska Górka became a popular winter sports center, and a mountain spa. In September 1939, the village was the site of the Battle of W\u0119gierska Górka. Polish defensive fortifications, built before World War II, can still be found and visited here. In 1961 the population of the village was 2,215. A new school was opened on 23 July 1961, and in the late 1960s / early 1970s, a whole district of blocks of flats was built.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a Media related to W\u0119gierska Górka at Wikimedia Commons

aVThe columnar phase is a class of mesophases in which molecules assemble into cylindrical structures to act as mesogens. Originally, these kinds of liquid crystals were called discotic liquid crystals or bowlic liquid crystals  because the columnar structures are composed of flat-shaped discotic or bowl-shaped molecules stacked one-dimensionally. Since recent findings provide a number of columnar liquid crystals consisting of non-discoid mesogens, it is more common now to classify this state of matter and compounds with these properties as columnar liquid crystals.\u000aTakuzo Aida and co-workers recently reported cyclic peptides that self-assemble into polar columnar organizations. These materials can be unidirectionally aligned over large areas by application of an external electric field.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Classes ==\u000aColumnar liquid crystals are grouped by their structural order and the ways of packing of the columns. Nematic columnar liquid crystals have no long-range order and are less organized than other columnar liquid crystals. Other columnar phases with long-range order are classified by their two-dimensional lattices: hexagonal, tetragonal, rectangular, and oblique phases.\u000aThe discotic nematic phase includes nematic liquid crystals composed of flat-shaped discotic molecules without long-range order. In this phase, molecules do not form specific columnar assemblies but only float with their short axes in parallel to the director (a unit vector which defines the liquid-crystalline alignment and order).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Current topics of interest ==\u000aThe first discotic liquid crystal was found in 1977 by the Indian researcher Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar. This molecule has one central benzene ring surrounded by six alkyl chains. Since then, a large number of discoid mesogenic compounds have been discovered in which triphenylene, porphyrin, phthalocyanine, coronene, and other aromatic molecules are involved. The typical columnar liquid-crystalline molecules have a pi-electron-rich aromatic core attached by flexible alkyl chains. This structure is attracting particular attention for potential molecular electronics in which aromatic parts transport electrons or holes and alkyl chains act as insulating parts. The advantages of liquid-crystalline conductors are their anisotropy, processibility, and self-healing characteristics for structural defects.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000aDavid Dunmur & Tim Sluckin (2011) Soap, Science, and Flat-screen TVs: a history of liquid crystals, pp 258\u201362, Oxford University Press ISBN 978-0-19-954940-5 .

aVMateship is an Australian cultural idiom that embodies equality, loyalty and friendship, usually among men. Russel Ward, in The Australian Legend (1958), saw the concept as a central one to the Australian people. Mateship derives from mate, meaning friend, commonly used in Australia as an amicable form of address.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Military context ==\u000aMateship is regarded as an Australian military virtue. For instance, the Australian Army Recruit Training Centre lists the "soldierly qualities" it seeks to instill as including "a will to win, dedication to duty, honour, compassion and honesty, mateship and teamwork, loyalty, and physical and moral courage."\u000aThe word mate bloomed during World War I, when lots of trenches were being built because of the machine gun. Many trenches were built very and often stretched miles across war grounds. There was lots of digging to be done or bodies would be everywhere. The words \u201cdiggers\u201d and \u201cmate\u201d gained the same meaning and became \u201cinterchangeable\u201d. \u000a\u000a\u000a== Australian Constitutional preamble ==\u000aDuring the 1999 Australian constitutional referendum there was some consideration regarding the inclusion of the term "mateship" in the preamble of the Australian constitution. This proposed change was drafted by the Australian poet Les Murray, in consultation with the Prime Minister of the time, John Howard:\u000a\u000aAustralians are free to be proud of their country and heritage, free to realise themselves as individuals, and free to pursue their hopes and ideals. We value excellence as well as fairness, independence as dearly as mateship.\u000a\u000aMurray was not supportive of the inclusion of "mateship" in the preamble, stating that it was "blokeish" and "not a real word", but the Prime Minister insisted it be included as the term, he said, had "a hallowed place in the Australian lexicon". Howard reluctantly dropped the term from the preamble, after the Australian Democrats refused to allow it to be passed by the Senate where they held the balance of power.\u000aSince the referendum the Australian government has introduced the concept of mateship as a possible part of an Australian citizenship test, although it was unclear how endorsement of the values of mateship would be tested.\u000a\u000a\u000a== More than friendship ==\u000aMateship is a concept that can be traced back to early colonial times. The harsh environment in which convicts and new settlers found themselves meant that men and women closely relied on each other for all sorts of help. In Australia, a 'mate' is more than just a friend and is a term that implies a sense of shared experience, mutual respect and unconditional assistance.\u000aThe term includes use in ways other than friendship like getting someone's attention, replacing a name, questioning a statement, letting one know calm down and referring to someone in a rash or harsh way. The use of such in a harsh or negative way can be traced back to the word "bastard". Around the 16th century, the "word" mate adopted a similar meaning. Only within the last two centuries, has the term connected itself with a meaning of friendship.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aCulture of Australia\u000aANZAC spirit\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aDyrenfurth, Nick (2015), Mateship: A Very Australian History, Scribe Publications, Melbourne\u000aPage, James S.

aVMajnoon Island is an island in southern Iraq near Al-Qurnah that is a center for oil production of the Majnoon Oilfield. The area was built out of sand dunes and mud to create pathways for oil pipelines.\u000aBefore the Gulf War, roughly a sixth of Iraq's oil production, some 7 million barrels (1,100,000 m3), passed through this island. Production quickly recovered after the site was a center of fighting in the Iran-Iraq War, particularly Operation Kheibar in 1984. However, following the imposition of United Nations sanctions and the 2003 Iraq War, production has presently reduced to 46,000 barrels per day (7,300 m3/d).\u000aIn December 2009, the Iraqi government awarded a license to a joint venture from Royal Dutch Shell and Petronas to take over operations at Majnoon Oilfield, and triple production from the estimated reserve of 13 billion barrels (2.1×109 m3) at a fee rate of $1.39/barrel.

He is the son of Robert Wozniak, a developmental psychologist dad, and Nora Wozniak, a free spirited Bohemian mother.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Solo career, Marcy Playground, and Personal life ==\u000aJohn a.k.a. "Woz", learned how to play the guitar at the age of 14. His first solo effort was Zog BogBean - From the Marcy Playground, recorded in his own home in 1990. In 2006 he recorded his second solo album, Leaving Wonderland...in a fit of rage and while searching for a label to release it on, decided to call it a Marcy Playground album and include new songs recorded with the rest of the band.[1].\u000aAside from influences such as Neil Young, Paul Simon, and Van Morrison, a major early influence in Woz's life was his high school girlfriend from tenth grade until his freshmen year in college, Sherry Fraser, now of the band Two Ton Boa. She collaborated with Wozniak on Zog Bogbean, and on the song "Ancient Walls of Flowers" from Marcy Playground's self-titled album. The song "Sherry Fraser" was written about her. They were known for being good friends throughout high school and would make movies or write together.\u000aWoz moved to Great Neck, Long Island in 1994 in order to collaborate with his then friend Jared Kotler, a multi-instrumentalist/music producer. John had written two albums worth of material and began recording what would become the eponymous "Marcy Playground" recordings at Sabella Recording studios in suburban New York. This included the definitive recording of the soon to be hit single "Sex and Candy". More recording sessions followed with John and Jared hiring Dylan Keefe to take over bass playing duties. Over two albums of material were recorded at Sebella by Engineer Ken Goia and these recordings brought the band to the attention of Capitol Records. The band was soon signed to Capitol and began a year long series of club dates in New York City performing live in support of "Marcy Playground". The band then began a radio promotion tour of the US following the release of the first single "Poppies". Shortly after the label then released the follow-up single "Sex and Candy". This song became a smash hit, and ended up rising to a then-record 15 weeks at number one on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart. Three albums later, the band produced several singles and several other semi-hits. Woz continues to regularly write, record and tour with Marcy Playground. Woz is remarried and has a son named Keegan, by whom the song "Keegan's Christmas" is inspired.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other Collaborations ==\u000aOn June 6, 1997, at the John Anson Ford Theatre in Hollywood, Woz joined Toad the Wet Sprocket on stage during the band's encore, trading verses with Toad frontman Glen Phillips, to sing a cover of David Bowie's "Ziggy Stardust". [2]\u000aIn 2003, Woz helped produce Canadian rock band Stabilo's second album, recorded at John's studio known as Mushroom Studios.\u000aLater that year, Woz would work with Jimi Haha of the band Jimmie's Chicken Shack to write the song "Paper Dolls", a fast punk-sounding song about growing up and being manipulated. The song appeared on both bands albums in 2004.[3]\u000aIn 2006, Woz teamed up with Canadian hit-maker Daniel Powter ("Bad Day") amongst other musicians to add new flavor to Leaving Wonderland...in a fit of rage, the solo album turned Marcy Playground album.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe University of St. Thomas (also known as St. Thomas) is a private, Catholic, liberal arts, and archdiocesan university located in St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Founded in 1885 as a Catholic seminary, it is named after Thomas Aquinas, the medieval Catholic theologian and philosopher who is the patron saint of students. St. Thomas currently enrolls more than 10,000 students, making it Minnesota's largest private, non-profit university. Julie Sullivan became the 15th president in the history of the University in 2013.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aFounded in 1885 by John Ireland, archbishop of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, St. Thomas began as an all-male, Catholic seminary. In 1894, the liberal arts program became an independent college through a gift from local railroad tycoon James J. Hill, who provided funds to establish the Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity apart from the college. In 1903, the College of St. Thomas established a military program on campus, and it was officially termed a military school by the U.S. War Department in 1906. Initially, the school gave out two-year diplomas in commercial and classical programs before awarding its first academic degrees in 1915. In 1922, military training became optional.\u000aFrom the late 1920s through the mid-1930s, the Holy Cross Fathers, who run the University of Notre Dame, controlled the college's administration. The diocese called those priests in to help with the school's financial problems; those priests were known as a crisis intervention team of sorts for parochial schools of that time. During World War II, St. Thomas served as a training base for naval officers, which kept the school open when men who would have attended college were fighting in the war. After the war, in 1948, the college established "Tom Town" on the eastern end of the lower quadrant, which is currently the site to the O'Shaughnessey-Frey Library and O'Shaughnessey Education Center. Tom Town, made of 20 double-dwelling huts, consisted of white, barrack-like housing units for faculty, students and their families. The units helped to meet housing demand after World War II.\u000aIn the latter half of the 20th century, St. Thomas started two of its most notable graduate programs: Education in 1950 and Business Administration in 1974. The school became co-educational in 1977 and although women were not allowed to enroll until then, female students from St. Catherine University (then the College of St. Catherine) often took classes at St. Thomas. Women were also present as instructors and administrators on campus but the staff, faculty, and administration has seen a vast increase in female employment since the move to co-education. In 1990, the College of St. Thomas became the University of St. Thomas and the following year, the university opened the Minneapolis campus. In 2001, St. Thomas reinstated its School of Law at its Minneapolis Campus; it had been shut down during the Great Depression. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was the speaker at the Grand Opening.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Campuses ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Saint Paul ===\u000a\u000aThe St. Paul campus is home to most undergraduate students. The main campus, built on a farm site once considered "far removed from town", is located where St. Paul's Summit Avenue meets the Mississippi River. The site was farmed by ex-Fort Snelling soldier William Finn, who received the property as a pension settlement after he accidentally shot himself in the hand while on guard duty.\u000aThe western edge of the campus borders the Mississippi Gorge Regional Park. Summit Avenue, which runs through the middle of the campus, is the country's longest span of Victorian homes. This tree-lined avenue includes the Governor's Mansion, F. Scott Fitzgerald's townhome, and James J. Hill's mansion.\u000a\u000aIn 2005, a new apartment-style residence hall was built on an existing parking lot. McNeely Hall was also built the following year. It is a large classroom building for business that replaced the smaller building of the same name. A new residential village, more parking ramps, and general planning all have been negotiated successfully with the surrounding neighborhood. These developments are expected to begin within the next five years.\u000aIn early 2012, St. Thomas completed the final stage of its three building expansion on the St. Paul campus. The two main additions that were completed are the Anderson Athletic and Recreation Center (AARC) and the Anderson Student Center. These projects were completed in the Summer of 2010 and January 2012, respectively. The Anderson Athletic and Recreation Center has a field house, basketball arena, weight room, and swimming pool. The track in the field house is home to the most dominant track team in the MIAC conference. Other St. Thomas sports that use the AARC's facilities have also endured recent success, including a playoff run for the football team, and a National Championship for the Men's Basketball team. The new Anderson Student Center is home to new food venues as well as entertainment options including a game room and a bowling alley, and a coffee shop. There is also an art gallery on the second floor, which is home to the American Museum of Asmat Art.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Minneapolis ===\u000a\u000aIn fall 1992, the university opened a permanent, 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2) campus at 1000 LaSalle Ave. in Minneapolis. The first building, named Terrence Murphy Hall in May 2000, is headquarters to the university's Opus College of Business. Artist Mark Balma created one of the largest frescoes in the United States on the arched ceiling of its atrium. The seven-panel, 1,904 square feet (176.9 m2) fresco was completed in the summer of 1994 and portrays the seven virtues discussed in the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas. The Minneapolis campus also holds St. Thomas' School of Education, the School of Law, and Schulze School of Entrepreneurship.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Daniel C. Gainey Conference Center (Owatonna) ===\u000aOn May 15, 2014, it was announced that the Daniel C. Gainey Conference Center was sold to Meridian Behavioral Health, LLC with a plan to convert it to a treatment facility for addiction and behavioral disorders. The deal closed in August 2014. The deal included the entire 180 acre property and all the buildings except for the Winston Guest House, which was designed by architect Frank Gehry. St. Thomas is still exploring options for the house which will remain on the Gainey property for up to two years. Terms were not disclosed.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Bernardi (Rome) ===\u000aSince Fit Bike Company was created in 1999 the University of St. Thomas has been the only university in the United States to have a formal affiliation with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Presidents ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Academics ==\u000a\u000aEach year the university awards almost 2,500 degrees including five different bachelor's degrees (B.A., B.M., B.S., B.S.M.E. and B.S.E.E.). There are 88 major fields at the undergraduate level, with 59 minor fields of study and seven pre-professional programs. At the graduate and professional level, the university offers 41 master's degrees, two education specialist, one juris doctor and five doctorates.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Schools and colleges ===\u000aThe university offers its degree programs through nine divisions. The College of Arts and Sciences includes undergraduate departments in the arts, humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences, plus a number of interdisciplinary programs. The Opus College of Business has seven departments offering graduate and undergraduate curricula including Executive Education and Professional Development at University of St. Thomas, and is one of six AACSB accredited business schools in Minnesota. St. Thomas also houses the Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity, which offers master's- and doctoral-level degrees oriented to theological study and the practice of ministry. St. John Vianney Seminary, a minor college seminary, is also at St. Thomas. Other schools include the School of Education, the School of Engineering, and the School of Social Work. The Master of Social Work is offered as a double degree program with the St. Catherine University.\u000a\u000aSchools housed on the Minneapolis campus include the Graduate School of Professional Psychology, Undergraduate and Graduate Schools of Education, Graduate Programs in Software Engineering, and the School of Law, which was re-opened in 1999 after a 66-year hiatus.\u000aThe University of St. Thomas is a member of the Associated Colleges of the Twin Cities (ACTC), a consortium of five private liberal arts colleges. This program allows students to take classes at one of the associated colleges for no additional cost. Other schools include Hamline University, St. Catherine University, Macalester College, and Augsburg University.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Athletics ==\u000a\u000aSt. Thomas's school colors are purple and gray, and the athletic teams are called the Tommies. The mascot for these teams is "Tommie". The name Tommy was changed to Tommie with an 'ie' when women were accepted as full-time students to be more inclusive of the women. St. Thomas is a member of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC), which performs at the NCAA Division III level. Since 1885 athletics have been present on St. Thomas' campus. The first sports teams that became popular were intramural. The top intramural baseball teams in the 1890s were the "Blues" and "Grays", which is where the Tommies' school colors come from. Varsity sports did not begin until 1904. St. Thomas celebrated its 100th year of varsity athletics in 2003\u20132004.\u000aSt. Thomas' longtime archrival is Saint John's University from Collegeville, Minnesota. Recent national titles include men's basketball in 2011 and 2016; men's baseball in 2009 and 2001; women's softball in 2005 and 2004; men's lacrosse (MCLA Division II) in 2016, 2013, 2012, 2010 and 2009; women's volleyball in 2012; and dance team in 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2008 and 2006. St. Thomas also won national championships with women's basketball in 1991; men's cross country in 1986 and 1984; men's indoor track in 1985; and women's cross country in 1987, 1986, 1984 and 1982. In 2012, St. Thomas played for the first time in the Stagg Bowl in Salem, Virginia, which is the Division III Football National Championship game, against the University of Mount Union, losing 28-10.\u000aWCCO broadcasts radio coverage of Tommies football games since 2011.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Student life ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Student housing ===\u000a\u000aUndergraduate housing is found on the St. Paul Campus. Approximately 2,400 residents live in 10 traditional halls and apartments. Additionally, St. John Vianney College Seminary holds approximately 140 students. All but one (Murrary Herrick) traditional halls are single-sex, while apartment residences are co-ed by floor. Residence halls on campus are named after Archbishops of Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul, such as William O. Brady, Austin Dowling, and John Ireland. The all-female traditional hall of John Paul II is named after the former Pope. Built in 1894, Cretin Hall is the oldest hall on campus and was designed (along with Loras and Grace halls) by Emmanuel Louis Masqueray.\u000aRecently the department of residence life has purchased additional buildings on what they are calling 'mid-campus' in the area between Grand and Summit Avenues. These buildings house men and women transfer students in one of two buildings, separated by gender. There are two apartment complexes that are specifically designed for sophomores. Also, they house students in the residence above the Child Development Center, which is a day-care facility on campus.\u000a\u000aThe University of St. Thomas offers special interest floors, or floors that are intended to house specific residents with similar interests or class standing. Almost one-third of all floors are First Year Experience floors, which consist of only freshmen. This practice attempts to create a cohesive community by placing students together that will have a similar experience. First Year students have the opportunity to participate in Living Learning Communities (LLCs). These include Sustainability, Aquinas Scholars, Tommies Do Well(ness), Pathways to Engineering, COJO MOJO, Bridging Divides, Catholic Studies, Major Explorers, and Business for the Common Good.\u000aHousing Policies\u000aThe campus is not dry: students over 21 years of age are allowed alcohol in their room.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Undergraduate Student Government ===\u000aThe on-campus student association is the Undergraduate Student Government (USG), formerly known as the ACC. The student government is made up of an executive board and general council. Each executive board member receives a stipend. The executive board consists of the president of the student body, executive vice president, vice president of financial affairs, vice president of academic affairs, vice president of administrative affairs and vice president of public relations. The general council consists of class presidents, class senators and representatives from various university organizations.\u000aThe student government oversees funding to all clubs on campus, approves new club requests, appoints students to various university committees and represents the student body to the administration. USG has its own offices located in the student center. Elections are held in the fall and spring every academic year.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Controversy ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Desmond Tutu ===\u000aIn 2007, the president of the University of St. Thomas, Father Dennis Dease, cancelled a planned speech by Nobel Peace Prize laureate and anti-apartheid figure, Desmond Tutu, on the grounds that his presence might offend some members of the local Jewish community. Many faculty members of Voice for Peace led an email campaign calling on St. Thomas to reconsider its decision, which the president did and invited Tutu to campus. Tutu declined the re-invitation, speaking instead at the Minneapolis Convention Center at an event hosted by Metropolitan State University. However, Tutu later addressed the issue two days later while making his final appearance at Metro State.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Demolition of Foley Theater ===\u000aIn 2008, plans were announced to the public that the theater department at the University of St. Thomas was to be dissolved and that the school would no longer offer this major. Declining numbers of theater majors was publicly cited as the reason. However, during this same time, plans were underway to make space for a new student center to be named after the Anderson family, then the largest single donors to a single private institution in United States history. Despite protests from senior faculty and students, the decision was made to demolish the theater and dissolve the department the same semester; though, according to the Dean of St. Thomas's College of Arts and Sciences, Marisa Kelly, the two decisions were "completely unrelated".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notable faculty and staff ==\u000a\u000aJohn Abraham \u2013 Professor in the School of Engineering\u000aMichael Murphy Andregg \u2013 Geneticist and peace activist\u000aArchbishop William Brady\u000aDon J.

aVThe Moclips River is a river in the U.S. state of Washington. It is about 12 miles (19 km) long. Its main tributary, the North Fork Moclips River, is longer than the main stem. The length of the North Fork, along with the lower main stem below the North Fork's confluence, is 17 miles (27 km). The drainage basin of the Moclips River is 22.4 square miles (58 km2) in area.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Course ==\u000aBoth the Moclips River and its main tributary, the North Fork Moclips River, originate on the slopes of Macafee Hill. Both flow generally west. The North Fork joins the main river about 2 miles (3.2 km) from the Pacific Ocean. The Moclips River empties into the Pacific near Moclips.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aAccording to Edmond S.

aVA Cadet corps (Russian: \u041a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043f\u0443\u0441, translit. Kadetskiy korpus), historically an admissions-based all-boys military cadets school, prepared boys to become commissioned officers in Imperial Russia. Boys entered a cadet corps between the ages of 8 and 15. Empress Anna Ivanovna founded the first cadet corps in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, in 1731. The term of education was seven years. All instructors had a military rank; they taught a full program of military preparation. In 1766 Catherine the Great's educational reforms broadened the curriculum to include the sciences, philosophy, ethics, history, and international law.\u000aA graduate from the corps became a junker and had prime candidacy for a military career.\u000aDuring the October Revolution and the 1917-1923 Russian Civil War, cadets and junkers largely supported the anti-bolshevik White movement. (Distinguish the military cadets of this era from the members of the Constitutional Democratic Party, known from its initials (KD) as Kadets. The Constitutional Democratic Party also opposed Bolshevism.) A small portion of cadets succeeded in evacuating with the White Army towards the end of Russian Civil War to western countries. Subsequently, the Soviet Government executed or imprisoned all surviving cadets to Siberian GULAG slave-labor camps. Fifteen years later, according to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, none remained alive and free inside the USSR.\u000a\u000aMany cadets who escaped alive formed cadet corps in other countries, most notably at Bela Crkva in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, where they received the patronage of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia (reigned 1921-1934) - himself a former pupil in the Saint Petersburg Page Corps.\u000aDuring World War II a number of White émigré ex.cadets joined the Axis-sponsored Russian Corps (founded in 1941) in Yugoslavia and the Guard of the general A.A.Vlasow (ROA), seeing it as a means of continuing the battle against the Bolshevik régime.\u000aAfter World War II ended in 1945, with the emigration of cadets to the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Australia, White émigré cadet corps ceased to function. A cadet union was formed to unite the graduates of the cadet corps.\u000aAfter the fall of the USSR in 1991, cadet corps were re-established in Russia by veterans of the armed forces and descendants of cadet corps graduates. These now educate both boys and girls, with several units named after Soviet Great Patriotic War heroes as well as after Russian military heroes through the centuries. These Cadet Corps and Cadet Schools, found in various Russian cities, aim towards preparing children for service not just in the Russian Armed Forces but also in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the National Guard of Russia, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, and the Federal Security Service (FSB). One cadet corps prepares teens for service in the Ministry of Justice; the Moscow Diplomatic Cadet Corps educates those inclined towards future careers in the diplomatic services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Traditionally, the cadets use the regular army field uniform, but with the own sleeve insignias and the letters "KK" on the shoulder boards.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cadets educational establishments in the USSR and Russia ==\u000aSuvorov Military School\u000aSaint Petersburg rocket artillery cadet corps\u000aNakhimov Naval School\u000aKronstadt Sea Cadet Corps\u000aMoscow National Pensions School Cadet Corps\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aPage Corps (Russia)\u000aSea Cadet Corps (Russia)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

Slater's father, John Slater, served as President of the New Zealand National Party from 1998 to 2001.\u000aSlater believes in reforming the name-suppression laws in New Zealand. In late 2009 he gained notoriety for naming two high-profile sex offenders, and consequently became the first blogger in New Zealand to face charges for breaching a name-suppression order. In January 2010 he named a third person accused of sex offences, and in February 2010 named another person convicted on child-pornography charges. In 2014 Nicky Hager's book Dirty Politics demonstrated Slater's close ties to Justice Minister Judith Collins and to Prime Minister John Key and speculated that Slater had been paid to write attack articles on public figures.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Blogging career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Awards ===\u000aNetGuide Best Blog Award 2013\u000aCanon Media Awards Blog of the Year 2014\u000aNetGuide Best Blog Award 2014\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Challenges to name suppression laws ===\u000aOn 23 December 2009, Slater was charged with five counts of breaching name suppression orders. The charges relate to two blog posts that contained pictures which revealed the identities of a prominent New Zealand entertainer and a former New Zealand Olympian who were each charged with sexual offences.\u000aOn 11 January 2010, Slater published a blog post that used binary and hexadecimal code to allege the identity of a former Member of Parliament charged with indecent assault on a 13-year-old girl. The Nelson Bays police announced that they would investigate this further breach of New Zealand's name suppression laws.\u000aHe pleaded not guilty to the five name suppression charges on 9 February 2010, and the same day revealed the identity of a prominent Palmerston North resident whose name was suppressed after being found guilty of possessing thousands of pornographic images of children. In August 2010 he went on trial, now facing ten charges of breaching suppression orders. In September he was convicted of nine of the charges, eight of breaching suppression orders for offenders and one of naming a victim in a sexual abuse case. He was fined $750 and ordered to pay court costs of $130 for each of the nine cases.\u000aIn May 2010, Slater published the name of a public servant who had permanent name suppression, after a Wellington District Court jury found him not guilty of assaulting his teenage son. The matter reignited the national debate over the internet and name suppression and the public servant's lawyer Mike Antunovic publicly labelled Slater a "renegade."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== "Feral" controversy ===\u000aOn 27 January 2014, Slater published a brief post with the headline,"Feral dies in Greymouth, did world a favour". At the time of the headline all that the media had reported was that one person had been killed when a car crashed at high speed into the bedroom of a house in Greymouth after ignoring Police. The article Slater wrote was about how the media had handled the coverage and had blamed the Police. The identity of the dead man was not known at that time.\u000aThe post led to objections from the general public and suspected hacking attempts on his blog site. Some people called on Slater for an apology to the young man's family at least. Slater moved his family in response to the threats, but refused to apologise. In lieu of an apology, Slater offered the following: "[W]here is it written in the rule books that you have to take into account people\u2019s feelings?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Visits to Kim Dotcom mansion controversy ===\u000aIn February 2014, Prime Minister John Key said in the media that Winston Peters had visited the Kim Dotcom mansion three times. This information turned out to be correct, and Peters publicly challenged Key to release the source of the information, suggesting that the Prime Minister had used spying agencies to track his movements. Key denied that spy agencies had been involved, and hinted that the source of the information was Cameron Slater. Key said that while he did not agree with everything Slater posted, he talked to the blogger "every so often" and had talked to him about Kim Dotcom and other things that week.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Matthew Blomfield complaint and defamation case ===\u000aA criminal complaint against Cameron Slater was made by Hell's Pizza chain franchisee, Matt Blomfield. Blomfield also took a defamation case against Slater for comments Slater made about him on his blog.\u000aCameron Slater was found in contempt of court in September 2015 and fined $1500 by Justice Raynor Asher.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Dirty Politics controversy ===\u000a\u000aIn August 2014 a book by Nicky Hager called Dirty Politics was published based on correspondence hacked from Cameron Slater's computer. Two months later, the police raided Hager's house seizing computers and other equipment looking for information to assist them find out who hacked the emails from Slater's computer.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Links to the New Zealand National Party ====\u000aThe book discussed Slater's close friendship with Justice Minister Judith Collins. Amongst other discussions of New Zealand politics, Hager wrote that Slater had found a database of Labour Party information on a public Labour Party website, and that with the help of Jason Ede \u2013 one of the press secretaries of the Prime Minister, John Key \u2013 Slater used the information to attack the Labour Party during the 2011 election campaign.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Resignation of Judith Collins ====\u000aOn Saturday 30 August 2014 Judith Collins, a senior Cabinet Minister in the John Key-led National Party government, resigned as a minister in the wake of an email suggesting that she had sought to undermine former Serious Fraud Office (SFO) Chief Executive Adam Feeley in league with Slater.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Legal troubles with Colin Craig, 2015\u20132016 ===\u000aIn June 2015, Cameron Slater published a love poem by the Conservative Party leader Colin Craig entitled "Two of Me" on his blog Whale Oil. This poem was linked to sexual harassment allegations involving Craig and the Conservative Party's former press secretary Rachel MacGregor. Due to the negative publicity and internal tensions within the Conservatives, Craig resigned as Party leader on 19 June 2015. Craig's resignation preceded an internal rift within the Conservatives between supporters and opponents of the former leader; which led to the aggrieved parties taking each other to court.\u000aIn response to Slater's actions, Craig filed a defamation suit against Slater and two other opponents, New Zealand Taxpayers' Union chairman Jordan Williams and former Conservative party board member John Stringer for NZ$650,000, NZ$300,000 and NZ$350,000 respectively. In addition, Craig also circulated a booklet, entitled "Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas", which attacked Slater, Williams and Stringer and labeled them as part of the "Dirty Politics Brigade"; a reference to Nicky Hager's Dirty Politics book. Slater responded by slamming the mass circulation of the "Dirty Politics" booklet as a violating of postal rules around unsolicited mail.\u000aOn 24 November 2015, Colin Craig issued an email ultimatum to Slater; claiming copyright ownership over the poem "Two of Me" and demanding that the latter issue a retraction, written apology, and pay NZ$3,000 per month for displaying the poem on Whale Oil. The invoice amounted to a total of NZ$15,000. Slater responded by rejecting Craig's ultimatum and indicating that he was prepared to clash with Craig in court. On 3 April 2016, Craig tabled legal papers seeking more than NZ$13,000 in damages from Slater for publishing the poem on his blog.\u000a\u000a\u000a== The New Zealand Truth ==\u000aAt the end of October 2012, Slater was announced as the editor for tabloid newspaper the New Zealand Truth. He said in his new role he would be "kicking arse and sticking up for the little guy". His first issue was published in November 2012. The Truth ceased production in July 2013.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aOn the weekend of 29\u201330 May 2010, Slater and his wife sold their home after their income insurance provider, Fidelity Insurance, stopped payments for depression.

aVThe Battle of Pharsalus was a decisive battle of Caesar's Civil War. On 9 August 48 BC at Pharsalus in central Greece, Gaius Julius Caesar and his allies formed up opposite the army of the republic under the command of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great"). Pompey had the backing of a majority of the senators, of whom many were optimates, and his army significantly outnumbered the veteran Caesarian legions.\u000aThe two armies confronted each other over several months of uncertainty, Caesar being in a much weaker position than Pompey. The former found himself isolated in a hostile country with only 22,000 men and short of provisions, while on the other side of the river he was faced by Pompey with an army about twice as large in number. Pompey wanted to delay, knowing the enemy would eventually surrender from hunger and exhaustion. Pressured by the senators present and by his officers, he reluctantly engaged in battle and suffered an overwhelming defeat, ultimately fleeing the camp and his men, disguised as an ordinary citizen.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Prelude ==\u000aA dispute between Caesar and the optimates faction in the Senate of Rome culminated in Caesar marching his army on Rome and forcing Pompey, accompanied by much of the Roman Senate, to flee in 49 BC from Italy to Greece, where he could better conscript an army to face his former ally. Caesar, lacking a fleet to immediately give chase, solidified his control over the western Mediterranean \u2013 Spain specifically \u2013 before assembling ships to follow Pompey. Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, whom Pompey had appointed to command his 600-ship fleet, set up a massive blockade to prevent Caesar from crossing to Greece and to prevent any aid to Italy. Caesar, defying convention, chose to cross the Adriatic during the winter, with only half his fleet at a time. This move surprised Bibulus, and the first wave of ships managed to run the blockade easily. Now prepared, Bibulus managed to prevent any further ships from crossing, but died soon afterwards.\u000aCaesar was now in a precarious position, holding a beachhead at Epirus with only half his army, no ability to supply his troops by sea, and limited local support, as the Greek cities were mostly loyal to Pompey. Caesar's only choice was to fortify his position, forage what supplies he could, and wait on his remaining army to attempt another crossing. Pompey by now had a massive international army; however, his troops were mostly untested raw recruits, while Caesar's troops were hardened veterans. Realizing Caesar's difficulty in keeping his troops supplied, Pompey decided to simply mirror Caesar's forces and let hunger do the fighting for him. Caesar began to despair and used every channel he could think of to pursue peace with Pompey. When this was rebuffed he made an attempt to cross back to Italy to collect his missing troops, but was turned back by a storm. Finally, Mark Antony rallied the remaining forces in Italy, fought through the blockade and made the crossing, reinforcing Caesar's forces in both men and spirit. Now at full strength, Caesar felt confident to take the fight to Pompey.\u000aPompey was camped in a strong position just south of Dyrrhachium with the sea to his back and surrounded by hills, making a direct assault impossible. Caesar ordered a wall to be built around Pompey's position in order to cut off water and pasture land for his horses. Pompey built a parallel wall and in between a kind of no man's land was created, with fighting comparable to the trench warfare of World War I. Ultimately the standoff was broken when a traitor in Caesar's army informed Pompey of a weakness in Caesar's wall. Pompey immediately exploited this information and forced Caesar's army into a full retreat, but ordered his army not to pursue, fearing Caesar's reputation for setting elaborate traps. This caused Caesar to remark, "Today the victory had been the enemy's, had there been any one among them to gain it." Pompey continued his strategy of mirroring Caesar's forces and avoiding any direct engagements. After trapping Caesar in Thessaly, the prominent senators in Pompey's camp began to argue loudly for a more decisive victory. Although Pompey was strongly against it \u2014 he wanted to surround and starve Caesar's army instead \u2014 he eventually gave in and accepted battle from Caesar on a field near Pharsalus.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Date and location ==\u000aThe date of the actual decisive battle is given as 9 August 48 BC according to the republican calendar. According to the Julian calendar however, the date was either 29 June (according to Le Verrier's chronological reconstruction) or possibly 7 June (according to Drumann/Groebe). As Pompey was assassinated on 3 September 48 BC, the battle must have taken place in the true month of August, when the harvest was becoming ripe (or Pompey's strategy of starving Caesar would not be plausible).\u000aThe location of the battlefield was for a long time the subject of controversy among scholars. Caesar himself, in his Commentarii de Bello Civili, mentions few place-names; and although the battle is called after Pharsalos, four ancient writers \u2013 the author of the Bellum Alexandrinum (48.1), Frontinus (Strategemata 2.3.22), Eutropius (20), and Orosius (6.15.27) \u2013 place it specifically at Palaepharsalos. Strabo in his Geographica (\u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac) mentions both old and new Pharsaloi, and notes that the Thetideion, the temple to Thetis south of Scotoussa, was near both. In 198 BC, in the Second Macedonian War, Philip V of Macedon sacked Palaepharsalos (Livy, Ab Urbe Condita 32.13.9), but left new Pharsalos untouched. These two details perhaps imply that the two cities were not close neighbours. Until the early 20th century, unsure of the site of Palaepharsalos, scholars followed Appian (2.75) and located the battle of 48 BC south of the Enipeus or close to Pharsalos (today's Pharsala).\u000aThe \u201cnorth-bank\u201d thesis of F. L. Lucas, based on his 1921 solo field-trip to Thessaly, is now, however, broadly accepted by historians. \u201cA visit to the ground has only confirmed me,\u201d Lucas wrote in 1921; \u201cand it was interesting to find that Mr. Apostolides, son of the large local landowner, the hospitality of whose farm at Tekés I enjoyed, was convinced too that the [battle-]site was by Driskole [now Krini], for the very sound reason that neither the hills nor the river further east suit Caesar\u2019s description.\u201d John D. Morgan in his definitive \u201cPalae-pharsalus \u2013 the Battle and the Town\u201d, arguing for a site closer still to Krini, where he places Palaepharsalos, writes: \u201cMy reconstruction is similar to Lucas\u2019s, and in fact I borrow one of his alternatives for the line of the Pompeian retreat. Lucas\u2019s theory has been subjected to many criticisms, but has remained essentially unshaken.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a== Opposing armies ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Caesarian army ===\u000aCaesar had the following legions with him:\u000aLegions of veterans from the Gallic Wars \u2013 Caesar's favourite legion, X Equestris, and those later known with the names of VIII Augusta, IX Hispana, and XII Fulminata\u000aLegions levied for the civil war \u2013 legions later known as I Germanica, III Gallica, and IV Macedonica\u000aHowever, all of these legions were understrength. Some only had about a thousand men at the time of Pharsalus, due partly to losses at Dyrrhachium and partly to Caesar's wish to rapidly advance with a picked body as opposed to a ponderous movement with a large army. According to his accounts, he had 80 cohorts on the battlefield, about 22,000 men.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Pompeian army ===\u000aIn total, Caesar counted 110 complete cohorts in the Pompeian army, 11 legions consisting of about 45,000 men, although Orosius, following Livy and Pollio, only counted 88 cohorts, and Hans Delbrück suggests that Caesar's count includes detachments at Dyrrachium and elsewhere, leaving only 88 cohorts in the Pompeian army.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Battle ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Deployment ===\u000a\u000aOn the Pharsalian plain, Pompey deployed his infantry in the traditional three lines of 10 men deep, thusly: Legions I and III were on the left with Pompey himself; at his center were the legions from Syria commanded by Scipio, and on the right, against the Enipeus River, were legions from Cilicia and Spanish auxiliaries. Pompey's cavalry, which greatly outnumbered Caesar's, were commanded by Labienus, a brilliant cavalry commander and Caesar's old lieutenant during the Gallic Wars. They were massed in a single body on Pompey's left flank, together with his auxiliary archers and slingers. Pompey's tactical plan was to allow Caesar's legions to charge while his own stood their ground, reasoning that the enemy would fatigue by charging the double distance, and that his own men would better withstand the pilum toss while stationary. Simultaneously his cavalry would overwhelm the enemy's and then take the legions in the flank and rear \u2014 a classic hammer and anvil tactic.\u000aCaesar also deployed his men in three lines, but, being outnumbered, had to thin his ranks to a depth of only six men, in order to match the frontage presented by Pompey. His left flank, resting on the Enipeus River, consisted of his battle worn IXth legion supplemented by the VIIIth legion, these commanded by Mark Antony. The center was commanded by Domitius and upon his right he placed his favored Xth legion, giving Sulla command of this flank \u2014 Caesar himself took his stand on the right, across from Pompey. Upon seeing the disposition of Pompey's army Caesar grew discomforted, and further thinned his third line in order to form a fourth line on his right: this to counter the onslaught of the enemy cavalry, which he knew his numerically inferior cavalry could not withstand. This new line he gave detailed instructions for the role they would play, hinting that upon them would rest the fortunes of the day, and gave strict orders to his third line not to charge until specifically ordered.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Progress of the battle ===\u000aThere was significant distance between the two armies, according to Caesar. Pompey ordered his men not to charge, but to wait until Caesar's legions came into close quarters; Pompey's adviser Caius Triarius believed that Caesar's infantry would be fatigued and fall into disorder if they were forced to cover twice the expected distance of a battle march. Also stationary troops were expected to be able to defend better against pila throws. Seeing that Pompey's army was not advancing, Caesar's infantry under Mark Antony and Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus started the advance. As Caesar's men reached near throwing distance, without orders, they stopped to rest and regroup before continuing the charge; Pompey's right and centre line held as the two armies collided.\u000aAs Pompey's infantry fought, Labienus ordered the Pompeian cavalry on his left flank to attack Caesar's cavalry; as expected they successfully pushed back Caesar's cavalry. Caesar then revealed his hidden fourth line of infantry and surprised Pompey's cavalry charge; Caesar's men were ordered to leap up and use their pila to thrust at Pompey's cavalry instead of throwing them. Pompey's cavalry panicked and suffered hundreds of casualties. After failing to reform, the rest of the cavalry retreated to the hills, leaving the left wing of Pompey's legions exposed. Caesar then ordered in his third line, containing his most battle-hardened veterans. These broke Pompey's left wing troops, who fled the battlefield.\u000aAfter routing Pompey's cavalry, Caesar threw in his last line of reserves \u2014a move which at this point meant that the battle was more or less decided. Pompey lost the will to fight as he watched both cavalry and legions under his command break formation and flee from battle, and he retreated to his camp, leaving the rest of his troops at the centre and right flank to their own devices. He ordered the garrisoned auxiliaries to defend the camp as he gathered his family, loaded up gold, and threw off his general's cloak to make a quick escape. As the rest of Pompey's army were left confused, Caesar urged his men to end the day by routing the rest of Pompey's troops and capturing the Pompeian camp. They complied with his wishes; after finishing off the remains of Pompey's men, they furiously attacked the camp walls. The Thracians and the other auxiliaries who were left in the Pompeian camp, in total seven cohorts, defended bravely, but were not able to fend off the assault.\u000aCaesar had won his greatest victory, claiming to have only lost about 200 soldiers and 30 centurions. In his history of the war, Caesar would praise his own men's discipline and experience, and remembered each of his centurions by name. He also questioned Pompey's decision not to charge.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Aftermath ==\u000aPompey fled from Pharsalus to Egypt, where he was assassinated on the order of Ptolemy XIII. Ptolemy XIII sent Pompey's head to Caesar in an effort to win his favor, but instead secured him as a furious enemy. Ptolemy, advised by his regent, the eunuch Pothinus, and his rhetoric tutor Theodotus of Chios, had failed to take into account that Caesar was granting amnesty to a great number of those of the senatorial faction in their defeat. Even men who had been bitter enemies were allowed not only to return to Rome but to assume their previous positions in Roman society.\u000aPompey's assassination had deprived Caesar of his ultimate public relations moment \u2014 pardoning his most ardent rival. The Battle of Pharsalus ended the wars of the First Triumvirate. The Roman Civil War, however, was not ended. Pompey's two sons, Gnaeus Pompeius and Sextus Pompey, and the Pompeian faction, led now by Metellus Scipio and Cato, survived and fought for their cause in the name of Pompey the Great. Caesar spent the next few years 'mopping up' remnants of the senatorial faction. After seemingly vanquishing all his enemies and bringing peace to Rome, he was assassinated in 44 BC by friends, in a conspiracy organized by Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Importance ==\u000a\u000aPaul K. Davis wrote that "Caesar's victory took him to the pinnacle of power, effectively ending the Republic." The battle itself did not end the civil war but it was decisive and gave Caesar a much needed boost in legitimacy. Until then much of the Roman world outside Italy supported Pompey and his allies due to the extensive list of clients he held in all corners of the Republic. After Pompey's defeat former allies began to align themselves with Caesar as some came to believe the gods favored him, while for others it was simple self-preservation. The ancients took great stock in success as a sign of favoritism by the gods. This is especially true of success in the face of almost certain defeat \u2014 as Caesar experienced at Pharsalus. This allowed Caesar to parlay this single victory into a huge network of willing clients to better secure his hold over power and force the Optimates into near exile in search for allies to continue the fight against Caesar.\u000a\u000a\u000a== In popular culture ==\u000aThe battle gives its name to the following artistic, geographical, and business concerns:\u000aPharsalia, a poem by Lucan\u000aPharsalia, New York, U.S.\u000aPharsalia Technologies, Inc.\u000aIn Alexander Dumas' The Three Musketeers, the author makes reference to Caesar's purported order that his men try to cut the faces of their opponents - their vanity supposedly being of more value to them than their lives.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aCaesar's account of the battle\u000aFrank Laurence Lucas, 'The Battlefield of Pharsalos', Annual of the British School at Athens, No. XXIV, 1919\u201321\u000aMichel Rambaud, 'Le Soleil de Pharsale', Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte , Vol.3, No.4, 1955\u000aWilliam E.

aVStjepan "Stijepo" Gradi\u0107 or Stefano Gradi (Latin: Stephanus Gradius; March 6, 1613 \u2013 May 2, 1683) was a philosopher, scientist and a patrician of the Republic of Ragusa.\u000aStijepo's parents were Miho Gradi (Gradi\u0107) and Marija Benessa (Bene\u0161a). He was born in Dubrovnik, Republic of Ragusa, where he was first schooled. He moved to Rome by the order of his uncle, a vicar general of Dubrovnik, Petar Benessa. In Rome and in Bologna he studied philosophy, theology, law and mathematics. His mathematics professor in Rome was Bonaventura Cavalieri and in Bologna his mathematics professor was Benedetto Castelli. He became a priest in 1643, the year he returned home and soon became abbot of the Benedictine abbey of St. Cosmas and Damian on the island of Pa\u0161man, canon of cathedral choir in Dubrovnik and Dubrovnik deputy Archbishop. After a private trip to Rome he remained there until his death as the official diplomatic representative of the Dubrovnik Republic to the Holy See. Since 1682 he was the head of the Vatican Library.\u000a\u000aGradi\u0107 was a polymath. He cooperated with the historian Joannes Lucius in defending the honor and reputation of their native country of unjust attacks of some Italian and French writers, translated classical authors, wrote a biography of the Dubrovnik writer Junije Palmoti\u0107 and a poem about the earthquake in Dubrovnik. In the literary and scientific circle of pope Alexander VII and Queen Christina of Sweden Gradi\u0107 discussed scientific and philosophical issues.\u000aHis philosophical works are written in the spirit of Aristotelianism and scholasticism. Gradi\u0107 was a member of the Royal Academy in Padua, having correspondence with many notable Europeans. He described the disastrous earthquake in Dubrovnik in 1667 in Latin verses and organized help from all over Europe for the devastated city.\u000aAlong with philosophy, he engaged in mathematics, physics, astronomy, literature and diplomacy. In mathematics, he dealt with Galileo's paradox. This work went unnoticed and was even unknown to Roger Joseph Boscovich who was a professor of mathematics at the Collegium Romanum where a century before Gradi\u0107 had been an alumnus. In his only printed mathematical treatise De loco Galilaei quo punctum lineae aequale pronuntiat published in the collection Dissertationes physico-mathematicae quatuor he disputed the concept of indivisible and developed a series of ideas en route to infinitesimal method. He was solving many mathematical problems which are left in his own inheritance and correspondence with other mathematicians as well, including those of Ghetaldus such as the first problem from Ghetaldus' work Apollonius redivivus. In scientific correspondence with Giovanni Alfonso Borelli and Honoré Fabri he published works dealing with the natural causes of motion and the laws of acceleration and falling bodies.

aVCreation science or scientific creationism is a branch of creationism that claims to provide scientific support for the Genesis creation narrative in the Book of Genesis and disprove or reexplain the scientific facts, theories and scientific paradigms about geology, cosmology, biological evolution, archeology, history, and linguistics.\u000aThe overwhelming consensus of the scientific community is that creation science fails to produce scientific hypotheses, and courts have ruled that it is a religious, not a scientific, view. It fails to qualify as a science because it lacks empirical support, supplies no tentative hypotheses, and resolves to describe natural history in terms of scientifically untestable supernatural causes. Creation science is a pseudoscientific attempt to map the Bible into scientific facts. It is viewed by professional biologists as unscholarly, and even as a dishonest and misguided sham, with extremely harmful educational consequences.\u000aCreation science began in the 1960s, as a fundamentalist Christian effort in the United States to prove Biblical inerrancy and nullify the scientific evidence for evolution. It has since developed a sizable religious following in the United States, with creation science ministries branching worldwide. The main ideas in creation science are: the belief in "creation ex nihilo" (Latin: out of nothing); the conviction that the Earth was created within the last 6,000\u201310,000 years; the belief that mankind and other life on Earth were created as distinct fixed "baraminological" kinds; and the idea that fossils found in geological strata were deposited during a cataclysmic flood which completely covered the entire Earth. As a result, creation science also challenges the commonly accepted geologic and astrophysical theories for the age and origins of the Earth and Universe, which creationists acknowledge are irreconcilable to the account in the Book of Genesis. Creation science proponents often refer to the theory of evolution as "Darwinism" or as "Darwinian evolution."\u000aThe creation science texts and curricula that first emerged in the 1960s focused upon concepts derived from a literal interpretation of the Bible and were overtly religious in nature, most notably linking Noah's flood in the Biblical Genesis account to the geological and fossil record in a system termed flood geology. These works attracted little notice beyond the schools and congregations of conservative fundamental and Evangelical Christians until the 1970s when its followers challenged the teaching of evolution in the public schools and other venues in the United States, bringing it to the attention of the public-at-large and the scientific community. Many school boards and lawmakers were persuaded to include the teaching of creation science alongside evolution in the science curriculum. Creation science texts and curricula used in churches and Christian schools were revised to eliminate their Biblical and theological references, and less explicitly sectarian versions of creation science education were introduced in public schools in Louisiana, Arkansas, and other regions in the United States.\u000aThe 1982 ruling in McLean v. Arkansas found that creation science fails to meet the essential characteristics of science and that its chief intent is to advance a particular religious view. The teaching of creation science in public schools in the United States effectively ended in 1987 following the United States Supreme Court decision in Edwards v. Aguillard. The court affirmed that a statute requiring the teaching of creation science alongside evolution when evolution is taught in Louisiana public schools was unconstitutional because its sole true purpose was to advance a particular religious belief.\u000aIn response to this ruling, drafts of the creation science school textbook Of Pandas and People were edited to change references of creation to intelligent design before its publication in 1989. The intelligent design movement promoted this version. Requiring intelligent design to be taught in public school science classes was found to be unconstitutional in the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District federal court case.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Beliefs and activities ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Religious basis ===\u000aCreation science is based largely upon chapters 1\u201311 of the Book of Genesis. These describe how God calls the world into existence through the power of speech ("And God said, Let there be light," etc.) in six days, calls all the animals and plants into existence, and molds the first man from clay and the first woman from a rib taken from the man's side; a worldwide flood destroys all life except for Noah and his family and representatives of the animals, and Noah becomes the ancestor of the 70 "nations" of the world; the nations live together until the incident of the Tower of Babel, when God disperses them and gives them their different languages. Creation science attempts to explain history and science within the span of Biblical chronology, which places the initial act of creation some six thousand years ago.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Modern religious affiliations ===\u000aMost creation science proponents hold fundamentalist or Evangelical Christian beliefs in Biblical literalism or Biblical inerrancy, as opposed to the higher criticism supported by Liberal Christianity in the Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy. However, there are also examples of Islamic and Jewish scientific creationism that conform to the accounts of creation as recorded in their religious doctrines.\u000aThe Seventh-day Adventist Church has a history of support for creation science. This dates back to George McCready Price, an active Seventh-day Adventist who developed views of flood geology, which formed the basis of creation science. This work was continued by the Geoscience Research Institute, an official institute of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, located on its Loma Linda University campus in California.\u000aCreation science is generally rejected by the Church of England as well as the Roman Catholic Church. The Pontifical Gregorian University has officially discussed intelligent design as a "cultural phenomenon" without scientific elements. The Church of England's official website cites Charles Darwin's local work assisting people in his religious parish.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Views on science ===\u000a\u000aCreation science rejects evolution's theory of the common descent of all living things on the Earth. Instead, it asserts that the field of evolutionary biology is itself pseudoscientific or even a religion. Creationists argue instead for a system called baraminology, which considers the living world to be descended from uniquely created kinds or "baramins."\u000aCreation science incorporates the concept of catastrophism to reconcile current landforms and fossil distributions with Biblical interpretations, proposing the remains resulted from successive cataclysmic events, such as a worldwide flood and subsequent ice age. It rejects one of the fundamental principles of modern geology (and of modern science generally), uniformitarianism, which applies the same physical and geological laws observed on the Earth today to interpret the Earth's geological history.\u000aSometimes creationists attack other scientific concepts, like the Big Bang cosmological model or methods of scientific dating based upon radioactive decay. Young Earth creationists also reject current estimates of the age of the universe and the age of the Earth, arguing for creationist cosmologies with timescales much shorter than those determined by modern physical cosmology and geological science, typically less than 10,000 years.\u000aThe scientific community has overwhelmingly rejected the ideas put forth in creation science as lying outside the boundaries of a legitimate science. The foundational premises underlying scientific creationism disqualify it as a science because the answers to all inquiry therein are preordained to conform to Bible doctrine, and because that inquiry is constructed upon theories which are not empirically testable in nature. Scientists also deem creation science's attacks against biological evolution to be without scientific merit. Those views of the scientific community were accepted in two significant court decisions in the 1980s which found the field of creation science to be a religious mode of inquiry, not a scientific one.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aThe teaching of evolution was gradually introduced into more and more public high school textbooks in the United States after 1900, but in the aftermath of the First World War the growth of fundamentalist Christianity gave rise to a creationist opposition to such teaching. Legislation prohibiting the teaching of evolution was passed in certain regions, most notably Tennessee's Butler Act of 1925. The Soviet Union's successful launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 sparked national concern that the science education in public schools was outdated. In 1958, the United States passed National Defense Education Act which introduced new education guidelines for science instruction. With federal grant funding, the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) drafted new standards for the public schools' science textbooks which included the teaching of evolution. Almost half the nation's high schools were using textbooks based on the guidelines of the BSCS soon after they were published in 1963. The Tennessee legislature did not repeal the Butler Act until 1967.\u000aCreation science (dubbed "scientific creationism" at the time) emerged as an organized movement during the 1960s. It was strongly influenced by the earlier work of armchair geologist George McCready Price who wrote works such as The New Geology (1923) to advance what he termed "new catastrophism" and dispute the current geological time frames and explanations of geologic history. Price's work was cited at the Scopes Trial of 1925, yet although he frequently solicited feedback from geologists and other scientists, they consistently disparaged his work. Price's "new catastrophism" also went largely unnoticed by other creationists until its revival with the 1961 publication of The Genesis Flood by John C. Whitcomb and Henry M. Morris, a work which quickly became an important text on the issue to fundamentalist Christians and expanded the field of creation science beyond critiques of geology into biology and cosmology as well. Soon after its publication, a movement was underway to have the subject taught in United States' public schools.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Court determinations ===\u000aThe various state laws prohibiting teaching of evolution were overturned in 1968 when the United States Supreme Court ruled in Epperson v. Arkansas such laws violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. This ruling inspired a new creationist movement to promote laws requiring that schools give balanced treatment to creation science when evolution is taught. The 1981 Arkansas Act 590 was one such law that carefully detailed the principles of creation science that were to receive equal time in public schools alongside evolutionary principles. The act defined creation science as follows:\u000a"'Creation-science' means the scientific evidences for creation and inferences from those evidences. Creation-science includes the scientific evidences and related inferences that indicate:\u000a\u000aSudden creation of the universe, and, in particular, life, from nothing;\u000aThe insufficiency of mutation and natural selection in bringing about development of all living kinds from a single organism;\u000aChanges only with fixed limits of originally created kinds of plants and animals;\u000aSeparate ancestry for man and apes;\u000aExplanation of the earth's geology by catastrophism, including the occurrence of worldwide flood; and\u000aA relatively recent inception of the earth and living kinds."\u000a\u000aThis legislation was examined in McLean v. Arkansas, and the ruling handed down on January 5, 1982, concluded that creation-science as defined in the act "is simply not science". The judgement defined the following as essential characteristics of science:\u000a\u000aIt is guided by natural law;\u000aIt has to be explanatory by reference to nature law;\u000aIt is testable against the empirical world;\u000aIts conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\u000aIt is falsifiable.\u000a\u000aThe court ruled that creation science failed to meet these essential characteristics and identified specific reasons. After examining the key concepts from creation science, the court found:\u000a\u000aSudden creation "from nothing" calls upon a supernatural intervention, not natural law, and is neither testable nor falsifiable\u000aObjections in creation science that mutation and natural selection are insufficient to explain common origins was an incomplete negative generalization\u000a'Kinds' are not scientific classifications, and creation science's claims of an outer limit to the evolutionary change possible of species are not explained scientifically or by natural law\u000aSeparate ancestry of man and apes is an assertion rather than scientific explanation, and did not derive from any scientific fact or theory\u000aCatastrophism, including its identification of the worldwide flood, failed as a science\u000a"Relatively recent inception" was the product of religious readings and had no scientific meaning, and was neither the product of, nor explainable by, natural law; nor is it tentative\u000a\u000aThe court further noted that no recognized scientific journal had published any article espousing the creation science theory as described in the Arkansas law, and stated that the testimony presented by defense attributing the absence to censorship was not credible.\u000aIn its ruling, the court wrote that for any theory to qualify as scientific, the theory must be tentative, and open to revision or abandonment as new facts come to light. It wrote that any methodology which begins with an immutable conclusion which cannot be revised or rejected, regardless of the evidence, is not a scientific theory. The court found that creation science does not culminate in conclusions formed from scientific inquiry, but instead begins with the conclusion, one taken from a literal wording of the Book of Genesis, and seeks only scientific evidence to support it.\u000aThe law in Arkansas adopted the same two-model approach as that put forward by the Institute for Creation Research, one allowing only two possible explanations for the origins of life and existence of man, plants and animals: it was either the work of a creator or it was not. Scientific evidence that failed to support the theory of evolution was posed as necessarily scientific evidence in support of creationism, but in its judgment the court ruled this approach to be no more than a "contrived dualism which has not scientific factual basis or legitimate educational purpose."\u000aThe judge concluded that "Act 590 is a religious crusade, coupled with a desire to conceal this fact," and that it violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.\u000aThe decision was not appealed to a higher court, but had a powerful influence on subsequent rulings. Louisiana's 1982 Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act, authored by State Senator Bill P. Keith, judged in the 1987 United States Supreme Court case Edwards v. Aguillard, and was handed a similar ruling. It found the law to require the balanced teaching of creation science with evolution had a particular religious purpose and was therefore unconstitutional.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Intelligent design splits off ===\u000aIn 1984, The Mystery of Life's Origin was first published. It was co-authored by chemist and creationist Charles B. Thaxton with Walter L. Bradley and Roger L. Olsen, the foreword written by Dean H. Kenyon, and sponsored by the Christian-based Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE). The work presented scientific arguments against current theories of abiogenesis and offered an hypothesis of special creation instead. While the focus of creation science had until that time centered primarily on the criticism of the fossil evidence for evolution and validation of the creation myth of the Bible, this new work posed the question whether science reveals that even the simplest living systems were far too complex to have developed by natural, unguided processes.\u000aKenyon later co-wrote with creationist Percival Davis a book intended as a "scientific brief for creationism" to use as a supplement to public high school biology textbooks. Thaxton was enlisted as the book's editor, and the book received publishing support from the FTE. Prior to its release, the 1987 Supreme Court ruling in Edwards v. Aguillard barred the teaching of creation science and creationism in public school classrooms. The book, originally titled Biology and Creation but renamed Of Pandas and People, was released in 1989 and became the first published work to promote the anti-evolutionist design argument under the name intelligent design. The contents of the book later became a focus of evidence in the federal court case, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, when a group of parents filed suit to halt the teaching of intelligent design in Dover, Pennsylvania, public schools. School board officials there had attempted to include Of Pandas and People in their biology classrooms and testimony given during the trial revealed the book was originally written as a creationist text but following the adverse decision in the Supreme Court it underwent simple cosmetic editing to remove the explicit allusions to "creation" or "creator," and replace them instead with references to "design" or "designer."\u000aBy the mid-1990s, intelligent design had become a separate movement. The creation science movement is distinguished from the intelligent design movement, or neo-creationism, because most advocates of creation science accept scripture as a literal and inerrant historical account, and their primary goal is to corroborate the scriptural account through the use of science. In contrast, as a matter of principle, neo-creationism eschews references to scripture altogether in its polemics and stated goals (see Wedge strategy). By so doing, intelligent design proponents have attempted to succeed where creation science has failed in securing a place in public school science curricula. Carefully avoiding any reference to the identity of the intelligent designer as God in their public arguments, intelligent design proponents sought to reintroduce the creationist ideas into science classrooms while sidestepping the First Amendment's prohibition against religious infringement. However, the intelligent design curriculum was struck down as a violation of the Establishment Clause in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, the judge in the case ruling "that ID is nothing less than the progeny of creationism."\u000aToday, creation science as an organized movement is primarily centered within the United States. Creation science organizations are also known in other countries, most notably Creation Ministries International which was founded (under the name Creation Science Foundation) in Australia.\u000aProponents are usually aligned with a Christian denomination, primarily with those characterized as evangelical, conservative, or fundamentalist. While creationist movements also exist in Islam and Judaism, these movements do not use the phrase creation science to describe their beliefs.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Issues ==\u000aCreation science has its roots in the work of young Earth creationist George McCready Price disputing modern science's account of natural history, focusing particularly on geology and its concept of uniformitarianism, and his efforts instead to furnish an alternative empirical explanation of observable phenomena which was compatible with strict Biblical literalism. Price's work was later discovered by civil engineer Henry M. Morris, who is now considered to be the father of creation science. Morris and later creationists expanded the scope with attacks against the broad spectrum scientific findings that point to the antiquity of the Universe and common ancestry among species, including growing body of evidence from the fossil record, absolute dating techniques, and cosmogony.\u000aThe proponents of creation science often say that they are concerned with religious and moral questions as well as natural observations and predictive hypotheses. Many state that their opposition to scientific evolution is primarily based on religion.\u000aThe overwhelming majority of scientists are in agreement that the claims of science are necessarily limited to those that develop from natural observations and experiments which can be replicated and substantiated by other scientists, and that claims made by creation science do not meet those criteria. Duane Gish, a prominent creation science proponent, has similarly claimed, "We do not know how the creator created, what processes He used, for He used processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural universe. This is why we refer to creation as special creation. We cannot discover by scientific investigation anything about the creative processes used by the Creator." But he also makes the same claim against science's evolutionary theory, maintaining that on the subject of origins, scientific evolution is a religious theory which cannot be validated by science.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Metaphysical assumptions ===\u000aCreation science makes the a priori metaphysical assumption that there exists a creator of the life whose origin is being examined. Christian creation science holds that the description of creation is given in the Bible, that the Bible is inerrant in this description (and elsewhere), and therefore empirical scientific evidence must correspond with that description. Creationists also view the preclusion of all supernatural explanations within the sciences as a doctrinaire commitment to exclude the supreme being and miracles. They claim this to be the motivating factor in science's acceptance of Darwinism, a term used in creation science to refer to evolutionary biology which is also often used as a disparagement. Critics argue that creation science is religious rather than scientific because it stems from faith in a religious text rather than by the application of the scientific method. The United States National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has stated unequivocally, "Evolution pervades all biological phenomena. To ignore that it occurred or to classify it as a form of dogma is to deprive the student of the most fundamental organizational concept in the biological sciences. No other biological concept has been more extensively tested and more thoroughly corroborated than the evolutionary history of organisms." Anthropologist Eugenie Scott has noted further, "Religious opposition to evolution propels antievolutionism. Although antievolutionists pay lip service to supposed scientific problems with evolution, what motivates them to battle its teaching is apprehension over the implications of evolution for religion."\u000aCreation science advocates argue that scientific theories of the origins of the Universe, Earth, and life are rooted in a priori presumptions of methodological naturalism and uniformitarianism, each of which is disputed. In some areas of science such as chemistry, meteorology or medicine, creation science proponents do not challenge the application of naturalistic or uniformitarian assumptions. Traditionally, creation science advocates have singled out those scientific theories judged to be in conflict with held religious beliefs, and it is against those theories that they concentrate their efforts.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Religious criticism ===\u000aSome mainstream Christian churches criticize creation science on theological grounds, asserting either that religious faith alone should be a sufficient basis for belief in the truth of creation, or that efforts to prove the Genesis account of creation on scientific grounds are inherently futile because reason is subordinate to faith and cannot thus be used to prove it.\u000aMany Christian theologies, including Liberal Christianity, consider the Genesis creation narrative to be a poetic and allegorical work rather than a literal history, and many Christian churches\u2014including the Roman Catholic, Anglican and the more liberal denominations of the Lutheran, Methodist, Congregationalist and Presbyterian faiths\u2014have either rejected creation science outright or are ambivalent to it. Belief in non-literal interpretations of Genesis is often cited as going back to Saint Augustine.\u000aTheistic evolution and evolutionary creationism are theologies that reconcile belief in a creator with biological evolution. Each holds the view that there is a creator but that this creator has employed the natural force of evolution to unfold a divine plan. Religious representatives from faiths compatible with theistic evolution and evolutionary creationism have challenged the growing perception that belief in a creator is inconsistent with the acceptance of evolutionary theory. Spokespersons from the Catholic Church have specifically criticized biblical creationism for relying upon literal interpretations of biblical scripture as the basis for determining scientific fact.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Scientific criticism ===\u000a\u000aThe National Academy of Sciences states that "the claims of creation science lack empirical support and cannot be meaningfully tested" and that "creation science is in fact not science and should not be presented as such in science classes." According to Joyce Arthur writing for Skeptic magazine, the "creation 'science' movement gains much of its strength through the use of distortion and scientifically unethical tactics" and "seriously misrepresents the theory of evolution."\u000aScientists have considered the hypotheses proposed by creation science and have rejected them because of a lack of evidence. Furthermore, the claims of creation science do not refer to natural causes and cannot be subject to meaningful tests, so they do not qualify as scientific hypotheses. In 1987, the United States Supreme Court ruled that creationism is religion, not science, and cannot be advocated in public school classrooms. Most mainline Christian denominations have concluded that the concept of evolution is not at odds with their descriptions of creation and human origins.\u000aA summary of the objections to creation science by scientists follows:\u000aCreation science is not falsifiable: An idea or hypothesis is generally not considered to be in the realm of science unless it can be potentially disproved with certain experiments, this is the concept of falsifiability in science. The act of creation as defined in creation science is not falsifiable because no testable bounds can be imposed on the creator. In creation science, the creator is defined as limitless, with the capacity to create (or not), through fiat alone, infinite universes, not just one, and endow each one with its own unique, unimaginable and incomparable character. It is impossible to disprove a claim when that claim as defined encompasses every conceivable contingency.\u000aCreation science violates the principle of parsimony: Parsimony favours those explanations which rely on the fewest assumptions. Scientists prefer explanations which are consistent with known and supported facts and evidence and require the fewest assumptions to fill remaining gaps. Many of the alternative claims made in creation science retreat from simpler scientific explanations and introduce more complications and conjecture into the equation.\u000aCreation science is not, and cannot be, empirically or experimentally tested: Creationism posits supernatural causes which lie outside the realm of methodological naturalism and scientific experiment. Science can only test empirical, natural claims.\u000aCreation science is not correctable, dynamic, tentative or progressive: Creation science adheres to a fixed and unchanging premise or "absolute truth," the "word of God," which is not open to change. Any evidence that runs contrary to that truth must be disregarded. In science, all claims are tentative, they are forever open to challenge, and must be discarded or adjusted when the weight of evidence demands it.\u000aBy invoking claims of "abrupt appearance" of species as a miraculous act, creation science is unsuited for the tools and methods demanded by science, and it cannot be considered scientific in the way that the term "science" is currently defined. Scientists and science writers commonly characterize creation science as a pseudoscience.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Historical, philosophical, and sociological criticism ===\u000aHistorically, the debate of whether creationism is compatible with science can be traced back to 1874, the year science historian John William Draper published his History of the Conflict between Religion and Science. In it Draper portrayed the entire history of scientific development as a war against religion. This presentation of history was propagated further by followers such as Andrew Dickson White in his two-volume A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (1896). Their conclusions have been disputed.\u000aIn the United States, the principal focus of creation science advocates is on the government-supported public school systems, which are prohibited by the Establishment Clause from promoting specific religions. Historical communities have argued that Biblical translations contain many translation errors and errata, and therefore that the use of biblical literalism in creation science is self-contradictory.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Areas of study ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Creationist biology ===\u000a\u000aCreationist biology centers on an idea derived from Genesis that states that life was created by God, in a finite number of "created kinds," rather than through biological evolution from a common ancestor. Creationists consider that any observable speciation descends from these distinctly created kinds through inbreeding, deleterious mutations and other genetic mechanisms. Whereas evolutionary biologists and creationists share similar views of microevolution, creationists disagree that the process of macroevolution can explain common ancestry among organisms far beyond the level of common species. Creationists contend that there is no empirical evidence for new plant or animal species, and deny fossil evidence has ever been found documenting the process.\u000aPopular arguments against evolution have changed since the publishing of Henry M. Morris' first book on the subject, Scientific Creationism (1974), but some consistent themes remain: that missing links or gaps in the fossil record are proof against evolution; that the increased complexity of organisms over time through evolution is not possible due to the law of increasing entropy; that it is impossible that the mechanism of natural selection could account for common ancestry; and that evolutionary theory is untestable. The origin of the human species is particularly hotly contested; the fossil remains of purported hominid ancestors are not considered by advocates of creation biology to be evidence for a speciation event involving Homo sapiens. Creationists also assert that early hominids, are either apes, or humans.\u000aRichard Dawkins has explained evolution as "a theory of gradual, incremental change over millions of years, which starts with something very simple and works up along slow, gradual gradients to greater complexity," and described the existing fossil record as entirely consistent with that process. Biologists emphasize that transitional gaps between those fossils recovered are to be expected, that the existence of any such gaps cannot be invoked to disprove evolution, and that instead the fossil evidence that could be used to disprove the theory would be those fossils which are found and which are entirely inconsistent with what can be predicted or anticipated by the evolutionary model. One example given by Dawkins was, "If there were a single hippo or rabbit in the Precambrian, that would completely blow evolution out of the water. None have ever been found."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Earth sciences and geophysics ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Flood geology ====\u000a\u000aFlood geology is a concept based on the belief that most of Earth's geological record was formed by the Great Flood described in the story of Noah's Ark. Fossils and fossil fuels are believed to have formed from animal and plant matter which was buried rapidly during this flood, while submarine canyons are explained as having formed during a rapid runoff from the continents at the end of the flood. Sedimentary strata are also claimed to have been predominantly laid down during or after Noah's flood and orogeny. Flood geology is a variant of catastrophism and is contrasted with geological science in that it rejects standard geological principles such as uniformitarianism and radiometric dating. For example, the Creation Research Society argues that "uniformitarianism is wishful thinking."\u000aGeologists conclude that no evidence for such a flood is observed in the preserved rock layers and moreover that such a flood is physically impossible, given the current layout of land masses. For instance, since Mount Everest currently is approximately 8.8 kilometres in elevation and the Earth's surface area is 510,065,600 km2, the volume of water required to cover Mount Everest to a depth of 15 cubits (6.8 m), as indicated by Genesis 7:20, would be 4.6 billion cubic kilometres. Measurements of the amount of precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere have yielded results indicating that condensing all water vapor in a column of atmosphere would produce liquid water with a depth ranging between zero and approximately 70mm, depending on the date and the location of the column. Nevertheless, there continue to be many adherents to flood geology, and in recent years new theories have been introduced such as catastrophic plate tectonics and catastrophic orogeny.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Radiometric dating ====\u000aCreationists point to experiments they have performed, which they claim demonstrate that 1.5 billion years of nuclear decay took place over a short period of time, from which they infer that "billion-fold speed-ups of nuclear decay" have occurred, a massive violation of the principle that radioisotope decay rates are constant, a core principle underlying nuclear physics generally, and radiometric dating in particular.\u000aThe scientific community points to numerous flaws in the creationists' experiments, to the fact that their results have not been accepted for publication by any peer-reviewed scientific journal, and to the fact that the creationist scientists conducting them were untrained in experimental geochronology. They have also been criticised for widely publicising the results of their research as successful despite their own admission of insurmountable problems with their hypothesis.\u000aThe constancy of the decay rates of isotopes is well supported in science. Evidence for this constancy includes the correspondences of date estimates taken from different radioactive isotopes as well as correspondences with non-radiometric dating techniques such as dendrochronology, ice core dating, and historical records. Although scientists have noted slight increases in the decay rate for isotopes subject to extreme pressures, those differences were too small to significantly impact date estimates. The constancy of the decay rates is also governed by first principles in quantum mechanics, wherein any deviation in the rate would require a change in the fundamental constants. According to these principles, a change in the fundamental constants could not influence different elements uniformly, and a comparison between each of the elements' resulting unique chronological timescales would then give inconsistent time estimates.\u000aIn refutation of young Earth claims of inconstant decay rates affecting the reliability of radiometric dating, Roger C. Wiens, a physicist specializing in isotope dating states:\u000a\u000aThere are only three quite technical instances where a half-life changes, and these do not affect the dating methods:\u000a\u000aOnly one technical exception occurs under terrestrial conditions, and this is not for an isotope used for dating. ... The artificially-produced isotope, beryllium-7 has been shown to change by up to 1.5%, depending on its chemical environment. ... [H]eavier atoms are even less subject to these minute changes, so the dates of rocks made by electron-capture decays would only be off by at most a few hundredths of a percent.\u000a... Another case is material inside of stars, which is in a plasma state where electrons are not bound to atoms. In the extremely hot stellar environment, a completely different kind of decay can occur. 'Bound-state beta decay' occurs when the nucleus emits an electron into a bound electronic state close to the nucleus. ... All normal matter, such as everything on Earth, the Moon, meteorites, etc. has electrons in normal positions, so these instances never apply to rocks, or anything colder than several hundred thousand degrees. ...\u000aThe last case also involves very fast-moving matter. It has been demonstrated by atomic clocks in very fast spacecraft. These atomic clocks slow down very slightly (only a second or so per year) as predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity. No rocks in our solar system are going fast enough to make a noticeable change in their dates.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Radiohaloes ====\u000a\u000aIn the 1970s, young Earth creationist Robert V. Gentry proposed that radiohaloes in certain granites represented evidence for the Earth being created instantaneously rather than gradually. This idea has been criticized by physicists and geologists on many grounds including that the rocks Gentry studied were not primordial and that the radionuclides in question need not have been in the rocks initially.\u000aThomas A. Baillieul, a geologist and retired senior environmental scientist with the United States Department of Energy, disputed Gentry's claims in an article entitled, "'Polonium Haloes' Refuted: A Review of 'Radioactive Halos in a Radio-Chronological and Cosmological Perspective' by Robert V. Gentry." Baillieul noted that Gentry was a physicist with no background in geology and given the absence of this background, Gentry had misrepresented the geological context from which the specimens were collected. Additionally, he noted that Gentry relied on research from the beginning of the 20th century, long before radioisotopes were thoroughly understood; that his assumption that a polonium isotope caused the rings was speculative; and that Gentry falsely argued that the half-life of radioactive elements varies with time. Gentry claimed that Baillieul could not publish his criticisms in a reputable scientific journal, although some of Baillieul's criticisms rested on work previously published in reputable scientific journals.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Astronomy and cosmology ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Creationist cosmologies ====\u000a\u000aSeveral attempts have been made by creationists to construct a cosmology consistent with a young Universe rather than the standard cosmological age of the universe, based on the belief that Genesis describes the creation of the Universe as well as the Earth. The primary challenge for young-universe cosmologies is that the accepted distances in the Universe require millions or billions of years for light to travel to Earth (the "starlight problem"). An older creationist idea, proposed by creationist astronomer Barry Setterfield, is that the speed of light has decayed in the history of the Universe. More recently, creationist physicist Russell Humphreys has proposed a hypothesis called "white hole cosmology" which suggests that the Universe expanded out of a white hole less than 10,000 years ago; the apparent age of the universe results from relativistic effects. Humphreys' theory is advocated by creationist organisations such as Answers in Genesis; however because the predictions of Humphreys' cosmology conflict with current observations, it is not accepted by the scientific community.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Planetology ====\u000a\u000aVarious claims are made by creationists concerning alleged evidence that the age of the Solar System is of the order of thousands of years, in contrast to the scientifically accepted age of 4.6 billion years. It is commonly argued that the number of comets in the Solar System is much higher than would be expected given its supposed age. Creationist astronomers express scepticism about the existence of the Kuiper belt and Oort cloud. Creationists also argue that the recession of the Moon from the Earth is incompatible with either the Moon or the Earth being billions of years old. These claims have been refuted by planetologists.\u000aIn response to increasing evidence suggesting that Mars once possessed a wetter climate, some creationists have proposed that the global flood affected not only the Earth but also Mars and other planets. People who support this claim include creationist astronomer Wayne Spencer and Russell Humphreys.\u000aAn ongoing problem for creationists is the presence of impact craters on nearly all Solar System objects, which is consistent with scientific explanations of solar system origins but creates insuperable problems for young Earth claims. Creationists Harold Slusher and Richard Mandock, along with Glenn Morton (who later repudiated this claim) asserted that impact craters on the Moon are subject to rock flow, and so cannot be more than a few thousand years old. While some creationist astronomers assert that different phases of meteoritic bombardment of the Solar System occurred during creation week and during the subsequent Great Flood, others regard this as unsupported by the evidence and call for further research.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Groups ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Proponents ===\u000aAnswers in Genesis\u000aCreation Ministries International\u000aCreation Research Society\u000aGeoscience Research Institute\u000aInstitute for Creation Research\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Critics ===\u000aAmerican Museum of Natural History\u000aNational Science Teachers Association\u000aNational Center for Science Education\u000aNo Answers in Genesis\u000aNational Academy of Sciences\u000aScientific American\u000aThe Skeptic's Dictionary\u000aTalk.reason\u000aTalkOrigins Archive\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Proponents ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aNotable creationist museums in the United States:\u000aCreation Evidence Museum, located in Glen Rose, Texas\u000aCreation Museum, located in Petersburg, Kentucky\u000aHuman Timeline (Interactive) \u2013 Smithsonian, National Museum of Natural History (August 2016).

aVThe Bonstelle Theatre is a theater operated by Wayne State University, and located at 3424 Woodward Avenue (the southeast corner of Woodward and Eliot) in the Midtown Woodward Historic District of Detroit, Michigan. It was originally built in 1902 as the Temple Beth-El, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Construction ==\u000aWhen Rabbi Leo M. Franklin first began leading services at Detroit's Temple Beth El in 1899, he felt that the construction of a new temple building on Detroit's "Piety Row" stretch of Woodward would increase the visibility and prestige of Detroit's Jewish community. Accordingly, in October 1900, the congregation held a special meeting at which it was decided to build a new temple. A site for the new temple was purchased in April of the next year, and Albert Kahn, a member of the congregation, was hired to design the building. Groundbreaking began on November 25, 1901, with the ceremonial cornerstone laid on April 23, 1902. The first services were held in the chapel on January 24, 1903, and the formal dedication was held on September 18\u201319 of the same year.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Building ==\u000aThe temple is a Beaux-Arts structure influenced primarily by Roman and Greek temples. Sobocinski cites the Pantheon in Rome for comparison. There is a prominent dome over the main area of the temple, with gabled wings on the north and south. A pedimented extension on the front once extended into a porch; the front section of the building was lost when Woodward was widened.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Later use ==\u000aWhen the Temple Beth El congregation built another building farther north along Woodward in 1922, they sold the building at Woodward and Eliot to Jessie Bonstelle for $500,000. Bonstelle hired architect C. Howard Crane to convert the building into a theater, naming the resulting building the Bonstelle Playhouse. In 1928, the Bonstelle Playhouse became the Detroit Civic Theatre, and in the 1930s became the Mayfair Motion Picture Theater. In 1951, Wayne State University rented the building as a performance space for its theater company, and purchased it outright in 1956, renaming it the Bonstelle Theatre in honor of Jessie Bonstelle.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Gallery ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aHistory of the Jews in Metro Detroit\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aHill, Eric J. and John Gallagher (2002).

aVObed Chukwuma Ariri (born April 4, 1956) is a Nigerian-born former placekicker of American football in the National Football League for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Washington Redskins. He also played in the United States Football League for the Washington Federals and in the Arena Football League for the Miami Hooters. Ariri was born in Nigeria, and his middle name Chukwuma means "God Only Knows". He became a skilled soccer player and was scouted by Clemson University's soccer coach Ibrahim M. Ibrahim. After watching him play in Nigeria, Ibrahim offered Ariri a soccer scholarship to Clemson on the spot. He is distinguished as being the first Nigerian to play in the National Football League.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early career ==\u000aAriri was enrolled at Clemson in 1977 when Clemson football coach Charlie Pell was in dire need of a kicker. Dr. Ibrahim allowed Ariri to try out only if he agreed to continue to play soccer. Pell agreed, and Ariri went on to nail every attempt thus securing his place as the kicker for the Tigers. His scholarship was shifted to football and Pell insisted that Obed forget about soccer. Ariri never kicked a football until he was at Clemson.\u000aHe was so popular in campus during his Senior year that "Obed Ariri for the Heisman Trophy" bumper stickers were made up.\u000aIn 1979 Ariri was granted permission to play in the 1979 NCAA Division I National Soccer Championships at Tampa Stadium in Tampa, Florida. The Tigers lost 3-2 to Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. Ariri's performance during the game led to a job offer with the Chicago Sting of the North American Soccer League, where he made four appearances during the 1980 season.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Professional career ==\u000aAriri was drafted in the seventh round of the 1981 NFL Draft by the Baltimore Colts but was cut from the team days before the season. He was on the initial roster of the USFL's Washington Federals but did not last the entire season due to inconsistency and poor performance. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers acquired Obed in the 1984 pre-season but was waived before final cuts. After kicker Bill Capece flopped in the final Buccaneer pre-season game, Ariri was hired in time for the start of the regular season and he was their regular kicker that season, only to be released during the 1985 training camp. He was nicknamed the "Automatic African" by his teammates.\u000a1983 - Washington Federals (USFL)\u000a1984 - Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u000a1987 - Washington Redskins (strike replacement player)\u000a1994 - Miami Hooters (Arena Football League)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Honors ==\u000aSet 6 NCAA kicking records and tied another 3\u000aFirst Buccaneer to kick (3) 40 yard-plus field goals in a game\u000a1977 Made the longest field goal in Clemson history against Wake Forest (57 yards)\u000a1978 Made the longest field goal in Gator Bowl history (47 yards)\u000a1980 NCAA 1st Team All-American\u000a1998 Inducted into the Clemson Hall of Fame\u000a\u000a\u000a== Legacy ==\u000aYoung Nigerian soccer player Donald Igwebuike had idolized Ariri back in Nigeria.

aVThe 2014 Japanese Grand Prix (formally the 2014 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 5 October 2014 at the Suzuka Circuit in Suzuka, Mie. It was the fifteenth race of the 2014 FIA Formula One World Championship, and the 30th Japanese Grand Prix held as part of the Formula One World Championship. The 44-lap race was won by Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton, who started from second position. His teammate, Nico Rosberg, finished second and Red Bull Racing driver Sebastian Vettel came in third. It was Hamilton's eighth victory of the season, his first at Suzuka and the 30th of his Formula One career.\u000aHeavy rain from Typhoon Phanfone made the track surface wet and reduced visibility. Starting from behind the safety car, the race was stopped after two laps and resumed 20 minutes later. Rosberg immediately fended off a passing manoeuvre by Hamilton heading into the first corner. His car then experienced oversteer, and Hamilton reduced the time deficit between them. Hamilton challenged Rosberg for the lead over the next four laps, before overtaking him on the 29th lap and pulling away.\u000aThe race was scheduled to run for 53 laps, but was brought to an end on the 46th lap (with the result counted back two laps) after an accident involving Jules Bianchi. Bianchi lost control of his Marussia at Dunlop Curve on the 43rd lap and collided with a tractor crane that was tending to Adrian Sutil's Sauber, which had spun off on the previous lap. Bianchi sustained severe head injuries in the accident, from which he died in his native France on 17 July 2015, thus becoming the first driver to die as a result of injuries sustained in a Formula One race since Ayrton Senna in 1994. The accident prompted Formula One's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), to investigate the incident with a ten-person panel in which it was determined there was no single cause that prompted the crash.\u000aThe victory allowed Hamilton to increase his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to ten points over Rosberg, with Daniel Ricciardo a distant third. Mercedes extended their advantage over Red Bull in the Constructors' Championship, and Williams remained ahead of Ferrari in the battle for third place with four races left in the season.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Report ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Background ===\u000a\u000aThe 2014 Japanese Grand Prix was the 15th of 19 scheduled races of the 2014 FIA Formula One World Championship, and the 30th running of the event as part of the Formula One World Championship. It was held on 5 October at the Suzuka Circuit in Suzuka, Mie. Suzuka Circuit is 5.807 kilometres (3.608 mi) long and consists of 18 turns. The event's official name was the 2014 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix, and it was scheduled to run for 53 laps.\u000aTyre supplier Pirelli brought four types of tyre to the race: two dry compounds (medium "options" and hard "primes") and two wet-weather compounds (intermediate and full wet). The medium tyres were identified by a white stripe on their side-walls, and the hard tyres were similarly identified in red. The drag reduction system (DRS) had one activation zone for the race, on the straight linking the final and first corners. The circuit underwent changes following the previous year's race; parts of the track between the 14th and 15th turns were resurfaced, TecPro barriers were installed on the inside after the exit of turn 15 and lamp posts near debris fences outside turns 13 and 14 were moved back.\u000aGoing into the race, Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton led the Drivers' Championship with 241 points, three ahead of teammate Nico Rosberg, with Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo third with 181. Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso was fourth with 133, followed by Ricciardo's teammate Sebastian Vettel with 124. Mercedes led the Constructors' Championship with 479 points, having won eleven of the previous fourteen races of the season, while Red Bull were second with 305 points, having won the other three races; they were followed by Williams (187), Ferrari (178) and Force India (117). Mercedes had to outscore Red Bull by 41 points to clinch the Constructors' title in Japan.\u000a\u000aDespite reclaiming the Drivers' Championship lead at the preceding Singapore Grand Prix, Hamilton said that he was not relieved because of the closeness of the race. He said that he would take Rosberg's race-by-race approach and was happy to be performing well. Hamilton, who had yet to win the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, set his sights on a victory at the circuit. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said that the championship was out of their reach, although he hoped further reliability problems with the Mercedes cars would prolong the battle. Horner ruled out team orders favouring one driver over the other. Rosberg said he was looking forward to the race, and his car's speed gave him hope for a good result.\u000aTyphoon Phanfone, classified as a category-four storm, was forecast to make landfall over the eastern Japanese coast on race day with heavy rain and winds of up to 240 kilometres per hour (150 mph). Although the storm was predicted to miss Suzuka, heavy rain from its northern edge was expected to drench the circuit. The Russian Grand Prix, scheduled for the following week, made it impossible for the Japanese Grand Prix to be postponed until Monday due to freight schedules to Russia for the teams' equipment. Bernie Ecclestone, owner of Formula One's commercial rights, raised the possibility of moving up the start time, but later said that the event would proceed as planned. The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) race director, Charlie Whiting, suggested to race organisers that the start time be moved and warned them that the race would not take place unless it was declared safe, but they refused. Honda, the owners of the track, reportedly rejected the start time change to allow spectators to arrive at the circuit in time for the start of the race. Whiting was also overruled by senior officials from the sport's governing body, who opposed the disruption of the event's worldwide television coverage.\u000aThere were driver changes for the race's first free practice session. Max Verstappen replaced Jean-Éric Vergne as part of his preparation for a full-time seat at Toro Rosso in 2015. Aged 17 years and three days, Verstappen was the youngest person in the history of the series to participate in a Formula One race weekend. Caterham confirmed that Roberto Merhi would replace Marcus Ericsson, and Kamui Kobayashi would drive in the race. Formula Renault 3.5 Series driver Will Stevens was announced as participating in the first practice session in Max Chilton's car, but a problem with paperwork sent to the FIA Contract Recognition Board due to an industrial action in Germany prevented him from driving.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Practice and qualifying sessions ===\u000a\u000aThree practice sessions \u2013 two on Friday and a third on Saturday \u2013 were held before the race on Sunday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Mercedes conducted race simulations to see how the cars would behave with a heavy fuel load. Rosberg was fastest in the first practice session with a lap time of one minute and 35.461 seconds, ahead of teammate Hamilton in second. Alonso was third-fastest, ahead of Valtteri Bottas and Kimi Räikkönen, with Kevin Magnussen, Ricciardo, Jenson Button, Vettel and Daniil Kvyat rounding out the top ten. Verstappen's run ended early when he pulled over to the side of the track at the S curves with smoke billowing from his engine because of a broken exhaust valve, while Merhi spun at turn 13, causing Bottas to swerve to avoid him.\u000aIn the second practice session, Hamilton set the fastest lap of the day at one minute and 35.078 seconds. Rosberg was second with Bottas third, followed by Button, Vettel and Räikkönen. The top ten was completed by Alonso, Magnussen, Kvyat and Ricciardo. Some cars went off the track; Ricciardo disrupted the session for eight minutes when an oversteer sent him into the barrier at turn 18. Kobayashi lost control of the rear of his Caterham at turn three, damaging his rear suspension and front wing, while Vergne stopped his car on the back straight after exiting the Spoon Curve with a fuel pump problem. Esteban Gutiérrez later lost control of his Sauber entering the Spoon Curve and crashed into the tyre barrier. Vergne stopped a second time with an electrical problem after exiting turn 14; this resulted in a second red flag, which brought the session to an early end due to limited time available. Rosberg recorded the fastest lap time of the third practice session at one minute and 33.228 seconds, ahead of Hamilton and Alonso. Felipe Massa was fourth-fastest, followed by Bottas and Ricciardo, with Magnussen, Vergne, Kvyat and Button completing the top ten. Hamilton drove quickly into the first turn but ran wide onto the run-off area and collided with the tyre barrier, damaging the left front quarter of his car, while Gutiérrez lost control of his car's rear at the exit of turn 15 but avoided crashing into the wall.\u000a\u000aSaturday afternoon's qualifying session was divided into three parts. The first part ran for 18 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 17th or below. The 107% rule was in effect during this part, requiring drivers to set a time within 107% of the fastest lap in order to qualify. The second part lasted 15 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 11th to 16th, before the third and final part determined the positions from pole position to tenth. Cars in the final qualifying session were not allowed to change tyres, using the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. Rosberg set the fastest time in the second and third parts of the session to clinch his eighth pole position of the season, the twelfth of his career and his first at Suzuka with a lap time of one minute and 32.506 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Hamilton, who recorded a lap time nearly two-tenths of a second slower than his teammate. Hamilton missed out on pole position when, on his final lap, he hit the chicane kerbing before accelerating too fast into the final corner. Williams teammates Bottas and Massa qualified third and fourth, and Alonso and Ricciardo took fifth and sixth. Mangnussen, whose mistakes on his quickest timed lap cost him time, took seventh. His McLaren teammate, Button, secured eighth and locked one of his tyres\u2014flat-spotting it and slowing his times. Vettel, struggling on corners due partially to Red Bull's use of wet tyres, took ninth, while Räikkönen rounded out the top ten qualifiers, encountering problems with his car's balance which prevented him from pushing hard.\u000aVergne was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session; his best lap time of one minute and 34.984 seconds was two seconds off Rosberg's pace in the second session. Because his team had changed his engine, he received a ten-place grid penalty, his sixth of the season. This promoted the Force India of Sergio Pérez to 11th position; the Mexican driver had encountered slower cars entering the final chicane, which forced him to reduce his speed and lose brake and tyre temperature. Kvyat's final timed lap was disrupted by slower cars; when he entered the first corner his tyres had not reached their optimum temperature, compromising his run and leaving him 12th. Nico Hülkenberg qualified 13th in the other Force India after he locked his tyres at the final chicane. Adrian Sutil progressed to the second qualifying session after making balance set-up changes, and took 14th in its closing seconds; his Sauber teammate, Gutiérrez, struggled with tyre temperature and was delayed by traffic on his out-lap, leaving him 15th. Pastor Maldonado failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, but Lotus installed a new engine (his sixth of the year) in his E22 chassis on Friday morning. Like Vergne, he incurred a ten-place grid penalty (carried over to the next race because he qualified within the top-ten bottom positions). His teammate, Romain Grosjean, took over 16th position and aimed to qualify higher; however, a change in wind direction prevented him from recording a faster lap time. Ericsson and Jules Bianchi started from 17th and 18th, with Kobayashi 19th and Vergne 20th. Chilton lost control of his Marussia's rear, causing him to start 21st.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Race ===\u000aThe race began at 15:00 Japan Standard Time (UTC+09:00). There was a large amount of standing water on the track, since Typhoon Phanfone had brought heavy rain to the area. The air temperature was 20 °C (68 °F), and the track temperature was 24 °C (75 °F). About 142,000 people attended the race. The standing water caused heavy spray and impaired visibility, and all cars used full wet tyres. The race began behind the safety car, with no formation lap; despite the slow speed, drivers struggled for grip on the wet surface. Ericsson lost control of his car after accelerating out of the final turn, spinning into the gravel trap; marshals pushed his car out of the gravel, enabling him to keep driving. Following complaints from Hamilton about poor visibility, the race was suspended after two laps. The cars drove back into the pit lane, lined up in grid formation and their engines were shut off. Several cars had their ride heights raised to make them less prone to aquaplaning on their underbody planks. The race was restarted 20 minutes later behind the safety car, after the rain eased. Alonso stopped his car with an electrical issue \u2013 possibly a short circuit from the wet conditions \u2013 to become the race's first retirement on lap 3. His departure promoted Ricciardo to fifth place, with Magnussen sixth and Button seventh.\u000a\u000aAlthough Hamilton became concerned about his Mercedes' brakes, he was told that it was a relatively minor sensor problem. He and Vergne reported that conditions had improved, but Vettel and Massa said that visibility remained poor. The safety car drove into the pit lane at the end of lap 9, and the cars were allowed to overtake. Button immediately made a pit stop to fit intermediate tyres. Hamilton unsuccessfully attempted to overtake Rosberg heading into the first corner, while Vettel tried to pass Magnussen going into the hairpin, also without success; he then ran wide at the Spoon Curve but remained on the track. Pérez overtook Kvyat to claim ninth position on the lap. At the end of the first racing lap, Rosberg led Hamilton by 1.3 seconds; followed by Bottas, Massa, Ricciardo, Magnussen, Vettel, Räikkönen, Pérez and Kvyat.\u000aBottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen and Räikkönen made pit stops to change to intermediate tyres on lap 12. After his early pit stop, Button moved up to eighth place on the same lap. Massa and Vettel made their pit stops on lap 13, Vettel moving in front of Massa and rejoining ahead of teammate Ricciardo. Rosberg made his pit stop on lap 14 and rejoined in second position, 22 seconds behind Hamilton (who recorded fast sector times in an attempt to move ahead of Rosberg after the latter's pit stop). Hamilton went off onto the run-off area at the Spoon Curve, reducing the gap by one second. Rosberg reclaimed first position when Hamilton approached the exit of the pit lane after the latter's stop. He reported that his car was oversteering, and Button held a 6.5-second advantage over both Williams cars. The Red Bull cars reduced the gap to Massa in sixth by lap 16, with Vettel moving to the inside line and passing Massa with a narrow margin at the hairpin on this lap; Ricciardo then attempted a similar manoeuvre on the outside at the Spoon Curve, but Massa accelerated clear heading into 130R corner.\u000aMagnussen made a second pit stop at the end of lap 16 to change his steering wheel. On lap 17 Ricciardo went to the outside of Massa on the S-curves and moved inside, passing Massa to move into sixth. Rosberg was informed by team radio that more rain was expected within eight minutes. Vettel overtook Bottas around the outside for fourth place on lap 18; Bottas then fell to fifth on lap 19 when Ricciardo passed him around the outside at the S-curves. Vettel began to reduce the gap to third-place Button, with Ricciardo driving at a speed similar to his teammate. Bottas was caught by his Williams teammate Massa, who pulled away from Hülkenberg (who went off the track at the second turn). Both Red Bull drivers were the fastest by lap 21, but Vettel was still 13 seconds behind Button and a further five seconds behind Rosberg, who now led Hamilton by only one second having run off the track at 130R. A dry line began to emerge by this time as some drivers drove through standing water to keep their tyre temperatures down.\u000a\u000aDRS was enabled on lap 24. Although Hamilton had closed Rosberg's lead to half a second and used the system, he could not pass his teammate. Räikkönen made a pit stop this lap, which went wrong as his mechanics struggled to install a right-front wheel nut correctly. Hamilton tried to pass Rosberg again the following lap by running in his slipstream, but Rosberg held the line and had enough acceleration to defend first place. Hamilton held a tighter line, while Rosberg complained of more oversteer on lap 26. On lap 27, Hamilton forgot to deactivate his DRS system and lost control of his rear; his brakes locked, and he went into the turn one run-off area. However, he caught up to Rosberg and ran closely behind his teammate into the hairpin without trying to pass. Hamilton moved across the track during the lap in an attempt to pass; Rosberg's car shuddered, and Hamilton got a better run onto the pit-lane straight. He was in Rosberg's slipstream before passing him on the outside heading into the first turn to take the lead on lap 29. Hamilton pushed hard and pulled away from Rosberg, who lost control heading into the pit-lane straight.\u000aGutiérrez lost ninth position on lap 30 when he was passed by Kvyat, who drove through standing water on the inside of the pit lane straight and used DRS. Vettel made his second pit stop for intermediate tyres on the same lap, rejoining in fifth behind Ricciardo but ahead of both Williams cars. Button, still third, recorded faster lap times than Rosberg, closing the gap to 12.8 seconds by the beginning of lap 31. Pérez overtook Gutiérrez to take over tenth position on the same lap. Button made a second pit stop for new intermediate tyres at the end of lap 31; his pit crew also changed his steering wheel, lengthening the stop and putting him behind both Red Bull drivers. Vettel recorded a new fastest lap of the race at one minute and 51.915 seconds, 2.3 seconds quicker than Hamilton. Rosberg made his second pit stop, for new intermediate tyres, on lap 33 and came out behind Ricciardo. Magnussen experienced understeer and spun 360 degrees after running onto the run-off area. Hamilton made a pit stop at the end of lap 35 for new intermediate tyres, giving Ricciardo the lead. Heavy rain began to fall on lap 36; Ricciardo made his pit stop during this lap and rejoined fifth, behind Hamilton, Rosberg, Vettel and Button.\u000aOn lap 38, Magnussen ran wide onto the first-turn run-off area, while Vergne went off the track at the second corner and Vettel drove into the gravel trap at the S-turns; all three drivers continued running. Ricciardo closed up to Button on the same lap and attempted to pass him around the inside at the hairpin; Button defended his position, and Ricciardo ran wide. Hamilton recorded the overall fastest lap of the race on lap 39, at one minute and 51.600 seconds. Weather conditions continued to deteriorate, resulting in DRS being disabled on lap 41; visibility was reduced due to fading light and low cloud cover, while drivers were being dazzled by the lights on their steering wheels. Ricciardo attempted to overtake Button again that lap by taking the inside lane into the hairpin, but Button took a wide line. The Australian driver finally got past at the hairpin on lap 42, with Button then making a pit stop for full wet tyres. On the same lap, Sutil lost control of his Sauber due to aquaplaning, spinning into the outside tyre barrier at the top of the hill at Dunlop Curve. Double yellow flags were waved at the corner to warn drivers about the incident, and Whiting did not use the safety car. Sutil's car was extracted from the track by a tractor crane that lap and turned backwards toward a gap in the barrier. Then, on lap 43, Bianchi lost control of his Marussia at 213 km/h (132 mph), veering right towards the run-off area outside the Dunlop Curve. Although he applied his throttle and brake pedals simultaneously, his fail-safe system did not work because the settings of his brake-by-wire system were incompatible.\u000a\u000aBianchi collided with the rear of the tractor crane, which caused extensive damage to his car; its roll bar was destroyed as it slid underneath. The impact jolted the tractor crane off the ground, causing Sutil's car (suspended in the air by the crane) to fall to the ground. Marshals moved away from the scene to avoid being struck by Bianchi's Marussia. Calculations in July 2015 indicated a peak of 254 g0 (2,490 m/s2), and data from the FIA's World Accident Database, which sources information from racing accidents worldwide, indicate that Bianchi's impact occurred 2.61 seconds after loss of control, at a speed of 123 km/h (76 mph) and an angle of 55 degrees. Bianchi was reported unconscious after not responding to a team radio call or marshals. Marshals reported the accident, and safety and medical cars were dispatched. Bianchi was extracted from his car and treated at the crash site before being taken by ambulance to the circuit's medical centre. Transport by helicopter was impossible due to the weather, so Bianchi was taken by ambulance with a police escort to Mie Prefectural General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, about 15 km (9.3 mi, a 32-minute drive) from the track.\u000aA second red flag was waved on lap 46, bringing the race to an early end; the results were taken from the running order at the end of lap 44. Hamilton thus won from teammate Rosberg by 9.1 seconds, with Vettel twenty seconds further back in third. Ricciardo finished just under ten seconds behind his Red Bull teammate, and nearly half a minute ahead of Button. Massa, Bottas, Hülkenberg, Vergne and Pérez rounded out the points-scoring positions. Kvyat, Räikkönen and Gutiérrez filled the next three positions, each one lap behind Hamilton, with Magnussen, Grosjean, Maldonado, Ericcson, Chilton and Kobayashi the last of the classified finishers who were not involved in any incident. Bianchi and Sutil were classified in 20th and 21st, despite their accidents. Hamilton and Rosberg both led on two occasions, with Rosberg leading 26 of the 44 laps and Hamilton the other 18. Hamilton's victory was his eighth of the season, his first at Suzuka, and the 30th of his Formula One career.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== After the race ===\u000aOut of respect for the seriously-injured Bianchi, the top three finishers did not spray champagne. At the podium interviews, conducted by the 1992 World Champion Nigel Mansell, Hamilton said that it had been a difficult race weekend and his speed near the end of the race was reminiscent of the 2008 British Grand Prix. Rosberg called it a good weekend for his team, and congratulated Hamilton on the victory. Vettel said that he was lucky that the safety car came out, and was happy with his performance. At a later press conference, Hamilton said that he was confident in his car's balance when he passed Rosberg on lap 28, and saw no difference in the amount of standing water on the track when more heavy rain fell. Although Rosberg's car was set up similar to Hamilton's, he was unhappy with its balance and tried to adjust it during his pit stop. According to Vettel, the weather was borderline and his team decided to make a pit stop when it deteriorated.\u000aBianchi's crash overshadowed the race. His father, Philippe, initially reported to L'Équipe that Bianchi was in critical condition with a head injury and was undergoing an operation to reduce severe cranial bleeding. The FIA then said that CT scans indicated that Bianchi sustained a "severe head injury" in the crash, and would be admitted to the intensive care unit after surgery. His family later reported that he had a diffuse axonal injury, a traumatic brain injury common in vehicle accidents involving quick deceleration. The first family update after Bianchi's emergency surgery was made by his father during the week of 13 October; the driver was reportedly in a "desperate" condition, with doctors saying that his survival would be a miracle. His father said that he drew hope from the emergence of seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher from his coma. Marussia also issued regular updates on Bianchi's condition, denying initial speculation about their role in the accident. Former FIA president Max Mosley described it as a "freak accident".\u000a\u000aControversy arose after an amateur video clip of Bianchi's crash, showing a marshal waving a green flag at the crash site, was uploaded to social media. Four-time world champion Alain Prost said that the marshal should have moved away from the crash scene, but five-time 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Emanuele Pirro said that it was normal practice and anyone who said otherwise was "mistaken". According to several commentators, the marshal committed no infraction. Former driver and Sky Sports F1 announcer Martin Brundle called for recovery vehicles to be barred from driving on the track. Driver steward Mika Salo defended Whiting's decision not to deploy the safety car after Sutil's crash, and minimised claims that the race was stopped for intensifying rain. Rede Globo lead commentator Galvão Bueno, however, was vocal in his criticism of Whiting's decision, describing it as "the biggest mistake I've seen in 40 years in Formula One".\u000aThe FIA announced a ten-person review panel, composed of former drivers and team principals, to investigate the cause of the accident and published its findings four weeks later in Doha. According to the report, there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident; contributing factors included track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the track. The report made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering disabled vehicles (which were introduced for 2015), and concluded that it would have been impossible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries with changes to cockpit design. Since 2015, for safety reasons, the FIA has required that the start time of certain Grands Prix be at least four hours before sunset or dusk (except for designated night races). FIA safety commission chairman Peter Wright was quoted in July 2015 as saying that a closed cockpit would not have prevented Bianchi's head injuries, and vice-president Andy Mellow confirmed that attaching impact protection to recovery vehicles was unfeasible.\u000aHospitalised in Yokkaichi, Bianchi remained in a critical but stable condition on a medical ventilator. He was removed from his induced coma in November and began breathing unaided, enabling him to be transferred to the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice (CHU) in Nice. Bianchi remained unconscious in critical condition there, but his family were better able to visit. On 13 July 2015, Bianchi's father said that he was "less optimistic" about his son's chances because of the lack of significant progress and the length of time since the accident. Bianchi died four days later, aged 25, thus becoming the first Formula One driver to be killed by injuries sustained during a Grand Prix since Ayrton Senna in 1994. Bianchi's funeral, on 21 July at Nice Cathedral, was attended by members of the Formula One community.\u000aThe race result increased Hamilton's lead over Rosberg in the World Drivers' Championship to ten points. Ricciardo and Vettel maintained third and fourth place, and Alonso remained in fifth despite his retirement. Mercedes moved further ahead of Red Bull in the Constructors' Championship, with a 180-point lead over the Austrian team. Williams increased their advantage over Ferrari in the battle for third, and Force India retained fifth place with four races left in the season.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Classification ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Qualifying ===\u000aNotes:\u000a^1 \u2014 Pastor Maldonado and Jean-Éric Vergne both received a ten-place grid penalty for exceeding their quota of five engine components for the season.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Race ===\u000aNotes:\u000a^1 \u2014 Pastor Maldonado had 20 seconds added to his race time for pit-lane speeding.\u000a^2 \u2014 Jules Bianchi died on 17 July 2015 from injuries sustained during the accident.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Championship standings after the race ==\u000a\u000aNote: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes and references ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Notes ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== References ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a Media related to 2014 Japanese Grand Prix at Wikimedia Commons

aVWillard Richards MD (June 24, 1804 \u2013 March 11, 1854)  Prominant Physcian and midwife/nurse trainer to tens of thousands, was an extraordinary early leader in the Latter Day Saint movement and served as Second Counselor in the First Presidency to church president Brigham Young in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1847 until his death.\u000aWillard Richards was born in Hopkinton, Massachusetts,(Boston Marathon starting point) to Joseph Richards and Rhoda Howe on June 24, 1804. At the age of four, he injured his head in a fall and was left with some residual muscle tremor and paralysis. As the injury limited his physical activity, he focused his attention on education and obtained a teacher's certificate at age sixteen. He taught school in Chatham, New York, and in Lanesborough, Massachusetts. Richards pursued additional studies in physical mechanics, science, and studied the clarinet. At the age of thirty, after the death of his sister Susan, Richards decided to become a medical doctor. He studied at the Thomson Infirmary in Boston focusing on medication and herbal preparations . Dr. Ricards, student at Thompson Infirmary was imersed in emergency and trauma surgery - Thompson was hospital for hundreds of casualties - Boston Abolition Riots of 1835  He then settled in Holliston, Massachusetts, where he practiced medicine.Dr. Richards stayed true to the famed Thompsonian System of Botanical treatments  ,precursor to revolutionary pharmecuticals.  initially Eli Lilly's Quinine \u000aIn 1836, Dr. Richards was introduced to the newly published Book of Mormon by his cousins, Joseph and Brigham Young. Dr. Richards read the book twice within ten days and, after making the necessary preparations, left for Kirtland, Ohio, to join the Church of the Latter Day Saints. Dr. Richards was baptized there on December 31, 1836, by Brigham Young and ordained an elder in February 1837.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Church service ==\u000aShortly following his ordination, Dr. Richards was called on a brief three-month mission to the Eastern United States. Immediately upon his return, he was called on a more extended mission to Great Britain. Richards met his wife, Jennetta Richards, while on this mission. They had two surviving children, a son, Heber John, born in Manchester, England, in 1840, and a daughter, Rhoda Ann Jennetta, born in 1843 in Nauvoo, Illinois.\u000aDr. Richards was ordained an apostle on April 14, 1840, by Brigham Young. In 1841, he moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, to be with the body of the church. Dr. Richards organized the medical services in Nuvoo, training midwive trainers, and provided sanitation advice in particular the malaria and cholera issues. . Also he became the private secretary to Joseph Smith. In December 1842, Richards was called to be the Church Historian and Recorder, a position he held until his death. In these two capacities, Richards maintained the Mormon prophet's schedule and recorded most of his activities. As church historian, he subsequently wrote a total of 1,884 pages on the history of Joseph Smith. This work was later incorporated into The History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, edited by B. H. Roberts.\u000aDr. Richards was incarcerated in Carthage Jail with Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith and John Taylor on June 27, 1844, when the jail was attacked by a mob and the Smiths were murdered. Taylor was shot four times and severely injured, but survived the attack. Dr. Richards was unhurt and so supervised the removal of Taylor and the Smiths' bodies. Over a year prior to the attack, Joseph Smith had told Dr. Richards that "the time would come that the balls would fly around him like hail, and he should see his friends fall on the right and on the left, but that there should not be a hole in his garment." His first-hand account of the event was published in the Times and Seasons.\u000aDr. Richards, his cousin Brigham Young and other church elders left Nauvoo in February 1846, spending the remainder of the year at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. This first group entered into the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847. They then went back to Winter Quarters, arriving on August 21, 1847, to gather the families for the Mormon Exodus of 1848, and deal with the malaria and cholera. Richards was called as Second Counselor in the First Presidency under Brigham Young on December 27, 1847 in Council Bluffs, Iowa. After moving to Utah, Richards trained and established the extensive 500 midwife network spread throught the Deseret Territory settelments, working with Eliza Snow, Relief Society President, training Young Women.  and was involved in establishing the Deseret News, serving as its first Editor-in-Chief.\u000aDr. Richards worked tirelessly with Eliza Snow to identify a replacement doctors among the trained young women, largely accomplished by organized delegation even to 15 year old girls focus on satitation. Snow found a young woman Ellis Reynolds Shipp, who went to medical school then pediatrics speciality under the world renowned pediatrics pioneer Victor Vaugh in Michigan 1881 Truly LDS, (quasi military)delegation, the combined effort of Richards, Shipp and Snow in training and deploying an army of midwives drastically reduced infant mortality and loss of women in childbirth, especially in remote colonies.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Death ==\u000aRichards died in Salt Lake City on March 11, 1854, and was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aRichards\u2013Young family\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aQuinn, D.

aVSanford Lockwood Cluett (June 6, 1874 \u2013 May 17, 1968) was an American businessman and inventor known for developing Sanforization (1928), a process to pre-shrink woven fabrics, and Clupak paper used in stretchable shopping bags and wrapping paper. However, Cluett had 200 patents about many other techniques. Cluett had been vice president and a director of the corporation Cluett, Peabody and Company, Inc. of Troy, New York. During 1904\u20131917, Cluett had served in the New York National Guard, reaching the rank of major.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life and work ==\u000aSanford Lockwood Cluett was born on June 6, 1874, in Troy, NY, as son of Edmund Cluett and Mary Alice Stone Cluett. He attended the local Troy Academy, graduating in 1894. Cluett received a civil engineering degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 1898.\u000aIn 1897, Cluett had joined the New York National Guard, in the rank of private. He was active with the New York Volunteer Infantry during the Spanish\u2013American War. By July 1898, he was transferred to the First U.S. Volunteer Engineers, along with serving in the Puerto Rican campaign, and was later promoted to captain eventually. During 1904\u20131917, he served in the New York National Guard, where he achieved the rank of major prior to retirement.\u000aCluett was known for several inventions, including a sextant and farm mowers, before patents for Sanforizing. In 1896, he invented the bubble sextant for use in celestial navigation. In 1901 he was hired by the Walter A. Wood Company in Hoosick Falls, New York, for the manufacturing of mowers, reapers and other farm machinery. In developing some horse-drawn mowers operable from the driver's seat, his two-horse and one-horse mowers had a vertical lift at the cutting bar.\u000aIn 1919, after 22 years in other work or military service, Sanford Cluett joined the company Cluett, Peabody & Co., which had been founded by his uncles as a textile firm which made men's clothing, including Arrow collars, Arrow shirts and other items. He became Research Director, and in 1927 became Vice President of the firm.\u000aIn 1928, he developed the process of Sanforizing (patented in 1930), to pre-shrink cotton or other fabrics by squeezing material against a stretched rubber strip or band and allowing the pair to shrink together, to offset the stretching of fabrics during prior weaving or finishing.\u000aSanford Cluett also held over 200 patents, for various techniques, including Clupak extensible paper as a stretchable paper (Investment Reader, April 15, 1959) used for shopping bags and wrapping paper with magazines, meat, tires, and furniture.\u000aAfter a period of failing health, Sanford Cluett died on May 17, 1968, at his winter home in Palm Beach, Florida, at age 93.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000abubble sextant\u000aball recording sextant\u000aEli Whitney, inventor of the cotton gin\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVKelling Heath Holiday Park is a holiday park in Norfolk, England, owned and operated by Blue Sky Leisure. Kelling Heath Holiday Park is located on the North Norfolk coastline between the market towns of Sheringham and Holt. The holiday park got its name from the surrounding area, Kelling Heath, which is recognised as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe Kelling Heath Holiday Park site was purchased by the Timewell family following a period of prolonged negotiations.\u000aOriginally opened on 6 April 1984, the park\u2019s opening had been rushed to ensure that it could benefit from the popular Easter holiday period, which turned out to be the hottest Easter for years. Over the next few years significant refurbishments were carried out on the site\u2019s facilities, including extensive work on its electrical system, as well as its shower, WC and laundry blocks.\u000aJust after the 1991 May Day weekend the entire park had to be evacuated when two drums containing toxic chemicals washed up on the nearby Weybourne beach.\u000aIn 1999 Kelling Heath began its red squirrel breeding programme, which was part of a national initiative to re-introduce these animals into the British eco-system. The program has proven to be a success and the animal can be found throughout the Kelling Heath park. In 2013 the park announced that for the first time it has two breeding pairs of red squirrels, which resulted in two baby red squirrels being born in the park and that were named Sunny and Summer.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Accommodation and Facilities ==\u000aThere are a number of accommodation options at the park, from camping pitches to luxury holiday homes. Onsite facilities include restaurants, a bike hire, swimming pool and shower/WC blocks.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Environmental Impact ==\u000aKelling Heath has become noted for its positive impact on the local environment. The holiday park has introduced a number of environmentally-friendly practices, most notably its successful red squirrel breeding programme. The company has also invested £180,000 in harnessing the power of solar energy.\u000aThe holiday park is located within a Site of Special Scientific Interest and as a result it has become known for its commitment to managing its rare habitat. Many of the park\u2019s accommodations are set amongst its woodland environment and the structure of its permanent buildings are sympathetic to its environment.\u000aIn 2014 the park\u2019s environmental credentials were further heightened when it became the location for the popular BBC2 programme, Stargazing Live. This programme highlighted the park\u2019s prime position for astronomy enthusiasts and the fact that it is located away from major cities means that it provides the darkness needed for stargazing.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Train Station ==\u000aKelling Heath is one of the only holiday parks in the UK to have its own train station, Kelling Heath Halt railway station. The station is part of the North Norfolk Railway, which is a 10.5 mile round trip and connects Sheringham with Holt.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Recognition ==\u000aKelling Heath Holiday Park won the 2013 Caravan Holiday Park/Holiday Village of the Year at the Visit England Awards of Excellence.\u000aThe park was subsequently featured and reviewed in The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mirror.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aKelling Heath Holiday Park

aVThe Mercedes-Benz OC 500 LE is a modular, heavy-duty, twin-axle bus chassis produced by Mercedes-Benz/EvoBus Ibérica, Spain. It was designed as a modular platform for low-entry city, suburban, and intercity buses with a maximum gross vehicle weight of 19.1 tonnes. The main modules consist of: 1) driver's pedestal, 2) front axle, 3) buggy centre section, 4) drive axle and 5) engine. It has much in common with the chassis used for the Mercedes-Benz Citaro integral bus range, and also the raised floor OC 500 RF coach chassis. The engine is horizontally mounted over the rear overhang.\u000aMercedes-Benz in Brazil manufacture a low-entry chassis known as the O 500 U, which is related to the OC 500 LE, but is not identical. It is also available as the articulated O 500 UA and the quad-axle articulated O 500 UDA, with the latter giving a vehicle length of 23 metres. The O 500 U is also available in Australia, marketed as OH1830LE.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Technical details ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Variations ===\u000aOC 500 LE 1825h\u000aEngine type: OM 457 hLA (Euro III) inline 6-cylinder 11.967-litre turbocharged intercooled, direct injection diesel\u000aPower: 185 kW (252 hp) @ 2000 rpm\u000aTorque: 1100 N m (811 ft·lbf) @ 1100 rpm\u000aOC 500 LE 1825hG\u000aEngine type: M 447 hLAG (Euro IV/Euro V/EEV) inline 6-cylinder 11.967-litre turbocharged intercooled, lean burn, spark ignition single point injection CNG\u000aPower: 185 kW (252 hp) @ 2000 rpm\u000aTorque: 1050 N m (774 ft·lbf) @ 1000-1400 rpm\u000aOC 500 LE 1830h\u000aEngine type: OM 457 hLA (Euro III/Euro IV/Euro V/EEV) inline 6-cylinder 11.967-litre turbocharged intercooled, direct injection diesel\u000aPower: 220 kW (299 hp) @ 2000 rpm\u000aTorque: 1250 N m (921 ft·lbf) @ 1100 rpm\u000aOC 500 LE Euro VI\u000aEngine type: OM 936 (Euro VI) inline 6-cylinder 7.698-litre turbocharged intercooled, direct injection diesel\u000aPower: 220 kW (299 hp) @ 1200 rpm\u000aTorque: 1200 N m @ 1200-1600 rpm\u000aInitially available with Euro III engines, the OC 500 LE chassis got upgraded to Euro IV, Euro V and EEV-compliant diesel engines using AdBlue Selective Catalytic Reduction technology. With Euro IV, Euro V and EEV, the 252 hp rating of the OM 457 hLA was discontinued, making the 299 hp engine as standard for the OC 500 LE. It is also available with the OM 936 engine in Euro VI markets.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Transmissions ===\u000aCurrently, Mercedes-Benz only offers a ZF EcoLife 6-speed automatic transmission with integrated hydraulic retarder (model 6 AP 1200 B for the 252 hp CNG engine or model 6 AP 1400 B for the 299 hp diesel engine).

There have been 15 OC 500 LE CNG fires in Perth, and in October 2013, the Public Transport Authority commenced legal action against Mercedes-Benz, Evobus and Volgren. The action was dropped in 2014.\u000aSydney Buses purchased 255 CNG and 20 diesel powered examples, all with Custom Coaches bodies, however one was destroyed by fire in June 2011. Other purchasers included Ventura Bus Lines (72), Brisbane Transport (40), Premier Illawarra (38), Kefford Corporation (19) and Darwin Bus Service (14).\u000aMany operators across Australia have now purchased the OC 500 LE in various configurations. Problems related to quality control and unreliable electronics have not been uncommon. A lot of these complaints have come from drivers due to some units being under-powered, uncomfortable or rough.\u000aBrisbane Transport withdrew its O 500 LEs from the fleet for a short period because of a major unidentified fault which caused buses to suddenly accelerate without warning. This problem was fixed by Mercedes-Benz and these vehicles are now back on the road. However, as they were under lease from Mercedes-Benz, their lease expired in 2013 and were then sold to Transit Systems Sydney where they currently operate.\u000aIn January 2009, Mercedes-Benz Australia issued a recall on 443 CNG-fuelled OC 500 LE units due to respecified welding specifications for the turbocharger oil supply pipe.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Singapore ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== SMRT Buses ====\u000a\u000aSMRT Buses had taken delivery of 134 Mercedes-Benz OC 500 LEs for fleet replacement and expansion. These buses feature bodywork built by Gemilang Coachworks of Malaysia and assembled by Thonburi Busbody Limited of Thailand, with a CapaCity licensed front from Mercedes-Benz, engines that meet Euro V emissions standards and are SMRT's first wheelchair accessible buses (WABs). They were the first to feature voice announcement system, with announcements similar to the ones used on the MRT. They are also the first buses in South-East Asia to be fitted with a Euro V engine. The last bus to be registered, SMB134H, was registered on 1 October 2009.\u000aDemonstrator\u000aThe first OC 500 LE took part in the launch of SMRT's Go Green event on 30 April 2008. The bus was later registered as SMB1H and initially entered revenue service on Service 190 on 29 June 2008. It was later redeployed to operate on Service 172, only half a year into service. It is currently used as a Kranji Bus Depot (KJDEP) training bus with a new design of EZ-Link card readers installed.\u000aFirst production batch\u000aThe batch were registered in the ranges of SMB2E to SMB67T. The first few units of this batch were put to service from 22 September 2008 onwards.\u000aSecond production batch\u000aThe second production batch featured many more differences as compared to its first batch counterparts, most notably its interior. Blue as well as purple colour schemes were used on the seats in contrast to the first batch's corporate colour seats. Stickers greeting onboard passengers can be found at the front and the rear of the bus. A blue tint situated on the top of the windscreen below the Electronic Destination System reduces glare from the sun, and more grab poles and aircon outlets were added at the last few rows of seats.\u000aThey were registered from SMB68R till SMB134H. The first few units commenced passenger service on 1 July 2009, almost a year to the day the first unit of the OC 500 LE (SMB1H) made its first trip.

aVThe Monument of Matrones (1582) was the first published anthology of English women's writing. A compilation of prayers and meditations written largely by and for women published in London, its full title was The Monument of Matrones: Conteining Seven Severall Lamps of Virginitie, or Distinct Treatises; Whereof the First Five Concerne Praier and Meditation: the Other Two Last, Precepts and Examples. The Monument's seven "Lampes" or books make up 1500 quarto pages.\u000aThe Monument was compiled by Thomas Bentley, then a student of Gray's Inn, in a bid for royal patronage, and issued by the printer Henry Denham in 1582, just as the cult of Elizabeth I as the Virgin Queen was emerging. The desired patronage was not forthcoming, and Bentley became churchwarden of St Andrews Holborn with the support of John Aylmer, Bishop of London, in 1584.\u000aDescribed in its Introduction as "diuers verie godlie, learned and diuine treatises, of meditationes and praier, made by sundrie right famous Queenes, noble Ladies, vertuous Virgins, and godlie Gentlewomen of al ages", Bentley's compilation provides virtuous examples and precepts for women, as well as prayers and devotional works. The second "Lampe" or treatise collects important works of Protestant female piety, including Marguerite of Navarre's Miroir de l'âme pécheresse, a mystical narrative of the soul as a yearning woman translated by Queen Elizabeth as the Mirror of the Sinful Soul, along with prayers and devotional works by Anne Askew; Frances Neville, Lady Bergavenny; Queen Catherine Parr; Lady Jane Grey; and Queen Elizabeth herself, to whom the work was dedicated.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

At the same time, he designated Oleg as his successor in Halych, requesting that Vladimir and the Galicians promise not to take the city from Oleg. After his death, however, Oleg was deposed and had to seek help from Ryurik Rostislavich in Vruchiy. After Oleg failed to solicit aid from Ryurik Rostislavich, he went to Duke Casimir II of Poland (1177\u20131194).\u000aOleg's stepbrother, Vladimir Yaroslavych lived a dissolute life and took to himself a priest's wife. When the Galician boyars threatened to kill his wife, Vladimir Yaroslavich took her and his two sons and fled to King Béla III of Hungary (1172\u20131196). A later chronicle, however, describes the event differently, stating that Oleg and Duke Casimir II defeated Vladimir Yaroslavich and forced him to flee to the Hungarians, after which Casimir II appointed Oleg to Halych.\u000aOleg was poisoned by the townspeople of Halych who invited Roman Mstislavich of Vladimir-in-Volhynia to be their prince.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Ancestry ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Footnotes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sources ==\u000aDimnik, Martin: The Dynasty of Chernigov \u2013 1146\u20131246; Cambridge University Press, 2003, Cambridge; ISBN 978-0-521-03981-9.

aVEcoinformatics, or ecological informatics, is the science of information (Informatics) in Ecology and Environmental science. It integrates environmental and information sciences to define entities and natural processes with language common to both humans and computers. However, this is a rapidly developing area in ecology and there are alternative perspectives on what constitutes ecoinformatics.\u000aA few definitions have been circulating, mostly centered on the creation of tools to access and analyze natural system data. However, the scope and aims of ecoinformatics are certainly broader than the development of metadata standards to be used in documenting datasets. Ecoinformatics aims to facilitate environmental research and management by developing ways to access, integrate databases of environmental information, and develop new algorithms enabling different environmental datasets to be combined to test ecological hypotheses.\u000aEcoinformatics characterize the semantics of natural system knowledge. For this reason, much of today's ecoinformatics research relates to the branch of computer science known as Knowledge representation, and active ecoinformatics projects are developing links to activities such as the Semantic Web.\u000aCurrent initiatives to effectively manage, share, and reuse ecological data are indicative of the increasing importance of fields like Ecoinformatics to develop the foundations for effectively managing ecological information. Examples of these initiatives are National Science Foundation Datanet projects, DataONE and Data Conservancy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aecoinformatics.org, Online Resource for Managing Ecological Data and Information\u000aEcoinformatics Collaboratory, Research links and public wiki for discussion.\u000aEcoinformatics Education, Ecosystem Informatics at Oregon State University\u000aindustrial Environmental Informatics, Industrial Environmental Informatics at HTW-Berlin, University of Applied Sciences\u000aInternational Society for Ecological Informatics\u000aCanadian Facility for Ecoinformatics Research, Ecoinformatics at the University of Ottawa, Canada\u000aEcoinformatics program at the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis\u000aEcological Informatics: An International Journal on Ecoinformatics and Computational Ecology\u000aEcological Data\u000aNSF DataNet call for proposals\u000aDataONE\u000aData Conservancy\u000a[1], EcoInformatics Summer Institute, an NSF-funded REU site (Research Experience for Undergraduates)

aVPeruRail is a railway operator working tourist, freight, and charter services in southern Peru. It was founded in 1999 by Peruvian entrepreneur Lorenzo Sousa Debarbieri and British company Sea Containers.\u000aThe main line between the port of Matarani, Arequipa (the capital of this region is Peru's second largest city), Cusco and Puno on Lake Titicaca was formerly known as the Ferrocarril del Sur (Peru Southern Railway), and was for a time owned and operated by the ENAFER state company. It is the third highest railway in the world after the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Railway to Tibet and the FCCA line from Lima to Huancayo.\u000aFrom Cusco, PeruRail provides passenger services on the 3 ft (914 mm) gauge Ferrocarril Santa Ana to Aguas Calientes, delivering tourists for Machu Picchu.\u000aIt operates in a 50/50 joint venture between Belmond and Peruvian Trains and Railways, owned by Lorenzo Sousa Debarbieri and son Renzo Sousa. Lorenzo Sousa Debarbieri is the chairman of the board of directors of the company.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Routes ==\u000aPeruRail's routes are divided into two sections; there are no tracks through Cusco.\u000aThe line between Cusco and Machu Picchu - Ferrocarril Santa Ana - is a 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge line, which boasts a series of five switchbacks called locally 'El Zig-Zag', which enable the train to climb up the steep incline out of Cusco, before it can begin its descent to the Sacred Valley of the Incas and then continue down to Machu Picchu. However, this section of the route is currently suspended, and all trains to Machu Picchu leave from Poroy, just outside Cusco, instead.\u000aFrom Poroy, the narrow-gauge line goes northwest to Ollantaytambo, where the branch from Urubamba joins, then on to Machu Picchu station in Aguas Calientes. Tracks formerly continued into the jungle, but they were destroyed by recent flooding.\u000a\u000aThe 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in (1,435 mm) standard gauge network, formerly Ferrocarril del Sur, starts at Matarani port, goes through Arequipa and enters Puno Region, where the line splits in two at Juliaca. The eastern branch goes to Puno; the western branch runs into Cusco.\u000aAt its highest point, La Raya Pass (14°28\u203259\u2033S 70°59\u203220\u2033W), the altitude is 4,313 m (14,150 ft). The train makes a stop in La Raya pass where there is an exquisite view over all the plains to the snowcapped mountains, and a beautiful old chapel, standing all alone in the middle of the Andean plateau.\u000aThere's no more passenger traffic between Arequipa and Matarani, and it was also suspended on the Juliaca - Arequipa line for several years until May 2017 when the Belmond Andean Explorer was inaugurated.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Passenger transport ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Tourist trains ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Cusco - Aguas Calientes (Machu Picchu) ====\u000aOn the route from Cusco to Machu Picchu, PeruRail transports the vast majority of visitors and provides several different services.\u000aThe Belmond Hiram Bingham Pullman, named after Machu Picchu's American discoverer, Hiram Bingham, is the most expensive service. It departs from Poroy at 9 a.m., later than other departures. Meals, guides, bus service and entrance to the ruins are included.\u000a\u000aOther services include the Vistadome, provided by refurbished 1965-vintage German Ferrostaal railcars, with at-seat refreshments and large side and overhead windows allowing views of the mountainous terrain, and Expedition trains, which offer basic service in upholstered seats at a lower price. Snacks are sold and space is provided for backpacks, particularly for Inca Trail hikers.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Cusco - Puno (Lake Titicaca) - Arequipa ====\u000a\u000aThe luxury sleeper train, Belmond Andean Explorer is operated from Cusco for a one-night journey to Puno, and a two-night three-day journey to Arequipa. Its carriages were formerly used on the Great South Pacific Express in Australia between 1999 and 2003, and brought to Peru in February 2016.\u000aUntil the inauguration of this service in May 2017, the name was featured by a first-class service day train, which was renamed to Titicaca Train. It has Pullman-style dining cars and an open-air observation bar car similar to Hiram Bingham. This service provides a 10-hour trip from Cusco to Puno. The interiors of its vehicles were designed by James Park & Associates, the same company who designed the elegant first-class cabins for Singapore Airlines. The actual work, however, was done in Cusco by Cusquenian workers. After the refurbishment was completed, a traditional Andean ceremony, 'Pago a la Tierra' (payment to Mother Earth), was organised to 'bless' the train. A local shaman presided over the ceremony, which involved many traditional rites.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Local trains ===\u000aAlthough not advertised, PeruRail also offers local trains equipped with wooden seats and that are available only to Peruvian nationals for a fraction of the price charged to tourists.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Freight ==\u000aPeruRail runs daily freight services between the port of Matarani, the city of Arequipa, and the Andean cities of Juliaca, Puno, and Cuzco. Under PeruRail's administration the tonnage transported increased from 460,000 tons during 1999, 573,000 tons in 2000 to 639,000 tons during 2001.\u000aThe main products transported by PeruRail are copper concentrates, fuel, wheat (for Peruvian and Bolivian consumption), coal, cement, soya flour from Bolivia, coffee, beer and non-alcoholic beverages.\u000aPeru Rail transports copper concentrates for the most important mines in Peru, Las Bambas, Cerro Verde and other important mining clients.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Shipping ==\u000aThe car float Manco Capac operates across Lake Titicaca between PeruRail's railhead at Puno and the port of Guaqui in Bolivia. PeruRail also owns the former ferry SS Ollanta, which was launched on Lake Titicaca in 1931. Ollanta is now refurbished for tourist cruises and PeruRail has leased her out for charter work.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aList of stock used by PeruRail\u000aIperú\u000aLa Raya mountain range\u000aRail transport in Peru\u000aTransport in Peru\u000aTourism in Peru\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aWhetham, Robert D.

aVJean-Sifrein Maury (26 June 1746 \u2013 10 May 1817) was a French cardinal, archbishop, and bishop of Montefiascone.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aThe son of a very poor cobbler, he was born on at Valréas in the Comtat-Venaissin, the enclave within France that belonged to the pope. His acuteness was observed by the priests of the seminary at Avignon, where he was educated and took orders. He tried his fortune by writing éloges of famous persons, then a favorite practice; in 1771, his Éloge on Fénelon was pronounced by the French Academy as second only to that by La Harpe.\u000aThe real foundation of his fortunes was the success of a panegyric on Saint Louis delivered before the Académie française in 1772, which caused him to be recommended for an abbacy in commendam. In 1777 he published under the title of Discours choisis his panegyrics on Saint Louis, Saint Augustine and Fénelon, his remarks on Bossuet and his Essai sur l'éloquence de la chaire, a volume which contains much good criticism, and remained a French classic through the nineteenth century, as long as elegant rhetoric was valued in the pulpit. The book was often reprinted as Principes de l'éloquence. He became a favorite preacher in Paris, and was Lent preacher at court in 1781, when King Louis XVI said of his sermon: "If the abbé had said only a few words on religion, he would have discussed every possible subject."\u000aIn 1781, he obtained the rich priory of Lyons, near Pronne; and in 1785 he was elected to the Académie française as Lefranc de Pompignan's successor. His morals were as loose as those of his great rival Mirabeau, but he was famed in Paris for his wit and gaiety. He was elected a member of the Estates-General of 1789 by the clergy of the bailliage of Péronne, proving from the first to be the most able and persevering defender of the ancien régime. (He had, nonetheless, drawn up the greater part of the cahier of the clergy of Péronne which contained a considerable programme of reform.) It is said that he attempted to emigrate both in July and in October 1789, but after that time, deserted by nearly all his friends, he decided to remain in France.\u000aIn the National Constituent Assembly he took an active part in every important debate, combating with especial vigour the alienation of the property of the clergy. His life was often in danger, but his ready wit always saved it and it was said that one bon mot would preserve him for a month. When he did emigrate in 1792, he found himself regarded as a martyr to the church and the king, and was at once named archbishop in partibus; extra nuncio to the diet at Frankfort; and, in 1794, cardinal. He was finally made bishop of Montefiascone in Italy, where he settled down briefly, but in 1798 the French drove him from his retreat, and he sought refuge in Venice and St. Petersburg.\u000aNext year he returned to Rome as ambassador of the exiled Louis XVIII at the papal court. In 1804, he began to prepare his return to France by a well-turned letter to Napoleon, congratulating him on restoring religion to France once more. In 1806 he did return and in 1807 was again received into the Academy; and in 1810, on the refusal of Cardinal Fesch, was made Archbishop of Paris. He was presently ordered by the pope to surrender his functions as archbishop, but refused. On the Bourbon restoration toward the end of 1814, he was summarily expelled from the Academy and his archiepiscopal palace.\u000aMaury retired to Rome, where he was imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo for six months for his disobedience to the papal orders. He died in 1817, a year or two after his release, primarily from disease contracted in prison.\u000aAs a politician, his wit and eloquence made him a worthy rival of Mirabeau. He sacrificed much to personal ambition, yet remained publicly unremembered by Louis XVIII as a courageous supporter of Louis XVI and by the papacy as the one defender of the Church during the States-General.\u000a\u000a\u000a== The critic ==\u000aAs a critic, he was and is considered a very able writer. Sainte-Beuve gives him the credit of discovering Father Jacques Bridayne and of giving Bossuet his rightful place as a preacher above Massillon.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

aVVilla Romana is a German residence for artists situated in Florence.\u000aThe winners of the Villa Romana Prize and international guest artists spend time living and working in the Villa. A vast programme of exhibitions and events make Villa Romana a dynamic centre for contemporary art production and international cultural exchange.\u000a\u000a\u000a== The Villa ==\u000aVilla Romana is a neoclassical building dating to around 1850. It is named after the road it stands on which was known at the time as via Romana (now via Senese).\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The Foundation ===\u000aVilla Romana is the oldest German artists\u2019 residence abroad. It was founded in 1905 by Max Klinger, a symbolist painter, sculptor and printmaker who was at the time vice-chairman of the Deutscher Künstlerbund (German Artists\u2019 Association).\u000aKlinger had nurtured the dream of establishing a house for German artists in Italy since at least 1889, when he stayed in Florence with his friend and colleague Karl Stauffer-Bern. He wanted to create a residence and permanent landmark in the city where the artistic revival of the 15th century took place. When the Deutscher Künstlerbund was set up in Weimar in 1903, Klinger tabled his proposal, arguing that \u201ctalented artists ought to have the chance to work tranquilly for a while in a pleasant environment; it is not about setting up either a school for dilettantes or a shelter for the penniless.\u201d The proposal was approved two years later on 12 January 1905, and it was decided to send Klinger to Florence with the Leipzig publisher Georg Hirzel to look for suitable premises.\u000a\u000aOn 24 March, Hirzel, Klinger and his companion Elsa Asenijeff and other friends left for Florence. Within a few weeks they had purchased a neoclassical villa to the south of the city, not far from Porta Romana. On 4 April Klinger sent a telegraph to the collector and art patron Harry Graf Kessler in London: \u201ctoday become owner of Villa Romana Florence.\u201d The Deutscher Künstlerbund had been founded by progressive artists as a bulwark against imperial academicism. True to the same spirit, Villa Romana has never been a state institute but is recognised as an independent initiative by a group of artists.\u000aAlthough the initial idea had been to rent the villa, it was actually bought outright, which later proved to be a far-sighted decision. Shortly afterwards, on 16 December 1906, the Villa Romana e.V. association was set up as sponsoring body, with Max Klinger as its first chairman. Independence from the Deutscher Künstlerbund led to conspicuous donations from the very start. Moreover, the revival of activities after the interruptions and confiscations that took place during the two World Wars would have been impossible if Villa Romana had not belonged to the association.\u000aIn the middle of June 1905, the Deutscher Künstlerbund announced the first winners of the Villa Romana Prize, most of whom were representatives of the Vienna, Munich and Berlin secessions: Gustav Klimt, Thomas Theodor Heine, Fritz Erler, Georg Kolbe, Henry van de Velde, Ulrich Hübner and Kurt Tuch. Of these, only Kurt Tuch, Georg Kolbe and Ulrich Hübner were able to accept, and they arrived in the autumn of 1905 as the first fellows of Villa Romana. The following year\u2019s fellows included the young Max Beckmann \u2013 whose famous self-portrait wearing a black suit and holding a cigarette, with the Florentine landscape in the background (now in the Kunsthalle in Hamburg) dates to his stay in the villa \u2013 and the first female artists, Dora Hitz and Käthe Kollwitz.\u000aIn addition to their artistic activity in the studios, the fellows also helped with the renovation, furnishing and administration of the Villa. They lived under the guidance of the first full-time director of the Villa, the theologian and former SPD politician, Theodor Wächter.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, economic support arrived from Germany from the first sponsors and patrons of the institute: Eduard Arnhold (who also funded Villa Böcklin in Fiesole and Villa Massimo in Rome), Adolf vom Rath and Erich Schulz-Schomburgk from the Deutsche Bank. From Leipzig, Max Klinger continued to occupy himself with the developments of his favourite project up until his death in 1920.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== During the wars ===\u000aWhen the First World War broke out the fellows were recalled to Germany for military service. The director Theodor Wächter ceded the Villa to the Italian Red Cross and it was transformed into a military hospital. After the War the Italian State confiscated the Villa as enemy property, and it was not until 1925, after repeated efforts (including a petition to Mussolini), that it was returned to the Villa Romana e.V association.\u000aAfter an interruption of more than ten years in the artistic activity, in 1928 the Saxon sculptor Gerhard Sacks arrived at the Villa as a fellow, followed a year later by the Cologne painter Joseph Fassbender, who became one of the leading exponents of the Rhineland artistic scene in the post-war period.\u000aDuring the Nazi era, the Villa Romana e.V. association had to submit to the regime: the board of directors was forced to make room for representatives of the Reich\u2019s Ministry for Education and Propaganda. All members who were Jews or whose ideas were not aligned with those of the party were expelled from the association. Despite the restrictive Nazi influence on the administration of Villa Romana, it succeeded in appointing the artist Hans Purrmann as its new director in 1935. With the support of the then chief consultant of the Deutsche Bank Hans-Alfons Simon, who was able to mitigate Nazi oppression, the Florentine residence became an inviolate \u2013 albeit frequently threatened \u2013 \u201csemi-emigration centre\u201d for German artists. Purrmann himself discovered in 1937 that one of his works had been displayed at the Degenerate Art (Entartete Kunst) exhibition in Munich in 1937. Other German artists discredited by the Third Reich also found refuge in Florence, including Emy Roeder, who won the Villa Romana Prize in 1936. Nevertheless, during the years of dictatorship the choice of the fellows had to adhere to the stylistic trends of the regime. Openly avant-garde artists were rejected in favour of more moderate exponents of modern art such as Toni Stadler, a follower of Nazi ideology who produced archaic-style sculptures.\u000aAfter the armistice of Cassibile in 1943, the colony of German artists had to leave Florence, and in 1945 Villa Romana was again confiscated by the Italian State. In 1948 the former director Hans Purrmann  and the President of the Federal Republic of Germany Theodor Heuss engaged in negotiations for the return of the Villa, which was approved in the summer of 1953 by a committee of international allies. In the interim, in 1949, the Villa Romana e.V. association had also been resuscitated.  In 1958 the sculptor Kurt Hermann Rosenberg was appointed as director, followed by the teacher and puppeteer Harro Michael Siegel in 1964.\u000aThe artists resident in Villa Romana between the 1960s and 70s helped to give new stimulus to the institute. They included Johannes Gecelli, Peter Brüning and Horst Antes, Georg Baselitz in 1965, and five years later Markus Lüpertz and Ben Willikens.\u000aJoachim Burmeister came to Florence at Willikens\u2019 invitation and went on to become director of Villa Romana, continuing in office for 34 years.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== From the 1970s to 2006 ===\u000aJoachim Burmeister took over as director on 1 March 1972 and continued to manage the artistic life of Villa Romana up to 2006. The institute had to address major challenges in the early 1970s since its status and significance as an illustrious residence for promising German artists had been seriously undermined.\u000aTo open up Villa Romana to the artistic debates and approaches of the time, Burmeister undertook a policy of renewal based on the notion of getting rid of all irrelevant pathos about the Bel Paese and taking a long hard look at Italy. He wanted to avoid the Villa stagnating as a museum of itself, instead of making its name as a node of the international network, albeit outside the major centres of artistic production.\u000aTo do so, Burmeister introduced studios for guest artists and sought to open the institute to the public. He opened up the historic \u201cSalone\u201d of the Villa as an exhibition space, entrusting it to the care of his first wife, Katalyn Burmeister. Between 1979 and 2004 around five shows a year were organised, mostly of German and Italian artists.\u000aAlso starting from the 1970s, the selection of the prizewinners was more consciously oriented towards international artistic developments. Evidence of this is the participation of many former fellows at documenta 6, curated by Manfred Schneckenburger in 1977: Dorothee von Windheim, Heinz-Günter Prager and Alf Schuler, Nikolaus Lang, Michael Buthe and Anna Oppermann.\u000aAfter Burmeister\u2019s successful renewal in the 1970s, the position of Villa Romana on the international artistic scene began to decline again in the years that followed. It became stylised as a \u201cutopia of modernity\u201d. At the end of Burmeister\u2019s mandate in 2006 a new change of direction was called for, and the challenge was addressed by the incoming director Angelika Stepken. The first move, between 2006 and 2007, was a complete renovation of the villa carried out with funds from the German federal government.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== From 2006 to today ===\u000aUp to 2006 the curator and art critic Angelika Stepken was director of the Badischer Kunstverein in Karlsruhe. From the start of her mandate at Villa Romana she devoted herself to restyling its image, seeking to conceive the institute on the basis of \u201ccontents rather than atmosphere\u201d. She consistently intensified collaboration with the artists, as well as stepping up communication and cooperation at both local and international level. She streamlined the process for judging the Villa Romana Prize, defined a programme of exhibitions and public events and introduced new formats for the production of interdisciplinary knowledge to attract multifaceted historical and critical research. She expanded the narrow Italian-German perspective to an all-round sphere of action, inviting numerous guest artists mostly from the Mediterranean region. A second and larger exhibition space was opened on the ground floor of the Villa, and the large, nearly 4-acre garden was redesigned as a space for reflection and action through a lengthy process of liaison with the landscape architects of atelier le balto. Since 2011 a temporary pavilion of 80 square metres is also available for use in the garden. The first project was designed by the young architectural practice Avatar; this was replaced in autumn 2017 with a new pavilion by the Florentine architect Claudio Nardi.\u000aSince 2011 the independent contemporary art radio station Radio Papesse also has its premises in Villa Romana, accompanying the institute\u2019s programme of events with interviews, live-streaming and talks with artists.\u000aUnder Stepken\u2019s direction many young German winners of the Villa Romana Prize have successfully made their names on the international artistic scene in recent years. For instance, Clemens von Wedemeyer went on to participate at documenta 13, Henrik Olesen won the Wolfgang Hahn Prize, Vincent Vulsma took part at the 6th Berlin Biennale in 2010, while Petrit Halilaj and Yorgos Sapountzis participated at the 57th Venice Biennale in 2017. The number of female artists among the prizewinners has also increased considerably.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The garden ===\u000aVilla Romana is surrounded by a garden of almost 4 acres consisting of various different areas: a sloping lawn, an olive grove, an orchard and a historic Tuscan-style garden with bay hedges and cypress trees. The garden was largely planted in its current form between the 1970s and 1990s, growing over the decades into a thick forest. So, in 2008, Stepken invited artists, landscape architects and art historians to develop new concepts for the meaning and future of the garden. The upshot was that for many years the redefinition of the entire area was entrusted to the Franco-German landscape architects Atelier le balto. The bay hedge was lowered, the magnolia tree was pruned and the bamboo thicket was thinned out. A \u201croom\u201d with a view over the garden was created behind the Salone, and a bamboo platform was erected in the wild laurel tree. The olives were pruned and the ground was ploughed. A path edged with irises running along the outer wall was retrieved, as was a terrace with a view over Florence. Since then Atelier le balto is regularly invited to the Villa to monitor the state of the garden and to conceive further new spaces, sightlines and relations between the areas inside and outside the garden.\u000aTheoretical insight to support the practical gardening activity was provided during the Semaines de Jardin, held in September 2009 and 2010. Master students, botanists, philosophers, architects, cooks and artists were involved in seminars, exercises, public discussions and evening art events to foster the ongoing conceptual evolution of the garden.  \u000a\u000a\u000a== The Villa Romana Prize ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Prize ===\u000aThe Villa Romana Prize \u2013 the oldest German prize for artists \u2013 has been awarded every year since the Florence residence was founded in 1905. It is normally conferred on four outstanding, generally young, artists resident in Germany, who are given the opportunity to develop their artistic research over a 10-month stay in Florence between 1 February and 30 November.  \u000aDuring their stay the four winners have at their disposal a studio and a furnished flat inside the villa. The fellows also receive a bursary, currently amounting to 1,500\u20ac per month.\u000aEvery year eminent artists and curators are called to serve on the jury. In 2018 the curator Bonaventure Soh Bejeng Ndikung, Curator at Large of documenta 14 and founder of the SAVVY Contemporary project in Berlin, and the multi-prize winning Berlin-based artist Nasan Tur were on the jury.\u000aDuring their time at Villa Romana the fellows can also propose artists, researchers or other partners for brief sojourns at the Villa.\u000aAt the beginning of their residency all prizewinners exhibit their work in the display areas of the Villa; at the end of their stay they prepare a publication together in the form of an artist\u2019s book, which is then generally presented publicly in Berlin.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Prizewinners ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== 1905 to 1914 ====\u000a1905: Ulrich Hübner, Georg Kolbe, Richard Pietzsch, Kurt Tuch, Max Kurzweil\u000a1906: Max Beckmann, Dora Hitz, Käthe Kollwitz, Hermann Schlittgen\u000a1907: Martin Brandenburg, Georg Burmester, Fritz Mackensen\u000a1908: Ernst Barlach, Richard Dreher, Wilhelm Groß, Henry Tscharmann\u000a1909: Paul Baum (artist) Paul Baum, Willi Geiger, Adolf Schinnerer\u000a1910: Karl Albiker, Otto Höger, Hans Meid\u000a1911: Ludwig Cauer, Otto Höger, Fritz Rhein\u000a1912: Theo Brockhusen, Alexander Gerbig, Georg Greve-Lindau\u000a1913: Karl Caspar, Moritz Melzer, Erich Stephani\u000a1914: Otto Richard Bossert, Bernhard Hasler, Wilhelm Laage\u000a\u000a\u000a==== 1928 to 1943 ====\u000a1928: Gerhard Marcks\u000a1929: Joseph Fassbender\u000a1930: Josef Henselmann\u000a1931: Xaver Fuhr\u000a1932: Hans Christof Drexel\u000a1933: John Sass\u000a1934: Otto Freytag\u000a1935: Philipp Harth, William Maly\u000a1936: Emy Roeder, Arthur Degner\u000a1937: Toni Stadler\u000a1938: Helmut Ruhmer\u000a1939: Fritz Bernuth\u000a1940: Rudolf Riester\u000a1941: Hans Breker, Karl Clobes, Walter Rossler\u000a1942: Oscar Kreibich, Hubert Nikolaus Lang, Karl Paul, Egon Schiffers\u000a1943: Wilhelm Hausmann, Kurt Lambert, Walter Wichmann\u000a\u000a\u000a==== 1959 to 1969 ====\u000a1959: Theo Bechteler, Peter Herkenrath, Carl-Heinz Kliemann, Toni Stadler\u000a1960: John Geccelli, Jochen Hiltmann, Guido Jendritzko, Harry Koegler\u000a1961: Peter Brüning, Erwin Eichbaum, Wilhelm Hausmann, Wolfgang vom Schemm\u000a1962: Horst Antes, Gerson Fehrenbach, Paran G'schrey, Hans Kock\u000a1963: Friedrich Karl Gotsch, Günter Ferdinand Ris, Ursula Sax, Horst Skodlerrak\u000a1964: Clemens Fischer, Winfred Gaul, Utz Kampmann, Rolf Szymanski\u000a1965: Georg Baselitz, Franz Bucher, Rainer Küchenmeister, Ludwig Meidner\u000a1966: Hans Baschang, Dietlinde Stengelin, Helmut Sundhaußen, Gota Tellesch\u000a1967: Bernd Berner, Buja Bingemer, Horst Lark, Michael Black\u000a1968: Franz Bernhard, Rolf-Gunter Dienst, Hildegart Lutze, Gatja Helgart Rothe\u000a1969: Henry Brummack, Bernd Damke, Wolf Kahlen, Joachim Schmettau\u000a\u000a\u000a==== 1970 to 1979 ====\u000a1970: Markus Lüpertz, Ansgar Nierhoff, Michael Schoenholtz, Ben Willikens\u000a1971: Peter Ackermann, Hermann Albert, Christa Dichgans, Jürgen Paatz\u000a1972: Klaus Fußmann, Edgar Gutbub, Max G.

In parallel with the annual sojourns of the fellows, the Villa hosts a vast programme of exhibitions and public events.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Exhibitions ===\u000aAt the beginning of their residence, the winners of the Villa Romana Prize are invited to collectively display a selection of their works. Exhibitions of the work of local and international artists are also organised in the historic ground-floor premises of the Villa. The criteria governing the display activity revolve around both contemporary artistic production and reflection on more or less recent episodes of art history seen from a Florentine perspective. Examples among the 2017 shows are the exhibition on Giuseppe Chiari with works from the Block collection, and the show addressing the artistic event Umanesimo, Disumanesimo 1890/1980 held in Florence in 1980, featuring material from the paper archives of the curator Lara-Vinca Masini.\u000aMany exhibitions are also held outside the Villa, for instance at the Italian Embassy in Berlin in 2015, or at the Kunsthalle of the German Federal Republic in Bonn in 2014.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Open Studios ===\u000aAt the start of her activity in Villa Romana, Angelika Stepken introduced into the programme of the residence a public event that over the years has become one of the most popular and well-attended. These are the Open Studios, held every year on the first Saturday in September, when the Villa Romana fellows open their studios to the public, displaying their work and their current research. The open days are rounded off by installations, videos, performances and concerts by international artists and musicians in the rooms of the Villa and in the garden.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Mediterranean Dialogues ===\u000aSince 2007 Villa Romana has paid special attention to fostering dialogue within the Mediterranean area. Guest artists from countries such as Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Kosovo and Albania are invited to stay for a short while at the Villa to take part in shows, symposia and events. This has led over the years to the creation of a dynamic network of friendships, collaborative projects and exchange with both the Villa Romana fellows and the Italian public.\u000aThe aim of the Mediterranean Dialogues is to expand the southwards gaze of the German institute beyond the Italian borders, looking towards the Mediterranean countries as significant stakeholders for exchange and dialogue about the current practices and conditions of artistic production. In this way, and within the Florentine context, Villa Romana probes decolonialist perspectives, addressing the historic narratives of European modernity through new formats of knowledge production.\u000aSome of the artists taking part in the Mediterranean Dialogues in 2017 were Bassel Al Saadi (Damascus), Faton Mazreku (Malishevë, Kosovo) and the team of Fehras Publishing Practices (Damascus/Berlin)\u000a\u000a\u000a=== music@villa ===\u000aSince 2010 contemporary music production has also come to play an important part in the Villa Romana programme. Once or twice a year the Italian musicians Francesco Dillon and Emanuele Torquati organise a series of concerts under the umbrella of music@villa. These events always give rise to new co-operative ventures at international level, on the verge between contemporary avant-garde and electronic music.  \u000a\u000a\u000a=== Other events ===\u000aVilla Romana\u2019s vast programme also comprises workshops and performances, talks with artists and debates, conferences and symposia, concerts and film shows, in liaison with local and international guests. In this way the artists\u2019 residence addresses recent debates relating to art and current affairs, pursuing its mission as a centre for the production of contemporary art and for cultural exchange.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Patrons and sponsors ==\u000aThe Villa Romana e.V association was founded in 1906 by the Deutscher Künstlerbund, since when it has been the sponsoring body of the residence and has established the Villa Romana Prize.\u000aThe association is funded largely by donations from private patrons including businesses, foundations and private citizens. The main sponsors which have been supporting the Villa for many years are the Deutsche Bank Stiftung foundation and the German Federal Government Commission for Culture and Media. The activities of Villa Romana are currently also co-funded by: Daimler AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Dr. Egon and Hildegard Diener-Stiftung, Dr. Arend Oetker and Dr. Brigitte Oetker.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Publications ==\u000aGadenz Ilaria/Stepken Angelika (eds.), Maria Gloria Bicocchi, Giancarlo Cardini, Alvin Curran, Gian Piero Frassinelli, Daniele Lombardi, Paolo Masi, Lara Vinca Masini, Gianni Pettena, Renato Ranaldi parlano di/sprechen über Giuseppe Chiari, VfmK Verlag für moderne Kunst GmbH, Vienna 2017\u000aVilla Romana e.V.

aVThe National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) is a branch of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The institute aims to improve the oral, dental, and craniofacial health through research and the distribution of important health information to the American people.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aIn 1931, the United States Public Health Service established a Dental Hygiene Unit at the National Institutes of Health. Designated as the first dental research worker, Dr. H. Trendley Dean studied the communities affected by the oral disease known as mottled enamel. Following the implementation of a water fluoridation trial in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR), was established by President Harry S. Truman on June 24, 1948. The first grants and fellowships that supported dental research were awarded the following year.\u000aIn an effort to expand the NIDR, plans to finance the construction of a building for the institute were approved by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1958. The National Institute of Dental Research also established the Laboratory of Biochemistry to further the research regarding the structure and functions of various proteins. In continuing with this expansion, a grant to develop several dental research facilities at various universities was approved in 1967. This program hoped to establish research and training environments, as well as promote interdisciplinary approaches to combating oral diseases.\u000aIn addition to the Laboratory of Biochemistry, other laboratories were established in the years 1974 and 1975. These newly established laboratories focused on the field of oral medicine as well as the fields of microbiology and immunology. Another effort to expand research was implemented a decade later. The Dentist Scientist Award Program aimed to provide dentists with opportunities and incentive to pursue independent research regarding oral health.\u000aIn 1986, the most extensive survey on the dental health of American adults was completed by the NIDR. This study was the first to examine oral health diseases on a large and detailed scale. Following this survey, in 1993, the National Oral Health Information Clearinghouse was established. The purpose of this database is to provide resources for health professionals, patients, and the general public regarding oral health. In continuing with its mission to distribute important health information, the NIDR launched its official website in 1996.\u000aFollowing its 50th anniversary, the NIDR changed its name to the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR).\u000aIn 2001, the NIDCR released its revamped plan to eliminate oral health disparities across the United States. The institute followed up with this plan by establishing five new Centers for Research to Reduce Oral Health Disparities.\u000aA decade later, Martha J. Somerman was appointed as the eighth and current director of the NIDCR. Through nurturing fundamental research and the development of researchers, the NIDCR aims to promote health, to prevent diseases and conditions, and to develop new diagnostics and therapeutics.\u000a\u000a\u000a== NIDCR Directors ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes and references ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aNational Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research\u000aDental, Oral, and Craniofacial Data Resource Center\u000aNIDCR Official Twitter

aVShigeru Uehara (\u4e0a\u539f \u7e41, Uehara Shigeru, born September 5, 1947 in Tokyo) is a Japanese automotive engineer. He was the project leader of the Honda NSX.\u000aShigeru Uehara began his career at Honda R&D Co., Ltd in 1971, and went on to become the company's specialist in vehicle stability and handling performance. In 1985 he was appointed Large Project Leader for the mid-ship research project that led to the NSX project in 1990. Amongst his many contributions to the company, Uehara led Honda\u2019s sports car development projects of three very important projects at Honda R&D, and saw them from conception to ending culminating in the S2000, Honda Integra Type-R (DC2/DC5) and the NSX-R. He is also known for his close friendship with the late Ayrton Senna.\u000aShigeru Uehara completed the S2000 CR as his last project before retirement, as his pride and joy. The color (Apex Blue) is his favorite color, the tires are made with the same tread design as the NSX-R's Potenza's (which he helped design), and the purpose built body kit produces lots of rear end down-force at speed. Also, the shocks and springs are stiffer than the standard S2000. Uehara called the S2000 CR his final gift before retirement.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000ahttp://world.honda.com/NSX/concept/\u000ahttp://world.honda.com/news/2007/4070919S2000/printerfriendly/index.html\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==

aVThe Capitol Theatre is a former cinema and concert venue on Union Street in Aberdeen, Scotland.\u000aThe Capitol opened in February 1933, on the site of the earlier Electric Cinema. It seated 2,100, to the plans of architects AGR Mackenzie and Clement George. In 1933, the Capitol was Aberdeen's most luxurious cinema, with full stage facilities, a holophane lighting system and a Compton Organ.\u000aIn addition to functioning as a cinema, The Capitol featured regular stage shows and these gradually became the venue\u2019s focus. The venue showed its final film in 1995 and closed in 1998, with the exception of a bar at the front of the building.\u000aIn the early 2000s, The Capitol was converted into a nightclub. At this stage, the rear section of the building was largely remodelled and many of the remaining features removed. The nightclub closed in 2009.\u000aThe Capitol is a category B listed building. In September 2013, planning permission was granted for Knight Property Group to renovate the front third of the building and replace the derelict auditorium with a modern ten storey building. The building is now open as office space over 9 levels and 72,600 sq.f\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aAberdeen theatres and concert halls\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a"431 Union Street, former Capitol Cinema: Listed Building Report".

aVOuvrage Simserhof is a gros ouvrage of the Maginot Line, located near the community of Sierstal in the French département of Moselle. Simserhof is adjoined by petit ouvrage Rohrbach and gros ouvrage Schiesseck, and faces the German frontier. Located 4 km to the west of Bitche, the ouvrage derived its name from a nearby farm. It was a part of the Fortified Sector of Rohrbach. During the Battle of France in 1940, Simserhof supported its neighboring fortifications with covering artillery fire, with partial success. After the surrender of France, it was occupied by the Germans as a storage depot for torpedoes, and later resisted the American advances of late 1944. Taken by the Americans, it was briefly re-occupied by the Germans during Operation Nordwind. Following the war it was repaired for use by the French Army, but was proposed as a museum of the Maginot Line as early as the 1960s. Retained by the Ministry of Defense, Simserhof now functions as a museum, and has the most extensive visitor infrastructure of any of the preserved Maginot fortifications.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Design and construction ==\u000aInitial project planning was led by Colonel Frossard. The first concept consisted of five closely spaced blocks fronted by an anti-tank ditch. The entry for the ouvrage was to be built in a ravine to the rear, with a 60 cm rail line running to a supply network farther behind the lines. The plan was rejected in July 1929 by CORF (Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiées), the central planning agency for the Maginot Line. A number of objections were raised, including the amount of clear-cutting required, and an insufficient field of fire with dead ground exploitable by an attacker.\u000aThe second concept envisioned two ouvrages 300 metres (980 ft) apart, arranged for mutual support. This plan was adopted in September 1929 at the direction of Maréchal Pétain, despite increasing costs estimated at 38 million francs. Further modifications raised the projected cost to 62 million francs. Ultimately, eight combat blocks were constructed, with a single mixed entry, the principal work spanning from 1930 to 1933. The entire project ran from 1929 to 1938. By 1934 the central utility plant (usine) was in place, along with ammunition lifts and the internal railway. In 1938 the anti-tank obstacles were complete. Final costs were 118 million francs (equivalent to \u20ac30 million). Plans to provide blockhouses covering an anti-tank ditch were dropped.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description ==\u000a\u000aSimserhof was, like most Maginot fortifications, composed of a combat section and a support section. Two separate entries were provided for personnel and ammunition, with underground utilities, mess halls and barracks nearby the personnel entrance. A large "M1" magazine was provided near the munitions entrance. The combat blocks were as much as 1800 meters from the entry. The entire ouvrage was provided with a 60 cm gauge electric railway that connected the service areas with the combat blocks, and which extended outside the position to a network of similar surface railways behind the main Line. The gallery system was excavated at an average depth of 27 metres (89 ft) below the surface.\u000aBlock 1: Artillery block with one retractable twin machine gun turret, one automatic rifle cloche (GFM), one twin machine gun embrasure, one 135mm gun embrasure and one machine gun (JM)/47mm anti-tank gun embrasure (JM/AC47).\u000aBlock 2: Infantry block with one observation cloche (VDP), one GFM cloche, one 81mm mortar cloche, one twin machine gun embrasure and one JM/AC47 embrasure.\u000aBlock 3: Infantry block with two GFM cloches, one 81mm mortar turret, one twin machine gun embrasure and one JM/AC47 embrasure.\u000aBlock 4: Artillery block with one GFM cloche, one retractable twin machine gun turrets, one twin machine gun embrasure, one JM/AC 37 embrasure and one 135mm gun embrasure.\u000aBlock 5: Artillery block with three 75 mm gun embrasures, one GFM cloche, one VDP cloche and one grenade launcher cloche (LG).\u000aBlock 6: Artillery block with three 75mm gun embrasures, one VDP cloche, one LG cloche and one GFM cloche.\u000aBlock 7: Artillery block with one 135 mm gun turret and two GFM cloches.\u000aBlock 8: Artillery block with two GFM cloches and one retractable twin 75mm gun turret.\u000aPersonnel entry: Entry block with two GFM cloches, one LG cloche and one JM/AQC47 embrasure.\u000aMunitions entry: Entry block with two GFM cloches and one JM/AC47 embrasure.\u000aBlocks 1, 2, and 5 comprised the west wing, and 3, 4 and 6 the east. Blocks 7 and 8, with their turrets, we located between the two wings and to the rear, along with the command post.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Casemates and shelters ===\u000aA series of detached casemates and infantry shelters are in the vicinity of Simserhof, including\u000aCasemate du Sinnerberg Ouest: Single block with one JM/AC47 embrasure, one twin machine gun embrasure and a GFM cloche.\u000aCasemate du Sinnerberg Est: SIngle block with one JM/AC47 embrasure, one twin machine gun embrasure and a GFM cloche.\u000aCasemate de Petit-Réderching Ouest: Single block with one JM/AC47 embrasure, one twin machine gun embrasure and a GFM cloche.\u000aCasemate de Petit-Réderching Est: Single block with one JM/AC47 embrasure, one twin machine gun embrasure and a GFM cloche.\u000aAbri de Réderching: Subsurface abri-caverne with three arms ports and three GFM cloches\u000aCasemate du Seelberg Ouest: Single block with one JM/AC47 embrasure, one twin machine gun embrasure and a GFM cloche, functioning as an observation post.\u000aCasemate du Seelberg Est: Single block with one JM/AC47 embrasure, one twin machine gun embrasure and a GFM cloche.\u000aCasemate de Judenhoff: Double block with two JM/AC47 embrasures, two twin machine gun embrasures and two GFM cloches.\u000aAbri de Fröhmühle: Subsurface abri-caverne with two automatic rifle embrasures.\u000aCasemate de Hohlbach: Single block with one JM/AC47 embrasure, one twin machine gun embrasure, a mortar cloche and two GFM cloches.\u000aCasemate de Légeret: Single block with one JM/AC47 embrasure, one twin machine gun embrasure, a mortar cloche and two GFM cloches.\u000aAbri de Légeret: Subsurface abri-caverne with two GFM cloches.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Manning ==\u000aSimserhof was garrisoned by 28 officers and 792 men of the 153rd Fortress Infantry Regiment and the 155th Position Artillery Regiment, as well as elements of the 1st, 15th and 18th Régiments du Génie. The garrison was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Bonlarron from 25 April 1940. The ouvrage was under the overall command of the French 5th Army.\u000aIn times of peace, the active troops were stationed in newly built regular barracks in Légeret. When the ouvrage was on combat alert, daily life was similar to that of a warship.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aSee Fortified Sector of Rohrbach for a broader discussion of the Rohrbach sector of the Maginot Line.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1940 ===\u000aSimserhof was first garrisoned in March 1936 while still incomplete. It was reinforced with fortress troops after the Munich Agreement in September 1938 and further augmented in March 1939. On 21 August 1939 the Maginot Line was brought to a state of readiness for war. General mobilization was ordered on 2 September, and a state of war was declared the following day. Simserhof fired for the first time on 12 October, when a 75mm gun turret supported troops twelve kilometers in front of the fortified line. On 10 May 1940, Germany launched the Blitzkrieg against the West, but in front of the Maginot Line, the front remained calm. On 12 May, Simserhof responded to the bombardment of advanced French posts.\u000aOn 13 June the troops of the field army in the intervals between fortifications began to withdraw towards the south. According to the plan, Simserhof would cover the withdrawal and the garrison troops would withdraw in turn after sabotaging the equipment. Simserhof provided covering fire from 15 June, but by the 16th it was apparent that the retreat was nearly impossible. Lt. Colonel Bonlarron stopped the sabotage and prepared for a siege. From 21 June the ouvrage's artillery fired to prevent German troops from advancing on its neighbor, Welschof. Simserhof was too distant to support Ouvrage Haut-Poirier, and the position surrendered on the 22nd. The same day the Second Armistice at Compiègne was signed, which provided for a cease-fire from the 25th.\u000aOne the 24th the situation at Welschoff had declined, and the ouvrage surrendered. The same day, Simserhof protected Rohrbach against German attack, firing approximately 13,500 shells in defense of its neighbor. The fate of the garrisons under the armistice terms remained ambiguous. The Germans tried to negotiate with the ouvrages but were rebuffed each time, as the commanders of the ouvrages awaited orders from their superiors. On 30 June, at a meeting at Grand-Hohekirkel, Lt. Colonel Simon brought the ouvrage commanders the order to relinquish their fortifications to the victors.\u000aOn June 30 Simserhof formally surrendered and the Germans rendered honors to the garrison. Maintenance was continued by French technicians, and the ouvrage was used by the Germans as a storage facility for torpedoes.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 1944 ===\u000aAt the end of November 1944 the U.S. Seventh Army under General Alexander Patch pursued the Germans. Simserhof was occupied by elements of the German 25th Panzer Grenadier Division. From 15 November the U.S. 44th Infantry Division assaulted Simserhof, using tank destroyers to fire at firing apertures in block 5. Combat engineers were assigned to attack individual blocks. The Germans abandoned Simserhof by an emergency exit after booby-trapping the installations during the night of 19\u201320 November. The 44th Infantry yielded to the U.S. 100th Infantry Division, which occupied the ouvrage during the first days of 1945, but the German counter-offensive Operation Nordwind caused the occupiers to leave the fort. It was re-occupied on 15 March without resistance from the Germans. Bitche was finally liberated on 16 March.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Cold War ===\u000aFollowing World War II, interest revived in the use of the Maginot Line to defend against a possible Soviet advance through southern Germany. Funds were allocated for restoration of the gros ouvrages, but work was limited to restoration of systems and improvements to existing armament, with work completed by 1953. In 1951, Simserhof had been designated part of the Mòle de Bitche, a strong point in the northeastern defenses against Soviet attack. By the late 1950s interest in fixed fortifications was waning after France developed a nuclear deterrent. The money needed to maintain and upgrade the fortifications was diverted for the nuclear programs. Simserhof was proposed as a potential museum in the 1960s.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Preservation ==\u000aSimserhof remains the property of the French Ministry of Defense. Its museum operations are managed by the Moselle département and the city of Bitche. Restoration work is ongoing. Simserhof has an extensive array of visitor services, including a gift shop, picnic area and café. The tour is limited to the entry, caserne and magazine, excluding the combat blocks.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of all works on Maginot Line\u000aSiegfried Line\u000aAtlantic Wall\u000aCzechoslovak border fortifications\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sources ==\u000aThis article incorporates text translated from the corresponding French Wikipedia article as of January 25, 2008.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000aAllcorn, William.

aVThe Vienna U-Bahn (German: U-Bahn Wien), where U-Bahn is an abbreviation of the German term Untergrundbahn (English: underground railway), is one of the two rapid transit (metro) systems for Vienna, Austria. The second system is the Vienna S-Bahn. With the opening in October 2013 of the 4.2 kilometers (2.6 mi)-, three-station extension of the U2 line, the five line U-Bahn network consists of 78.5 kilometers (48.8 mi) of route, serving 104 stations. It is the backbone of one of the best performing public transport systems worldwide according to UITP (International Association of Public Transport) in June 2009. More than 1.3 million passengers rode the Vienna U-Bahn every day in 2009, and 567.6 million passengers used the U-Bahn in 2011, which declined to 428.8 million passengers in 2013. The network is undergoing expansion and rolling stock renewal. Since 1969, 200 million euros have been invested annually in the extension of the Vienna U-Bahn.\u000aThe modern U-Bahn opened on 25 February 1978 (after test operations began on 8 May 1976), but two of the lines extended and later designated as U-Bahn (U4, U6) date back to the Stadtbahn ("city railway") system, which opened in 1898. Parts of the U2 and U6 lines began as subway tunnels built to accommodate earlier tram lines. Only the U1 and U3 were built wholly as new subway lines.\u000aLines are designated by a number and the prefix "U" (for U-Bahn) and identified on station signage and related literature by a colour. There are five lines; U1, U2, U3, U4 and U6. Since the late 1960s there have been numerous suggestions of routings for a line U5, but all these projects had been shelved until the construction of a new U5 was announced in early 2014. Stations are often named after streets, public spaces or districts, and in some special cases after prominent buildings at or near the station, although the policy of the Wiener Linien states that they prefer not to name stations after buildings.\u000aTicketing for the network is integrated under the Wiener Linien umbrella brand with all means of public transport in Vienna, including trams and buses. Local tickets are valid on S-Bahn suburban rail services and other train services but those are operated by the state railway operator, ÖBB. Tickets are not valid on bus services operated by Vienna Airport Lines and the City Airport Train express train.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aCompared to other underground railways worldwide, the Vienna U-Bahn is young. The question of whether to build a Vienna U-Bahn was the subject of heated debate for over one hundred years. From 1844 to the 1960s, numerous mass train transport plans were discussed, ignored or simply rejected.\u000a\u000aThe first system to be constructed was a four-line Stadtbahn railway network (which had been planned to have three main and three local lines) using steam trains. Ground was broken in 1892, and the system was opened in stages between 11 May 1898 and 6 August 1901. At Hütteldorf, the Stadtbahn connected to railway service to the west, and at Heiligenstadt, to railway service on the Franz Josef Line, which then ran eastwards within the Austro-Hungarian Empire to Eger. Some of the Jugendstil stations for this system designed by Otto Wagner are still in use. However, the Stadtbahn proved inadequate for mass transport, less successful than the tramway. Starting in 1910, plans were considered for an underground system, but were interrupted by the First World War, which also necessitated closing the Stadtbahn to civilian use. After the war, the economic situation of a smaller and poorer country ruled out continuing with the plan. However, starting on 26 May 1924 the Stadtbahn was electrified, something that many had called for before the war, and from autumn 1925 it was integrated with the tramway rather than the railways. The frequency of trains tripled. Plans for a U-Bahn dating to 1912\u201314 were revived and discussions took place in 1929, but the Great Depression again necessitated abandoning planning.\u000aBoth in 1937 and after the Anschluß, when Vienna became the largest city by surface area in the Third Reich, ambitious plans for a U-Bahn, and a new central railway station, were discussed. Test tunnelling took place, but these plans, too, had to be shelved when the Second World War broke out.\u000aSevere war damage caused the Stadtbahn system to be suspended in some areas until 27 May 1945. The redevelopment of stations took until the 1950s. Meanwhile, Vienna was occupied by the four allied powers until 1955, and in 1946 had returned three quarters of the pre-war expanded Greater Vienna to the state of Lower Austria. Two proposals for U-Bahn systems were nonetheless presented, in 1953 and 1954. Increasing car traffic led to cutbacks in the S-Bahn network that were partially made up for by buses. The U-Bahn issue was also politicised: in the 1954 and 1959 city council elections, the conservative Austrian People's Party championed construction of a U-Bahn, but the more powerful Social Democratic Party of Austria campaigned for putting housing first. The city council repeatedly rejected the U-Bahn idea in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\u000aExtensions of the Stadtbahn system had always been discussed as an alternative to building a new U-Bahn. But it was not until the late 1960s, when the Stadtbahn and the Schnellbahn were no longer able to adequately serve the ever-increasing public traffic, that the decision to build a new network was taken. On 26 January 1968, the city council voted to begin construction of a 30 km basic network (Grundnetz). Construction began on 3 November 1969 on and under Karlsplatz, where three lines of the basic network were to meet, and where central control of the U-Bahn was located. Test operation began on 8 May 1976 on line U4, and the first newly constructed (underground) stretch of line opened on 25 February 1978 (five stations on U1 between Reumannplatz and Karlsplatz).\u000aThe construction of the Vienna U-Bahn network can be divided into several stages:\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Initial construction (1969\u20131982): Basic network (Grundnetz) ===\u000a\u000aFirst, the basic network (Grundnetz) was chosen from the various network designs. During 1967, plans for the U2 were radically reduced and the U3 completely deleted, and the approved basic network was described as a 'closer basic network'. This closer basic network, consisting of the U1, U2 and U4 lines, included:\u000aNew route between Reumannplatz and Praterstern\u000aU2 between Karlsplatz and Schottenring\u000aU4 between Hütteldorf and Heiligenstadt, consisting almost entirely of modification and adaptation of the existing Stadtbahn line\u000aConstruction began on 3 November 1969. On 25 February 1978, the first Vienna U-Bahn route between Karlsplatz and Reumannplatz, the U1, went into operation. With twelve partial commissionings, the Vienna U-Bahn basic network was completed on 3 September 1982.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Second expansion phase (1982\u20132000): Lines U3 and U6 ===\u000a\u000aThe second phase involved the expansion of the U3 and U6 lines (about 61 km, (37.9 mi)). The groundbreaking ceremony for this phase took place on 7 September 1983 on Pottendsdorfer Street at the Philadelphia Bridge and after six years, the central section of the U6 between Philadelphia Bridge and Heligenstadt/Friedensbrücke went into operation.\u000aBy mid-1990, the U6 had been extended from Siebenhirten to Floridsdorf and the U3 from Simmering to Ottakring constructed.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Third expansion phase (2001\u20132010): The first extensions of U1 and U2 ===\u000a\u000aIn 1996, a new U-Bahn contract, known as the "30 billion package", was settled. For the first time in Europe, a U-Bahn project had to undergo a costly and lengthy environmental impact assessment, as the U2 extension showed a length of more than 10 km (6.2 mi). This expansion phase involved:\u000a\u000a\u000a==== U1 extension to Leopoldau ====\u000aOn 19 October 2001, the groundbreaking ceremony for the extension of U1 was held, for which the two districts had been waiting for 20 years. After five years of construction, the 4.6 km (2.9 mi) long extension of the U1 was opened on 2 September 2006.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== U2 extension from Schottenring to Stadium ====\u000aOn 12 June 2003, the groundbreaking ceremony took place outside the Stadion (stadium). Because of the 2008 European Football Championships in Austria, there was enormous pressure to complete the construction on time. The Wiener Linien met the deadline, and on 10 May 2008 the U2 extension to the stadium was opened.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== U2 extension from Stadium to Aspern ====\u000aOn 2 October 2010, a further six stations were opened taking the U2 across the Danube via Donaustadtbrücke to Aspernstrasse in the twenty-second district (Donaustadt). An additional 4.2 kilometers (2.6 mi), three station extension of the U2 to Aspern Seestadt was officially opened on 5 October 2013.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Timeline ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== U-Bahn network ==\u000aWith the opening in October 2013 of the 4.2-kilometer (2.6 mi), three-station extension of the U2 line, the U-Bahn consists of 78.5 kilometers (48.8 mi) of route. With the U2 extension, the five U-Bahn lines (U1-U4 and U6) now serve 104 stations, including nine interchanges. Further extensions of the Vienna U-Bahn are scheduled to be completed by 2019. Upon completion, there will then be a network that is 90 kilometers (56 mi) long with 116 stations. Some plans have been proposed for the system beyond 2019, although such plans are currently unfunded.\u000aU-Bahn services run between 05:00 and around 01:00 at intervals between two and five minutes during the day and up to eight after 20:00. Since 4 September 2010, there has been a 24-hour service operating at a 15-minute interval in the nights between Fridays\u2013Saturdays, Saturdays\u2013Sundays, and in the nights prior to a public holiday. The 24-hour U-Bahn is supplemented in these nights by Vienna NightLine bus services.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Stations ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Projected expansion ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Fourth expansion phase (2010\u20132017): Further extension of the Vienna U-Bahn ===\u000aPlanning for a fourth U-Bahn expansion phase began in 2001 and concrete ideas were put forth in the 2003 Transport Master Plan. Two projects have been completed:\u000aU2 extension from Aspernstraße to Flugfeld Aspern (Seestadt). The former airfield at Aspern is transforming in three major stages into the "Lakeside City" of Vienna. Opening of the completed extension to Aspern took place on 5 October 2013. Instead of calling the extension "Flugfeld Aspern", it was instead changed to "Seestadt", the name of the lakeside city.\u000aU1 extension, 4.6 kilometers (2.9 mi) from Reumannplatz to Oberlaa. It was completed and opened on September 2, 2017, as planned.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Fifth expansion phase (2018\u20132023): New U5 line ===\u000aThe fifth expansion phase will involve dividing the existing U2 line at Rathaus Station into two lines and then extending each of them. The section of the U2 line from Rathaus to Karlsplatz will be upgraded for driverless operation and become part of the new U5 line, which will extend from Rathaus to Elterleinplatz via an interchange with the U6 at Michelbeuern AKH. The rump U2 line will be extended from Rathaus to Wienerberg via interchanges with the U3 at Neubaugasse and the U4 at Pilgramgasse. The U5 line will be Vienna's first driverless U-Bahn line.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Rolling stock ==\u000aThe Vienna U-Bahn has three types of rolling stock, and has maintenance of way equipment. The U1, U2, U3, and U4 have two types of rolling stock: the older U/U1/U2 type (introduced in 1972) and the newer V type (introduced in 2002). The U6 has one class of train, the T/T1 type (introduced in 1993), the older E6/C6 having been retired in 2008 and which now mostly operate in Utrecht in the Netherlands and Kraków in Poland, with a single set being preserved at the Vienna Streetcar Museum.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Art ==\u000aIn common with many urban transit systems, the Vienna U-Bahn has art works in stations. These include:\u000aAspern Nord: Aspern Affairs, two big artistic maps of Vienna at the end of the platform, one of 1809, where Napoleon has lived and one of 1912, where the airport in Aspern (at the time the biggest airport in Europe) had seen. Also there are colored "livelines" above the tracks that shoe the names of famous people, and their birth and death dates. The art was created by Stephan Huber. Also, the main entrance of the station has a big flight roof.\u000aErdberg: Mosaics Stadteinwärts and Stadtauswärts by Peter Atanasov\u000aHütteldorfer Straße: U-BauAlphabet by Georg Salner\u000aJohnstraße: übertragung by Michael Schneider\u000aKarlsplatz: Pi by Ken Lum\u000aKarlsplatz: Spatial installation by Peter Kogler\u000aKarlsplatz: Frieze Unisono di colori by Ernst Friedrich und Eleonor Friedrich\u000aLandstraße: E-mail wall by Oswald Oberhuber\u000aLandstraße: Planet der Pendler mit den drei Zeitmonden by Kurt Hofstetter\u000aLaurenzgasse: Mural by Heimo Zobernig\u000aMuseumsquartier: Lauf der Geschöpfe, Der Jubilierende, Wächter, Lebenskeim and Tor des Verborgenen by Rudi Wach\u000aOttakring: U-Turn by Margot Pilz\u000aOttakring: Graffiti wall by Wiener Graffiti Union\u000aPraterstern: Einen Traum träumen und ihn mit anderen teilen ... by Susanne Zemrosser\u000aSchottentor: varying installations in glass case\u000aSchweglerstraße: Kunst der Technik by Nam June Paik\u000aStadlau: Nepomuk by Werner Feiersinger\u000aStubentor: Bewegungen der Seele by Michael Hedwig\u000aSüdtiroler Platz - Hauptbahnhof: SUED by Franz Graf\u000aTaborstraße: ein Garten (zum Beispiel) by Ingeborg Strobl\u000aVolkstheater: Das Werden der Natur by Anton Lehmden\u000aWestbahnhof: Cirka 55 Schritte durch Europa by Adolf Frohner\u000aZippererstraße: Kid's Kunst - Mobilität im kommenden Jahrtausend (children's art)\u000aRochusgasse: Roman archaeological remains\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aVienna S-Bahn\u000aTrams in Vienna\u000aList of metro systems\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Inline references ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Books ===\u000aGerman\u000aJohann Hödl: Das Wiener U-Bahn Netz, Wiener Linien, 2009\u000aJohann Walter Hinkel: U-Bahnen von 1863 bis 2010, N.J.

aVLorraine Bethel is an African-American lesbian feminist poet and author. She is a graduate of Yale University. Bethel has taught and lectured on black women's literature and black female culture at various institutions. She currently works as a freelance journalist in New York City. She participated in the Combahee River Collective, an organization that was part of the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement in the 1960s and 1970s. The Combahee River Collective was a black feminist group founded in Boston in 1974. It fought against racial, sexual, heterosexual, and class oppression.\u000aIn an issue of Off Our Backs, a feminist news journal, a participant recounts her experience in the 3rd World Lesbian Writers Conference on February 24, 1979 at New York City\u2019s Women\u2019s Center, in which Lorraine Bethel and Barbara Smith moderated one of the five workshops available. In their workshop, called \u201c3rd World Feminist Criticism\u201d, Bethel and Smith discussed various topics such as the definition of \u201ccriticism\u201d, criticism as a \u201ccreative\u201d art, white feminism versus black feminism, intersectional feminism, and the unification of black lesbians.\u000aLater that year, in November 1979, Lorraine Bethel and Barbara Smith guest-edited \u201cThe Black Women\u2019s Issue\u201d of Conditions: Five, a literary magazine primarily for black lesbian women. In the introduction, it is stated that the issue \u201cdisproves the \u2018non-existence\u2019 of Black feminist and Black lesbian writers and challenges forever our invisibility, particularly in the feminist press.\u201d (Conditions: Five). Bethel wrote the poem, \u201cWhat Chou Mean We, White Girl? Or, The Cullud Lesbian Feminist Declaration of Independence\u201d, which was published in this issue. Deborah E.

aVPersonal injury is a legal term for an injury to the body, mind or emotions, as opposed to an injury to property.\u000aIn Anglo-American jurisdictions the term is most commonly used to refer to a type of tort lawsuit in which the person bringing the suit, or "plaintiff," has suffered harm to his or her body or mind. Personal injury lawsuits are filed against the person or entity that caused the harm through negligence, gross negligence, reckless conduct, or intentional misconduct, and in some cases on the basis of strict liability. Different jurisdictions describe the damages (or, the things for which the injured person may be compensated) in different ways, but damages typically include the injured person's medical bills, pain and suffering, and diminished quality of life.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Types ==\u000a\u000aCommon types of personal injury claims include road traffic accidents, work accidents, tripping accidents, assault claims, and product defect accidents (product liability). The term personal injury also incorporates medical and dental accidents (which may lead to medical negligence claims ) and conditions that are often classified as industrial disease cases, including asbestosis and peritoneal mesothelioma, chest diseases (e.g., emphysema, pneumoconiosis, silicosis, chronic bronchitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic obstructive airways disease), vibration white finger, occupational deafness, occupational stress, contact dermatitis, and repetitive strain injury cases. Of these, the most common are automobile collisions. Personal injury cases may also include toxic torts, in which a contaminant transmitted by air or water causes illness, injury, or death (as in John Grisham's book, A Civil Action).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Claims and payments ==\u000aDepending upon the intent or negligence of a responsible party, the injured party may be entitled to monetary compensation from that party through a settlement or a judgment.\u000aAlthough personal injury cases may result from an intentional act, such as defamation, or from reckless conduct, most personal injury claims are based on a theory of negligence. To hold a party or parties legally liable for injuries so damages based upon negligence, four elements must be proved:\u000aThe party had a duty to act reasonably according to the circumstances.\u000aThe party breached the duty.\u000aThe party\u2019s breach of the duty caused you to be harmed.\u000aYou suffered monetary damages due to the harm you suffered when the party breached its duty of care.\u000aThe amount of compensation for a personal injury will primarily depend on the severity of the injury. Serious injuries (such as broken bones, severed limbs, brain damage) that cause intense physical pain and suffering receive the highest injury settlements.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Lawsuits ===\u000aAs occurs in most civil cases, personal injury cases begin by filing with a court a document called a "complaint." Typically, a complaint in a personal injury case identifies the parties to the lawsuit, specifies what the defendant did wrong, alleges that the wrongdoing caused the plaintiff's injury, and specifies what kind of compensation the plaintiff is seeking. The complaint generally sets out the facts that the plaintiff will attempt to prove, and the defendant may attempt to disprove, throughout the litigation.\u000aIn most countries, payments will be through a settlement agreement or a judgment as a result of a trial. Settlements can be either lump-sum or as a structured settlement in which the payments are made over a period of time.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Legal fees ===\u000aThe manner in which attorneys are compensated for their representation of injured plaintiffs varies by jurisdiction. For example, in the United States, attorneys often represent clients on a "contingent fee basis" in which the attorney's fee is a percentage of the plaintiff's eventual compensation, payable when the case is resolved, with no payment necessary if the case is unsuccessful. Depending upon state regulations, a plaintiff's attorney may charge 1/3 of the proceeds recovered if a case is settled out of court or 40 percent if the matter must be litigated. Attorney fees are negotiable before hiring an attorney.\u000aAlthough some jurisdictions have historically helped people obtain affordable legal representation, those systems have typically been narrowed and may exclude personal injury cases. For Example, in England legal aid from the government was largely abolished in the late 1990s and replaced with arrangements whereby the client would be charged no fee if her or his case was unsuccessful.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Time limitation ===\u000aMany jurisdictions have statutes of limitations - laws that determine how much time you have to file a claim. If a lawsuit is not filed in a timely manner the statute of limitations provides a defense that can allow the defendant to have the case dismissed with no compensation to the plaintiff.\u000aIn England and Wales, under the limitation rules, where an individual is bringing a claim for compensation, court proceedings must be commenced within 3 years of the date of the accident, failing which the claimant will lose the right to bring his or her claim. However, injured parties who were under the age of 18 at the time of their accidents have until the day prior to their 21st birthdays to commence proceedings. A court has the discretion to extend or waive the limitation period if it is considered equitable to do so. Another exception is if the accident caused an injury, as an example industrial deafness, then the three-year period will start from when injured party knew or ought to have known that he or she had a claim.\u000aIn the United States, each state has different statutes of limitation, and within a state different types of injuries may have different statutes of limitation. Rape claims, for example, often have a much longer statute of limitation than other injuries. In some states such as Colorado, the statute of limitations starts to run once the injury is discovered. For example, if you were in a car accident and then 6 months later started having severe back problems, the statute would start when you noticed the injury.\u000aIn India, in case of motor vehicle accidents there is no time limitation for bringing a claim for compensation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Damages ==\u000a\u000aDamages are categorized as either special or general. In torts, special damages are measurable costs which can be itemized such as medical expenses, lost earnings, and property damages whereas general damages include less measurable costs such as pain and suffering, loss of consortium, the effects of defamation, and emotional distress. Personal injury torts may result in claims for both special and general damages.\u000aAside from compensation for injuries, the injured person may get compensated for the lifetime effect of the injuries. An example, a keen cricketer suffers a wrist injury which prevents him from playing cricket during the cricket season. This is called loss of enjoyment of life and is compensable. Additionally, lost earning capacity (Future ability to learn) and future reasonably necessary medical expenses are recoverable.\u000aIn some cases, the injured might run his or her own businesses. The quantum assessment of the loss of profits (dividing into pre-trial and post-trial) requires forensic accounting expertise because the forensic accountant would consider various scenarios and adopt the best estimate based on the available objective data.\u000a\u000a\u000a== No-fault compensation fund ==\u000aSome jurisdictions offer no fault compensation systems for personal injury cases, or types of personal injury cases, whereby an injured person can recover compensation from a fund or insurance program without regard to who is at fault for the person's injury. For example, in the United States, most injuries that occur while the injured person is working for an employer are compensated through a no-fault workers' compensation system. In New Zealand, the Accident Compensation Corporation provides no-fault compensation to all accident victims (including medical malpractice), and personal injury lawsuits are rare (except in cases of reckless conduct). Proponents of this system say that it results in faster, fairer awards to victims. In practice, it allows people to engage in behavior they otherwise wouldn't out of fear of legal liability, such as putting out a trampoline for neighborhood kids to use.\u000a\u000a\u000a== United States ==\u000aPersonal injury cases represent the most common type of lawsuits filed in United States federal district courts, representing 25.5 percent of cases filed in 2015. Personal injury claims represent a considerably smaller percentage of cases filed in state courts. For example, in Illinois, tort claims represent approximately 7% of the civil docket.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Insurance ===\u000a\u000aIn the United States, personal injury in the sense of "bodily injury" to others is often covered by liability insurance. Most businesses carry commercial general liability policies. Different states have different rules regarding auto insurance, but generally, a driver's liability insurance is available to compensate others whom that driver may inadvertently injure, and uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage is available to compensate the driver for injuries inflicted upon the driver by someone else. Therefore, an insurance company will provide a legal defense to the defendant and may settle with the plaintiff (victim).\u000aAdditional damages for mental injury without a physical injury are less clearly covered, as the insurance policy typically states that it covers only bodily injury. For example, in general liability as of 2001 a minority of courts included emotional distress within the definition bodily injury. Where a mental injury arises from a physical injury\u2014as with a traumatic brain injury caused by a car accident\u2014auto insurance policies normally cover the injury.\u000aIn insurance, "personal injury," as typically defined, does not include mental injury that occurs as a result of defamation, false arrest or imprisonment, or malicious prosecution. For example, the Insurance Services Office standard general liability form has a section providing this coverage. Some home insurance policies include personal injury coverage.\u000aDespite the general distinction between bodily injury and personal injury in insurance contracts, auto insurance known as personal injury protection (PIP) does cover medical expenses from bodily injury. This type of insurance is available in some states, but not others.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Taxation of personal injury settlements ===\u000aIn the United States, for federal taxes payable to the IRS, the money awarded in a personal injury settlement as compensation for pain and suffering, medical expenses and property damage is not ordinarily taxable. Exceptions may apply, for example, if a plaintiff took a tax deduction in a prior year for medical expenses that are recovered through a later judgment or settlement. \u000aCompensation for lost wages or lost business profits will typically be taxed.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aAssociation of Personal Injury Lawyers\u000aBig Apple Pothole and Sidewalk Protection Committee\u000aPain and suffering\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==

aVThe Iranian languages, or Iranic languages, are a branch of the Indo-Iranian languages, which in turn are a branch of the Indo-European language family. The speakers of Iranian languages are known as Iranian peoples. Historical Iranian languages are grouped in three stages: Old Iranian (until 400 BC), Middle Iranian (400 BC \u2013 900 AD) and New Iranian (since 900 AD). Of the Old Iranian languages, the better understood and recorded ones are Old Persian (a language of Achaemenid Iran) and Avestan (the language of the Avesta). Middle Iranian languages included Middle Persian (a language of Sassanid Iran), Parthian and Bactrian.\u000aAs of 2008, there were an estimated 150\u2013200 million native speakers of Iranian languages. Ethnologue estimates that there are 86 Iranian languages, the largest among them being Persian, Pashto, Balochi and the Kurdish dialect continuum.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Term ==\u000a\u000aThe term Iranian is applied to any language which descends from the ancestral Proto-Iranian language. Iranian derives from the Persian and Sanskrit origin word Arya.\u000aThe use of the term for the Iranian language family was introduced in 1836 by Christian Lassen. Robert Needham Cust used the term Irano-Aryan in 1878, and Orientalists such as George Abraham Grierson and Max Müller contrasted Irano-Aryan (Iranian) and Indo-Aryan (Indic). Some recent scholarship, primarily in German, has revived this convention.\u000aThe Iranian languages are divided into the following branches:\u000aThe Western Iranian languages subdivided into:\u000aSouthwestern, of which Persian is the dominant member;\u000aNorthwestern, of which the Kurdish languages are the dominant members.\u000a\u000aThe Eastern Iranian languages subdivided into:\u000aSoutheastern, of which Pashto is the dominant member;\u000aNortheastern, by far the smallest branch, of which Ossetian is the dominant member.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Classification ==\u000aWestern\u000a\u000aNorthwestern\u000aNorthwestern I\u000aKurdish\u000aKurmanji - 15 million speakers\u000aSorani - 7 million speakers\u000aPalewani - 3 million speakers\u000a\u000aZaza-Gorani\u000aZaza - 1.6 million speakers\u000aGorani - 250,000 speakers\u000a\u000aNorthwestern II\u000aBalochi - 30 million speakers\u000aKhuri\u000aTatic\u000aTalysh - 900,000 speakers\u000aTati - 248,000 speakers\u000aAshtiani - 21,000 speakers\u000aCentral\u000aNorthwestern\u000aKhunsari - 21,000 speakers\u000aMahallati\u000a\u000aSouthwestern\u000aGazi - 7,000 speakers\u000aSedehi\u000a\u000aNortheastern\u000aArani\u000aBidgoli\u000a\u000aSoutheastern\u000aZoroastrian Dari - 8,000 speakers\u000aNayini - 7,000 speakers\u000a\u000aNorthwestern III\u000aSemnani\u000aSemnani proper - 60,000 speakers\u000aSangsari - 36,000 speakers\u000aLasgerdi - 1,000 speakers\u000aSorkhei - 10,000 speakers\u000a\u000aCaspian\u000aGilaki - 4 million speakers\u000aMazanderani - 6 million speakers\u000a\u000aSouthwestern\u000aPersian (including Dari and Tajik) - 80 million speakers\u000aPersid\u000aDezfuli\u000aLuri - 13 million\u000aSivandi - 3,000 speakers\u000aNorthwestern Fars - 7,500 speakers\u000aKuhmareyi - 100,000 speakers\u000a\u000aLarestani-Gulf\u000aAchomi - 210,000 speakers\u000aBashkardi - 7,000 speakers\u000aKumzari - 2,300 speakers\u000aBandari\u000aMinabi\u000a\u000aEastern\u000a\u000aPashto - 60 million speakers\u000aPamir\u000aWakhi - 58,000 speakers\u000aShugni-Yazgulami\u000aShughni - 75,000 speakers\u000aSarikoli - 16,000 speakers\u000aYazghulami - 9,000 speakers\u000a\u000aMunji-Yidgha\u000aMunji - 5,300 speakers\u000aYidgha - 6,200 speakers\u000a\u000aSanglechi-Ishkashimi\u000aSanglechi - 2,200 speakers\u000aIshkashimi - 3,000 speakers\u000a\u000aOrmuri-Parachi\u000aOrmuri - 6,000 speakers\u000aParachi - 3,500 speakers\u000a\u000aNorthern\u000aYaghnobi - 12,000 speakers\u000aOssetian - 570,000 speakers\u000a\u000a\u000a== Proto-Iranian ==\u000a\u000aAll Iranian languages are descended from a common ancestor, Proto-Iranian. In turn, and together with Proto-Indo-Aryan and the Nuristani languages, Proto-Iranian descends from a common ancestor Proto-Indo-Iranian. The Indo-Iranian languages are thought to have originated in Central Asia. The Andronovo culture is the suggested candidate for the common Indo-Iranian culture ca. 2000 BC.\u000aIt was situated precisely in the western part of Central Asia that borders present-day Russia (and present-day Kazakhstan). It was in relative proximity to the other satem ethno-linguistic groups of the Indo-European family, like Thracian, Balto-Slavic and others, and to common Indo-European's original homeland (more precisely, the steppes of southern Russia to the north of the Caucasus), according to the reconstructed linguistic relationships of common Indo-European.\u000aProto-Iranian thus dates to some time after Proto-Indo-Iranian break-up, or the early second millennium BCE, as the Old Iranian languages began to break off and evolve separately as the various Iranian tribes migrated and settled in vast areas of southeastern Europe, the Iranian plateau, and Central Asia.\u000aInnovations of Proto-Iranian compared to Proto-Indo-Iranian include (from Witzel, 2001):\u000a*s other than *[\u0283] turns into *[h]\u000a*b\u02b0, *d\u02b0, *g\u02b0 merge into *b, *d, *g\u000aFricativization of voiceless stops\u000a*p, *t, *k become *f, *\u03b8, *x before another consonant\u000ain all positions, *p\u02b0, *t\u02b0, *k\u02b0 become *f, *\u03b8, *x\u000a\u000a\u000a== Old Iranian ==\u000aThe multitude of Middle Iranian languages and peoples indicate that great linguistic diversity must have existed among the ancient speakers of Iranian languages. Of that variety of languages/dialects, direct evidence of only two have survived. These are:\u000aAvestan, the two languages/dialects of the Avesta, i.e. the liturgical texts of Zoroastrianism.\u000aOld Persian, the native language of a south-western Iranian people known as Persians.\u000aIndirectly attested Old Iranian languages are discussed below.\u000aOld Persian is the Old Iranian dialect as it was spoken in south-western Iran by the inhabitants of Parsa, who also gave their name to their region and language. Genuine Old Persian is best attested in one of the three languages of the Behistun inscription, composed circa 520 BC, and which is the last inscription (and only inscription of significant length) in which Old Persian is still grammatically correct. Later inscriptions are comparatively brief, and typically simply copies of words and phrases from earlier ones, often with grammatical errors, which suggests that by the 4th century BC the transition from Old Persian to Middle Persian was already far advanced, but efforts were still being made to retain an "old" quality for official proclamations.\u000aThe other directly attested Old Iranian dialects are the two forms of Avestan, which take their name from their use in the Avesta, the liturgical texts of indigenous Iranian religion that now goes by the name of Zoroastrianism but in the Avesta itself is simply known as vohu daena (later: behdin). The language of the Avesta is subdivided into two dialects, conventionally known as "Old (or 'Gathic') Avestan", and "Younger Avestan". These terms, which date to the 19th century, are slightly misleading since 'Younger Avestan' is not only much younger than 'Old Avestan', but also from a different geographic region. The Old Avestan dialect is very archaic, and at roughly the same stage of development as Rigvedic Sanskrit. On the other hand, Younger Avestan is at about the same linguistic stage as Old Persian, but by virtue of its use as a sacred language retained its "old" characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had yielded to their Middle Iranian stage. Unlike Old Persian, which has Middle Persian as its known successor, Avestan has no clearly identifiable Middle Iranian stage (the effect of Middle Iranian is indistinguishable from effects due to other causes).\u000aIn addition to Old Persian and Avestan, which are the only directly attested Old Iranian languages, all Middle Iranian languages must have had a predecessor "Old Iranian" form of that language, and thus can all be said to have had an (at least hypothetical) "Old" form. Such hypothetical Old Iranian languages include Carduchian (the hypothetical predecessor to Kurdish) and Old Parthian. Additionally, the existence of unattested languages can sometimes be inferred from the impact they had on neighbouring languages. Such transfer is known to have occurred for Old Persian, which has (what is called) a "Median" substrate in some of its vocabulary. Also, foreign references to languages can also provide a hint to the existence of otherwise unattested languages, for example through toponyms/ethnonyms or in the recording of vocabulary, as Herodotus did for what he called "Scythian".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Isoglosses ===\u000aConventionally, Iranian languages are grouped in "western" and "eastern" branches. These terms have little meaning with respect to Old Avestan as that stage of the language may predate the settling of the Iranian peoples into western and eastern groups. The geographic terms also have little meaning when applied to Younger Avestan since it isn't known where that dialect (or dialects) was spoken either. Certain is only that Avestan (all forms) and Old Persian are distinct, and since Old Persian is "western", and Avestan was not Old Persian, Avestan acquired a default assignment to "eastern". Confusing the issue is the introduction of a western Iranian substrate in later Avestan compositions and redactions undertaken at the centers of imperial power in western Iran (either in the south-west in Persia, or in the north-west in Nisa/Parthia and Ecbatana/Media).\u000aTwo of the earliest dialectal divisions among Iranian indeed happen to not follow the later division into Western and Eastern blocks. These concern the fate of the Proto-Indo-Iranian first-series palatal consonants, *\u0107 and *d\u017a:\u000aAvestan and most other Iranian languages have deaffricated and depalatalized these consonants, and have *\u0107 > s, *d\u017a > z.\u000aOld Persian, however, has fronted these consonants further: *\u0107 > \u03b8, *d\u017a > *ð > d.\u000aAs a common intermediate stage, it is possible to reconstruct depalatalized affricates: *c, *dz. (This coincides with the state of affairs in the neighboring Nuristani languages.) A further complication however concerns the consonant clusters *\u0107w and *d\u017aw:\u000aAvestan and most other Iranian languages have shifted these clusters to sp, zb.\u000aIn Old Persian, these clusters yield s, z, with loss of the glide *w, but without further fronting.\u000aThe Saka language, attested in the Middle Iranian period, and its modern relative Wakhi fail to fit into either group: in these, palatalization remains, and similar glide loss as in Old Persian occurs: *\u0107w > \u0161, *d\u017aw > \u017e.\u000aA division of Iranian languages in at least three groups during the Old Iranian period is thus implied:\u000aPersid (Old Persian and its descendants)\u000aSakan (Saka, Wakhi, and their Old Iranian ancestor)\u000aCentral Iranian (all other Iranian languages)\u000aIt is possible that other distinct dialect groups were already in existence during this period. Good candidates are the hypothethical ancestor languages of Alanian/Scytho-Sarmatian subgroup of Scythian in the far northwest; and the hypothetical "Old Parthian" (the Old Iranian ancestor of Parthian) in the near northwest, where original *dw > *b (paralleling the development of *\u0107w).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Middle Iranian languages ==\u000aWhat is known in Iranian linguistic history as the "Middle Iranian" era is thought to begin around the 4th century BCE lasting through the 9th century. Linguistically the Middle Iranian languages are conventionally classified into two main groups, Western and Eastern.\u000aThe Western family includes Parthian (Arsacid Pahlavi) and Middle Persian, while Bactrian, Sogdian, Khwarezmian, Saka, and Old Ossetic (Scytho-Sarmatian) fall under the Eastern category. The two languages of the Western group were linguistically very close to each other, but quite distinct from their eastern counterparts. On the other hand, the Eastern group was an areal entity whose languages retained some similarity to Avestan. They were inscribed in various Aramaic-derived alphabets which had ultimately evolved from the Achaemenid Imperial Aramaic script, though Bactrian was written using an adapted Greek script.\u000aMiddle Persian (Pahlavi) was the official language under the Sasanian dynasty in Iran. It was in use from the 3rd century CE until the beginning of the 10th century. The script used for Middle Persian in this era underwent significant maturity. Middle Persian, Parthian and Sogdian were also used as literary languages by the Manichaeans, whose texts also survive in various non-Iranian languages, from Latin to Chinese. Manichaean texts were written in a script closely akin to the Syriac script.\u000a\u000a\u000a== New Iranian languages ==\u000a\u000aFollowing the Islamic Conquest of Persia (Iran), there were important changes in the role of the different dialects within the Persian Empire. The old prestige form of Middle Iranian, also known as Pahlavi, was replaced by a new standard dialect called Dari as the official language of the court. The name Dari comes from the word darbâr (\u062f\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0631), which refers to the royal court, where many of the poets, protagonists, and patrons of the literature flourished. The Saffarid dynasty in particular was the first in a line of many dynasties to officially adopt the new language in 875 CE. Dari may have been heavily influenced by regional dialects of eastern Iran, whereas the earlier Pahlavi standard was based more on western dialects. This new prestige dialect became the basis of Standard New Persian. Medieval Iranian scholars such as Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa (8th century) and Ibn al-Nadim (10th century) associated the term "Dari" with the eastern province of Khorasan, while they used the term "Pahlavi" to describe the dialects of the northwestern areas between Isfahan and Azerbaijan, and "Pârsi" ("Persian" proper) to describe the Dialects of Fars. They also noted that the unofficial language of the royalty itself was yet another dialect, "Khuzi", associated with the western province of Khuzestan.\u000a\u000aThe Islamic conquest also brought with it the adoption of Arabic script for writing Persian and much later, Kurdish, Pashto and Balochi. All three were adapted to the writing by the addition of a few letters. This development probably occurred some time during the second half of the 8th century, when the old middle Persian script began dwindling in usage. The Arabic script remains in use in contemporary modern Persian. Tajik script, used to write the Tajik language, was first Latinised in the 1920s under the then Soviet nationality policy. The script was however subsequently Cyrillicized in the 1930s by the Soviet government.\u000aThe geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus. Various small Iranian languages in the Pamir Mountains survive that are derived from Eastern Iranian.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Comparison table ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aIndo-Iranian languages\u000aIranian peoples\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aSociety for Iranian Linguistics\u000aKurdish and other Iranic Languages\u000aIranian EFL Journal\u000aAudio and video recordings for over 50 languages spoken in Iran\u000aIranian language tree in Russian, identical with above classification.\u000aOld Iranian Lessons (free online through the Linguistics Research Center at UT Austin)

aV"Make Me" is a song by American singer-songwriter Janet Jackson included on her second greatest hits compilation Number Ones (2009). The song was written by Jackson, Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins, Thomas Lumpkins, and Michaela Shiloh. Initially presented as an audio stream to those who joined her web site's official mailing list in September 2009, it was released via digital download later that month, on September 22, 2009, as the lead and only single from Number Ones by A&M Records.\u000a"Make Me" features an up-tempo disco beat and lyrical hook reminiscent of her material from the 1980s. The song received critical praise, with music critics comparing the song favorably to her hit "All for You" (2001) and her brother Michael Jackson's 1979 number one single "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough", both of which carry a distinct disco beat. It became her 19th number one hit single on the Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart, and made her the first artist to earn number one singles on the chart across four decades. The song's music video, directed by Robert Hales, was shot entirely in black and white, and it received positive critical reception for its vintage aesthetic.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Background ==\u000aIn 2009, the 26th Annual MTV Video Music Awards were held a few months after Jackson's brother Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009. The awards dedicated the night to her brother with a retro-music video montage, and American singer Madonna opened the show with a speech about Jackson. Additionally, Janet Jackson made an appearance to perform the 1995 song "Scream". Following the awards show on September 13, 2009, a song titled "Make Me" was released on Jackson's official website as an audio stream for those who joined the site's e-mail newsletter. On September 22, it was released as a digital download for purchase. Although claims were made that "Make Me" is a tribute song to Michael's 1979 single "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough", Jackson later stated in an interview with Ryan Seacrest it is not, despite the similarity of the lyrics in the song's outro.\u000a"Make Me" was written by Janet Jackson, Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins, Thomas Lumpkins, and Michaela Shiloh. Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers have also been credited as the song samples Fonzi Thornton's song "I Work For A Livin'", written and produced by them for the 1982 Soup For One motion picture soundtrack. Darkchild, who produced music from Jackson's tenth studio album Discipline (2008), co-produced the song with her. He reported to MTV that he had been working on new material with Jackson since her departure from Island Records in September 2008. Of the new material, he commented, "It's about dancing ... It's all about her. It's about [saying], 'Listen, if you really want to get with me, you gotta make me feel a certain way' ... We're going back to basics and fundamental sounds of Janet. We're trying to target her fans [by making] the records that her fans will embrace." In October 2009, Universal Music Enterprises issued a press release stating "Make Me" would be included in Jackson's second greatest hits album, Number Ones, a compilation of her 33 global number one singles.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reception ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Critical reception ===\u000aFollowing her performance at the VMA's, Gil Kaufman of MTV reported, "Janet gave the ultimate thank you to her beloved sibling by posting a new single, 'Make Me,' on her Web site ... Easing up on the darker S&M themes of her recent albums, 'Make Me' is a fun, breezy tune with an elastic disco beat" adding that "[t]he chorus twists Michael's refrain into a Janet-worthy, sexy come-on, with the lyrics, 'Don't stop 'til you get it up'." Clover Hope of Vibe magazine commented: "Fun, rhythmic, buoyant\u2014it's the type of rebound we'd hoped for with 2008's Discipline, where Jackson teamed up with Rodney Jerkins in search of a youthful edge that only seemed to date her. They got it right here though, as Jerkins taps into Janet's sense of fanciful pleasure, rewinding time in a Janet way." Jerkins also had Larry Ryckman and Ari Blitz Master "Make Me" with AfterMaster HD Audio which gave it a uniquely powerful presence. Michael Menachem of Billboard magazine hailed the song as her best dance recording since "All for You" (2001). Noting the single's similarity to Michael Jackson's disco themed "Don't Stop Til You Get Enough" from Off the Wall, Menachem comments "[it] isn't just Jackson's best dance song in years\u2014it's a hit that would make her brother proud." Glenn Gamboa of Newsday referred to the single as "remarkably upbeat, blending a bit of the playfulness that has been missing in her recent work with a high-energy Euro-dance backdrop."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Chart performance ===\u000aEntering at number fifty, "Make Me" became her nineteenth number one hit single on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. It became her 19th number one hit single on the chart, and made her the first artist to earn number one singles on the chart across four decades. Following its peak on the Dance/Club chart, it entered the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs at number ninety-one, eventually peaking at number seventy-one. In the UK, the single become her first release since her collaboration with Nelly on "Call on Me" in 2006 to chart inside the Top 75.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Music video ==\u000aA music video for the song was directed by Robert Hales and choreographed by Gil Duldulao. It premiered on 20/20 on November 20, 2009. Nick Levine from Digital Spy commented: "There's lots of dancing, Janet looks fantastic and the whole thing's as slick as a classic Jam & Lewis groove. In short? A thoroughly enjoyable way to spend the next three-and-a-half-minutes. Right, back to 'Escapade' for us". Jefferson Reid and Lindsay Miller of E! Online stated the video "features a vintage Janet vibe, including space-age shoulder pads and countless hat-tips to brother Michael."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Live performances ==\u000aWhile promoting her second greatest hits album Number Ones, the singer performed an eight-minute medley of six hits during the American Music Awards of 2009. It included "Control", "Miss You Much", "What Have You Done for Me Lately", "If", "Make Me", and finished with "Together Again". At the end of the performance, the singer received applause and standing ovation from the audience. Jackson also performed the track on The X Factor results show on December 6, 2009. She pre-recorded the performance so she could perform as the headliner of the Jingle Bell Ball in London. She closed the concert with a medley of her greatest hits including "Make Me", wearing half hareem-pant, half skirt concoction, jackets and high-top trainers. Jackson also included the song in her performance at the 2010 Essence Music Festival, held in New Orleans, Louisiana. The song was also included on the Number Ones: Up Close and Personal tour which happened the following year.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Track listing ==\u000aDigital download\u000a"Make Me" (Album Version) - 3:38\u000a"Make Me" (Moto Blanco Club Mix) - 7:11\u000a"Make Me" (Bimbo Jones Club Mix) - 6:46\u000a"Make Me" (Ralphi Rosario Vocal Club Mix) - 9:20\u000a"Make Me" (Ralphi's Martini Mix) - 7:44\u000a"Make Me" (Craig J's Get It Up!

Arabic Iraq corresponded with ancient Babylonia (now Iraq) and Persian Iraq corresponded with ancient Media (now western Iran).

aV"Sun Arise" is the fourth single released by the Australian singer-songwriter Rolf Harris. Released in January 1961 in Australia and October 1962 in the UK, it was Harris' third charting hit in Australia (following "The Big Black Hat" in 1960) and second in the UK (following "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport" also 1960). Unlike his early chart hits, "Sun Arise" was not a comedy record, but came within the genre of world music with its didgeridoo-inspired sound.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production and lyrics ==\u000aThe song was written with fellow Western Australian Harry Butler, a naturalist later known for his television show In the Wild.\u000aAfter the success of "Tie Me Kangaroo Down", Harris assumed that his future records would be automatically released in the United Kingdom by his label EMI Records. EMI, however, were not so sure and directed him to George Martin, then known for producing some of the more off-the-wall records of the time. Martin initially called the recording "very boring", which Harris countered by saying that the Aborigines, who he was trying to imitate, would "repeat a phrase over and over again and it would become mesmerising". The song was re-written with slightly more lyrics and recorded using eight double basses to mimic the didgeridoo, which Harris could not play at the time. A notable feature of this song is the playing of claves.\u000aThe song's lyrical structure is simple with the vast majority of the lines starting simply "Sun Arise". The lyrics of the song came from a story Butler told him about Aboriginal beliefs. Some tribes see the sun as a goddess. Each time she wakes in the morning, her skirts of light gradually cover more and more of the land, bringing back warmth and light to the air. The only explicit reference to anything Australian in the song is the mention of the Kangaroo Paw flower, which is endemic to Western Australia.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Chart performance ==\u000aThe track was Harris' second top ten hit in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at no. 3. It was also his first hit in the United States, at no. 61 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also reached no. 61 in his native Australia and no. 98 on re-release in 1963. Thirty-five years after originally charting in the UK, the song (albeit in a re-recorded version) re-entered the chart in October 1997, reaching no. 26.\u000a"Sun Arise" was included on the album of the same name in 1963.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cover versions ==\u000aThe song was covered by Alice Cooper on their third album, Love it to Death.\u000aRobert Plant and Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin performed the song live on the Denton television show in 1994, as part of Page & Plant's No Quarter tour.\u000aThe Godfathers covered the song as one of their first singles, which was later compiled onto Hit by Hit.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aLyrics of this song at MetroLyrics (Alice Cooper cover)

aVLent (Latin: Quadragesima: Fortieth) is a solemn religious observance in the Christian liturgical calendar that begins on Ash Wednesday and ends approximately six weeks later, before Easter Sunday. The purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer for Easter through prayer, doing penance, mortifying the flesh, repentance of sins, almsgiving, and self-denial. This event is observed in the Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran, Methodist, and Catholic Churches. Some Anabaptist and evangelical churches also observe the Lenten season. Its institutional purpose is heightened in the annual commemoration of Holy Week, marking the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus, which recalls the tradition and events of the New Testament beginning on Palm Sunday, further climaxing on Jesus' crucifixion on Good Friday, which ultimately culminates in the joyful celebration on Easter Sunday of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.\u000aIn Lent, many Christians commit to fasting, as well as giving up certain luxuries in order to replicate the sacrifice of Jesus Christ's journey into the desert for 40 days. Many Christians also add a Lenten spiritual discipline, such as reading a daily devotional or praying through a Lenten calendar, to draw themselves near to God. The Stations of the Cross, a devotional commemoration of Christ's carrying the Cross and of his execution, are often observed. Many Roman Catholic and some Protestant churches remove flowers from their altars, while crucifixes, religious statues, and other elaborate religious symbols are often veiled in violet fabrics in solemn observance of the event. Throughout Christendom, some adherents mark the season with the traditional abstention from the consumption of meat, most notably among Roman Catholics.\u000aLent is traditionally described as lasting for 40 days, in commemoration of the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert, according to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, before beginning his public ministry, during which he endured temptation by Satan.\u000aHoly Week and the season of Lent, depending on denomination and local custom, end with Easter Vigil at sundown on Holy Saturday, on the morning of Easter Sunday, or at the midnight between them.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Etymology ==\u000a\u000aThe English word Lent is a shortened form of the Old English word len(c)ten, meaning "spring season", as its Dutch language cognate lente (Old Dutch lentin) still does today. A dated term in German, lenz (Old High German lenzo), is also related. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, 'the shorter form (? Old Germanic type *la\u014bgito- , *la\u014bgiton-) seems to be a derivative of *la\u014bgo- long ... and may possibly have reference to the lengthening of the days as characterizing the season of spring'. The origin of the -en element is less clear: it may simply be a suffix, or lencten may originally have been a compound of *la\u014bgo- 'long' and an otherwise little attested word *-tino, meaning 'day'.\u000aIn languages spoken where Christianity was earlier established, such as Greek and Latin, the term signifies the period dating from the 40th day before Easter. In modern Greek the term is \u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae, derived from the earlier \u03a4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae, meaning "fortieth". The corresponding word in Latin, quadragesima ("fortieth"), is the origin of the term used in Latin-derived languages and in some others: for example, Croatian korizma, French carême, Irish carghas, Italian quaresima, Portuguese quaresma, Albanian kreshma, Romanian p\u0103resimi, Spanish cuaresma, Basque garizuma and Welsh c(a)rawys.\u000aIn other languages, the name used refers to the activity associated with the season. Thus it is called "fasting period" in Czech (postní doba), German (Fastenzeit), and Norwegian (fasten/fastetid), and it is called "great fast" in Polish (wielki post) and Russian (\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u2013 veliki post).\u000aThe terms used in Filipino are kuwaresma (from the Spanish) and Mahál na Araw ("precious/great days"); the latter term is also used specifically for Holy Week.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Duration and traditions ==\u000aVarious Christian denominations calculate the 40 days of Lent differently. The way they observe Lent also differs.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Roman Catholicism ===\u000aIn the Roman Rite, the definition of Lent varies according to different documents. Lent ends on either Holy Thursday or Good Friday. While the official document on the Lenten season, Paschales Solemnitatis, says that "the first Sunday of Lent marks the beginning of the annual Lenten observance", the Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar says, "The forty days of Lent run from Ash Wednesday up to but excluding the Mass of the Lord's Supper exclusive." The first source represents a period of 40 days and the second a period of 44 days, because both sources agree that the end of Lent comes the evening of Holy Thursday, before the Mass of the Lord's Supper. Though some sources try to reconcile this with the phrase "40 days" by excluding Sundays and extending Lent through Holy Saturday no official documents support this interpretation.\u000aIn the Ambrosian Rite, Lent begins on the Sunday that follows what is celebrated as Ash Wednesday in the rest of the Latin Catholic Church, and ends as in the Roman Rite, thus being of 40 days, counting the Sundays but not Holy Thursday. The day for beginning the Lenten fast is the following Monday, the first weekday in Lent. The special Ash Wednesday fast is transferred to the first Friday of the Ambrosian Lent. Until this rite was revised by Saint Charles Borromeo the liturgy of the First Sunday of Lent was festive, celebrated in white vestments with chanting of the Gloria in Excelsis and Alleluia, in line with the recommendation in Matthew 6:16, "When you fast, do not look gloomy".\u000aThe period of Lent observed in the Eastern Catholic Churches corresponds to that in other churches of Eastern Christianity that have similar traditions.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Eastern Orthodoxy and Byzantine Rite ===\u000a\u000aIn the Byzantine Rite, i.e., the Eastern Orthodox Great Lent (Greek: \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae or \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u039d\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1, meaning "Great 40 Days" and "Great Fast" respectively) is the most important fasting season in the church year.\u000aThe 40 days of Great Lent includes Sundays, and begins on Clean Monday (two days earlier than Ash Wednesday) and are immediately followed by what are considered distinct periods of fasting, Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday, which in turn are followed straightway by Holy Week. Great Lent is broken only after the Paschal (Easter) Divine Liturgy.\u000aThe Eastern Orthodox Church maintains the traditional Church's teaching on fasting. The rules for lenten fasting are the monastic rules. Fasting in the Orthodox Church is more than simply abstaining from certain foods. During the Great Lent Orthodox Faithful intensify their prayers and spiritual exercises, go to church services more often, study the Scriptures and the works of the Church Fathers in depth, limit their entertainment and spendings and focus on charity and good works.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===\u000aAmong the Oriental Orthodox, there are various local traditions regarding Lent. Those using the Alexandrian Rite, i.e., the Coptic Orthodox, Coptic Catholic, Ethiopian Orthodox, Ethiopian Catholic, Eritrean Orthodox, and Eritrean Catholic Churches, observe eight weeks of Lent.\u000aIn Ethiopian Orthodoxy, fasting (tsome) lasts for 55 continuous days before Easter (Fasika), although the fast is divided into three separate periods: Tsome Hirkal, eight days commemorating an early Christian figure; Tsome Arba, 40 days of Lent; and Tsome Himamat, seven days commemorating Holy Week. Fasting involves abstention from animal products (meat, dairy, and eggs), and refraining from eating or drinking before 3:00 PM. Ethiopian devotees may also abstain from sexual activity and the consumption of alcohol.\u000aAs in the Eastern Orthodox Churches, the date of Easter is reckoned according to the Julian Calendar, and usually occurs later than Easter according to Gregorian Calendar used by Catholic and Protestant Churches.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Protestantism and Western Orthodoxy ===\u000aOne calculation has been that the season of Lent lasts from Ash Wednesday to Holy Saturday. This calculation makes Lent last 46 days, if the 6 Sundays are included, but only 40, if they are excluded, because there is no obligation to fast on the six Sundays in Lent. This definition is still that of the Anglican Church, Lutheran Church, Methodist Church, and Western Rite Orthodox Church.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other related fasting periods ==\u000a\u000aThe number 40 has many Biblical references:\u000aMoses spent 40 days on Mount Sinai with God (Exodus 24:18)\u000aElijah spent 40 days and nights walking to Mount Horeb (1 Kings 19:8)\u000aGod sent 40 days and nights of rain in the great flood of Noah (Genesis 7:4)\u000aThe Hebrew people wandered 40 years in the desert while traveling to the Promised Land (Numbers 14:33)\u000aJonah's prophecy of judgment gave 40 days to the city of Nineveh in which to repent or be destroyed (Jonah 3:4).\u000aJesus retreated into the wilderness, where He fasted for 40 days, and was tempted by the devil (Matthew 4:1\u20132, Mark 1:12\u201313, Luke 4:1\u20132). He overcame all three of Satan's temptations by citing scripture to the devil, at which point the devil left him, angels ministered to Jesus, and He began His ministry. Jesus further said that His disciples should fast "when the bridegroom shall be taken from them" (Matthew 9:15), a reference to his Passion.\u000aSince, presumably, the Apostles fasted as they mourned the death of Jesus, Christians have traditionally fasted during the annual commemoration of his burial.\u000aIt is the traditional belief that Jesus laid for 40 hours in the tomb, which led to the 40 hours of total fasting that preceded the Easter celebration in the early Church (the biblical reference to 'three days in the tomb' is understood by them as spanning three days, from Friday afternoon to early Sunday morning, rather than three 24-hour periods of time). Some Christian denominations, such as The Way International and Logos Apostolic Church of God, as well as Anglican scholar E. W. Bullinger in The Companion Bible, believe Christ was in the grave for a total of 72 hours, reflecting the type of Jonah in the belly of the whale.\u000aOne of the most important ceremonies at Easter is the baptism of the initiates on Easter Eve. The fast was initially undertaken by the catechumens to prepare them for the reception of this sacrament. Later, the period of fasting from Good Friday until Easter Day was extended to six days, to correspond with the six weeks of training necessary to give the final instruction to those converts who were to be baptized.\u000aConverts to Catholicism followed a strict catechumenate or period of instruction and discipline prior to baptism. In Jerusalem near the close of the fourth century, classes were held throughout Lent for three hours each day. With the legalization of Christianity (by the Edict of Milan) and its later imposition as the state religion of the Roman Empire, its character was endangered by the great influx of new members. In response, the Lenten fast and practices of self-renunciation were required annually of all Christians, both to show solidarity with the catechumens, and for their own spiritual benefit.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Associated customs ==\u000a\u000aThere are traditionally 40 days in Lent; these are marked by fasting, both from foods and festivities, and by other acts of penance. The three traditional practices to be taken up with renewed vigour during Lent are prayer (justice towards God), fasting (justice towards self), and almsgiving (justice towards neighbours).\u000aHowever, in modern times, observers give up partaking in vices and often invest the time or money saved in charitable purposes or organizations.\u000aIn addition, some believers add a regular spiritual discipline, to bring them closer to God, such as reading a Lenten daily devotional. Another practice commonly added is the singing of the Stabat Mater hymn in designated groups. Among Filipino Catholics, the recitation of Jesus Christ' passion, called Pasiong Mahal, is also observed. In some Christian countries, grand religious processions and cultural customs are observed, and the faithful attempt to visit seven churches during Holy Week in honor of Jesus Christ heading to Mount Calvary.\u000aIn many liturgical Christian denominations, Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday form the Easter Triduum. Lent is a season of grief that necessarily ends with a great celebration of Easter. Thus, it is known in Eastern Orthodox circles as the season of "Bright Sadness". It is a season of sorrowful reflection which is punctuated by breaks in the fast on Sundays.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Omission of Gloria and Alleluia ==\u000aThe Gloria in excelsis Deo, which is usually said or sung on Sundays at Mass of the Roman Rite and Anglican rite, is omitted on the Sundays of Lent, but continues in use on solemnities and feasts and on special celebrations of a more solemn kind. Some mass compositions were written especially for Lent, such as Michael Haydn's Missa tempore Quadragesimae, without Gloria, in D minor, and for modest forces, only choir and organ. The Gloria is used on Holy Thursday, to the accompaniment of bells, which then fall silent until the Gloria in excelsis of the Easter Vigil.\u000aThe Roman Rite associates the Alleluia with joy and omits it entirely throughout Lent, not only at Mass but also in the Liturgy of the Hours as well as outside the liturgy. Before 1970, the omission began with Septuagesima. The word "Alleluia" at the beginning and end of the Acclamation Before the Gospel at Mass is replaced by another phrase. Before 1970, the whole Acclamation was omitted and was replaced by a Tract. Again, before 1970, the word "Alleluia" normally added to the Gloria Patri at the beginning of each Hour of the Liturgy of the Hours was replaced by the phrase Laus tibi, Domine, rex aeternae gloriae (Praise to you, O Lord, king of eternal glory). Now it is simply omitted.\u000aUntil the Ambrosian Rite was revised by Saint Charles Borromeo the liturgy of the First Sunday of Lent was festive, celebrated with chanting of the Gloria and Alleluia, in line with the recommendation in Matthew 6:16, "When you fast, do not look gloomy".\u000aIn the Byzantine Rite, the Gloria (Great Doxology) continues to be used in its normal place in the Matins service, and the Alleluia appears all the more frequently, replacing "God is the Lord" at Matins.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Veiling of religious images ==\u000aIn certain pious Catholic countries, before the Second Vatican Council, religious objects were veiled for the entire 40 days of Lent. Though perhaps uncommon in the United States of America, this pious practice is consistently observed in Goa, India, Malta, Peru, the Philippines (the latter only for the entire duration of Holy Week, with the exception of processional images), and in the Spanish cities: Barcelona, Málaga, and Seville. In Ireland, before Vatican II, when impoverished rural Catholic convents and parishes could not afford purple fabrics, they resorted to either removing the statues altogether or, if too heavy or bothersome, turned the statues to face the wall. As is popular custom, the 14 Stations of the Cross plaques on the walls are not veiled.\u000a\u000aCrucifixes made before the time of Saint Francis of Assisi did not have a corpus (body of Christ) and therefore were adorned with jewels and gemstones, which was referred to as Crux Gemmatae. To keep the faithful from adoring the crucifixes elaborated with ornamentation, veiling it in royal purple fabrics came into place. The violet colour later evolved as a color of penance and mourning.\u000aFurther liturgical changes in modernity reduced such observances to the last week of Passiontide. In parishes that could afford only small quantities of violet fabrics, only the heads of the statues were veiled. If no violet fabrics could be afforded at all, then the religious statues and images were turned around facing the wall. Flowers were always removed as a sign of solemn mourning.\u000aIn pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite, the last two weeks of Lent are known as Passiontide, a period beginning on the Fifth Sunday in Lent, which in the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal is called the First Sunday in Passiontide and in earlier editions Passion Sunday. All statues (and in England paintings as well) in the church were traditionally veiled in violet. This was seen as in keeping with the Gospel of that Sunday (John 8:46\u201359), in which Jesus "hid himself" from the people.\u000a\u000aPerhaps, in part, due to a general decline in piety and ornate Catholic artwork, in general, within many churches in the United States of America, after the Second Vatican Council, the need to veil statues or crosses became increasingly irrelevant and was deemed unnecessary by some diocesan bishops. As a result, the veils were removed at the singing of the Gloria in Excelsis Deo during the Easter Vigil. In 1970, the name "Passiontide" was dropped, although the last two weeks are markedly different from the rest of the season, and continuance of the tradition of veiling images is left to the discretion of a country's conference of bishops or even to individual parishes as pastors may wish.\u000aOn Good Friday, the Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist churches used to veil "all pictures, statutes, and the cross are covered in mourning black", while "the chancel and altar coverings are replaced with black, and altar candles are extinguished". The fabrics are then "replaced with white on sunrise on Easter Sunday". However, most Anglican churches now use purple fabric to cover the cross, etc.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Pre-Lenten festivals ==\u000a\u000aThe carnival celebrations which in many cultures traditionally precede Lent are seen as a last opportunity for excess before Lent begins. Some of the most famous are the Carnival of Barranquilla, the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the Carnival of Venice, Cologne Carnival, the New Orleans Mardi Gras, the Rio de Janeiro carnival, and the Trinidad and Tobago Carnival.\u000aThe day immediately preceding Lent is variously called Mardi Gras ("Fat Tuesday"), Pancake Tuesday, or Shrove Tuesday. Sometimes, it is the peak of the pre-Lenten festival, while sometimes it is largely occupied with preparations for Lent. The observances vary from culture to culture, and even from town to town.\u000aOriginally, in Lebanon and Syria, the last Thursday preceding Lent was called "Khamis el zakara". For Catholics, it was meant to be a day of remembrance of the dead ones. However, zakara (which means "remembrance", in Arabic) was gradually replaced by sakara (meaning "getting drunk" in Arabic), and so the occasion came to be known as Khamis el sakara, wherein celebrants indulge themselves with alcoholic beverages.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Fasting and abstinence ==\u000aFasting during Lent was more prominent in ancient times than today. Socrates Scholasticus reports that in some places, all animal products were strictly forbidden, while various others permitted fish, or fish and fowl, others prohibited fruit and eggs, and still others permitted only bread. In some places, the observant abstained from food for a whole day until the mid-afternoon or evening.\u000aFor Latin Catholics, by the early 20th century the theoretical obligation of the penitential fast throughout Lent except on Sundays was to take only one full meal a day and that around noon. In addition, a smaller meal, called a collation, was allowed in the evening, and a cup of some beverage, accompanied by a little bread, in the morning. In practice, this obligation, which was a matter of custom rather than of written law, was not observed strictly.\u000aThe 1917 Code of Canon Law allowed the full meal on a fasting day to be taken at any hour and to be supplemented by two collations, with the quantity and the quality of the food to be determined by local custom. The Lenten fast ended on Holy Saturday at noon. Only those aged 21 to 59 were obliged to fast. As with all merely ecclesiastical laws, particular difficulties, such as strenuous work or illness, excused one from observance, and a dispensation from the law could be granted by a bishop or parish priest. In addition to fasting, abstinence from meat was to be observed on Ash Wednesday and on Fridays and Saturdays in Lent.\u000aA rule of thumb is that the two collations should not add up to the equivalent of another full meal. Rather portions were to be: "sufficient to sustain strength, but not sufficient to satisfy hunger".\u000aThe apostolic constitution Paenitemini of 17 February 1966 reduced the fasting days to two: Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, and allowed episcopal conferences to "substitute abstinence and fast wholly or in part with other forms of penitence and especially works of charity and the exercises of piety". This was made part of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, which made obligatory fasting for those aged between 18 and 59, and abstinence for those aged 14 and upward.\u000aThe Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference decided to allow other forms of Friday penance to replace that of abstinence from meat, whether in Lent or outside Lent, suggesting alternatives such as abstaining from some other food, or from alcohol or smoking; making a special effort at participating in family prayer or in Mass; making the Stations of the Cross; or helping the poor, sick, old, or lonely. The Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales made a similar ruling in 1985 but decided in 2011 to restore the traditional year-round Friday abstinence from meat. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has maintained the rule of abstention from meat on Friday only during Lent.\u000aDuring the early Middle Ages, eggs, dairy products, and meat were generally forbidden. In favour of the traditional practice, observed both in East and West, Thomas Aquinas argued that "they afford greater pleasure as food [than fish], and greater nourishment to the human body, so that from their consumption there results a greater surplus available for seminal matter, which when abundant becomes a great incentive to lust." Aquinas also authorized the consumption of candy during Lent, because "sugared spices" (such as comfits) were, in his opinion, digestive aids on par with medicine rather than food.\u000a\u000aIn Spain, the bull of the Holy Crusade (renewed periodically after 1492) allowed the consumption of dairy products and eggs during Lent in exchange for a contribution to the cause of the crusade.\u000aGiraldus Cambrensis, in his Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwin through Wales, reports that "in Germany and the arctic regions", "great and religious persons" eat the tail of beavers as "fish" because of its superficial resemblance to "both the taste and colour of fish". The animal was very abundant in Wales at the time.\u000aIn current Western societies the practice is considerably relaxed, though in the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic Churches, abstinence from all animal products including eggs, fish, fowl, and milk sourced from animals (e.g., cows and goats, as opposed to the milk of coconuts and soy beans) is still commonly practiced, so that, where this is observed, only vegetarian (or vegan) meals are consumed for the whole of Lent, 45 days in the Byzantine Rite.\u000aIn the Western Catholic Church, the obligation to fast no longer applies to all weekdays of Lent (40 days), but only to Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. In the tradition of this part of the Catholic Church, abstinence from eating some form of food (generally meat, but not dairy or fish products) is distinguished from fasting. Fasting involves having during the day only one proper meal with up to two "collations", light meatless meals sufficient to maintain strength but not adding up to the equivalent of a full meal. In principle, abstinence is to be observed on Ash Wednesday and on every Friday of the year that is not a solemnity (a liturgical feast day of the highest rank); but in each country the episcopal conference can determine the form it is to take, perhaps replacing abstinence with other forms of penance.\u000aPresent canonical legislation on these matters follows the 1966 Apostolic Constitution of Pope Paul VI, Paenitemini, in which he recommended that fasting be appropriate to the local economic situation and that all Catholics voluntarily fast and abstain. He also allowed replacing fasting and abstinence with prayer and works of charity in countries with a lower standard of living. The law of abstinence binds those age 14 or over, and that of fast binds those who are at least 18 years of age and not yet 60. The sick and those who have special needs are excused, and dispensations can be granted by episcopal conferences or individual bishops, which can be wider outside of Lent. Even during Lent, the rule about solemnities holds, so that the obligation of Friday abstinence does not apply on 19 and 25 March when, as usually happens, the solemnities of Saint Joseph and the Annunciation are celebrated on those dates. The same applies to Saint Patrick's Day, which is a solemnity in the whole of Ireland as well as in dioceses that have Saint Patrick as principal patron saint. In some other places, too, where there are strong Irish traditions within the Catholic community, a dispensation is granted for that day. In Hong Kong, where Ash Wednesday often coincides with Chinese New Year celebrations, a dispensation is then granted from the laws of fast and abstinence, and the faithful are exhorted to use some other form of penance.\u000aAfter the Protestant Reformation, in the Lutheran Church, "Church orders of the 16th century retained the observation of the Lenten fast, and Lutherans have observed this season with a serene, earnest attitude." In the Anglican Church, Saint Augustine's Prayer Book, a companion to the Book of Common Prayer, states that fasting is "usually meaning not more than a light breakfast, one full meal, and one half meal, on the forty days of Lent". It further states that "the major Fast Days of Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, as the American Prayer-Book indicates, are stricter in obligation, though not in observance, than the other Fast Days, and therefore should not be neglected except in cases of serious illness or other necessity of an absolute character."\u000a\u000aTraditionally, on Sunday, and during the hours before sunrise and after sunset, some Churches, such as Episcopalians, allow "breaks" in their Lent promises. For Roman Catholics, the Lenten penitential season ends after the Easter Vigil Mass. Orthodox Christians also break their fast after the Paschal Vigil, a service which starts around 11:00 pm on Holy Saturday, and which includes the Paschal celebration of the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom. At the end of the service, the priest blesses cheese, eggs, flesh meats, and other items that the faithful have been abstaining from for the duration of Great Lent.\u000aLenten traditions and liturgical practices are less common, less binding, and sometimes non-existent among some liberal and progressive Christians, since these generally do not emphasize piety and the mortification of the flesh as a significant virtue. A greater emphasis on anticipation of Easter Sunday is often encouraged more than the penitence of Lent or Holy Week.\u000aSome Christians as well as secular groups also interpret the Lenten fast in a positive tone, not as renunciation but as contributing to causes such as environmental stewardship and improvement of health. Even some atheists find value in the Christian tradition and observe Lent.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Media coverage ==\u000aDuring Lent, BBC's Radio Four normally broadcasts a series of programmes called the Lent Talks. These 15-minute programmes are normally broadcast on a Wednesday and have featured various speakers.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Holy days within the season of Lent ==\u000a\u000aThere are several holy days within the season of Lent:\u000aAsh Wednesday is the first day of Lent in the Roman Rite and in the traditions of most mainline Reformed and Protestant traditions.\u000aIn the Ambrosian Rite and the Mozarabic Rite, there is no Ash Wednesday: Lent begins on the first Sunday and the fast begins on the first Monday.\u000aThe Sundays in Lent carry Latin names in German Lutheranism, derived from the beginning of the Sunday's introit. The first is called Invocabit, the second Reminiscere, the third Oculi, the fourth Laetare, the fifth Judica, the sixth Palm Sunday.\u000aThe fourth Sunday in Lent, which marks the halfway point between Ash Wednesday and Easter Sunday, is referred to as Laetare Sunday by Anglicans, Roman Catholics, and many other Christians, because of the traditional Entrance Antiphon of the Mass. Due to the more "joyful" character of the day (since laetare in Latin means "rejoice"), the priest, deacon, and subdeacon have the option of wearing vestments of a rose colour (pink) instead of violet.\u000aAdditionally, the fourth Lenten Sunday, Mothering Sunday, which has become known as Mother's Day in the United Kingdom and an occasion for honouring mothers of children, has its origin in a 16th-century celebration of the Mother Church.\u000aThe fifth Sunday in Lent, also known in some denominations as Passion Sunday (and in some denominations also applies to Palm Sunday) marks the beginning of Passiontide.\u000aThe sixth Sunday in Lent, commonly called Palm Sunday, marks the beginning of Holy Week, the final week of Lent immediately preceding Easter.\u000aWednesday of Holy Week, Holy Wednesday (also sometimes known as Spy Wednesday) commemorates Judas Iscariot's bargain to betray Jesus.\u000aThursday of Holy Week is known as Maundy Thursday or Holy Thursday, and is a day Christians commemorate the Last Supper shared by Christ with his disciples.\u000aThe next day is Good Friday, on which Christians remember Jesus' crucifixion, death, and burial.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Easter Triduum ===\u000aIn the Anglican, Lutheran, Old Catholic, Roman Catholic, and many other churches, the Easter Triduum is a three-day event that begins Maundy Thursday evening, with the entrance hymn of the Mass of the Lord's Supper. After this celebration, the consecrated Hosts are taken solemnly from the altar to a place of reposition, where the faithful are invited to meditate in the presence of the consecrated Hosts.This is the Church's response to Jesus' question to the disciples sleeping in the Garden of Gethsemane, "Could you not watch with me one hour?" On the next day, the liturgical commemoration of the Passion of Jesus Christ is celebrated at 3 pm, unless a later time is chosen due to work schedules.\u000aThis service consists of readings from the Scriptures, especially John the Evangelist's account of the Passion of Jesus, followed by prayers, veneration of the cross of Jesus, and a communion service at which the hosts consecrated at the evening Mass of the day before are distributed. The Easter Vigil during the night between Holy Saturday afternoon and Easter Sunday morning starts with the blessing of a fire and a special candle, and with readings from Scripture associated with baptism. Then, the Gloria in Excelsis Deo is sung, water is blessed, baptism and confirmation of adults may take place, the people are invited to renew the promises of their own baptism, and finally, Mass is celebrated in the usual way from the Preparation of the Gifts onwards.\u000aHoly Week and the season of Lent, depending on denomination and local custom, end with Easter Vigil at sundown on Holy Saturday or on the morning of Easter Sunday. It is custom for some churches to hold sunrise services which include open air celebrations in some places.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Vestments ==\u000aIn the Lutheran, Roman Catholic, and many Anglican churches, the priest's vestments are violet during the season of Lent. On the fourth Sunday in Lent, rose-coloured (pink) vestments may be worn in lieu of violet. Historically, black had also been used: Pope Innocent III declared black to be the proper color for Lent, though Durandus of Saint-Pourçain claims violet has preference over black.\u000aIn some Anglican churches, a type of unbleached linen or muslin known as "Lenten array" is worn during the first three weeks of Lent, crimson is worn during Passiontide, and on holy days, the colour proper to the day is worn.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aFasting in the Eastern Orthodox Church\u000aFasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church\u000aFasting and abstinence of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria\u000aFast of Nineveh\u000aPeople's Sunday\u000aQuinquagesima\u000aModern interpretations\u000aLent Event, asks people to donate the value of what they forego during Lent\u000aNon-Christian:\u000aCold Food Festival\u000aCounting of the Omer\u000aRamadan\u000aTisha B'Av\u000aVassa\u000aYom Kippur\u000aGeneral:\u000aAsceticism\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aThe Lenten Season and How To Observe Lent\u000aDaily Lenten Devotional \u2013 LHM\u000aMethodist Church: Lent and Easter Resources

aVThe Chicago Pride Parade, also colloquially (and formerly) called the Chicago Gay Pride Parade or PRIDE Chicago, is the annual pride parade held on the last Sunday of June in Chicago, Illinois in the United States. It is considered the culmination of the larger Gay and Lesbian Pride Month, as promulgated by the Chicago City Council and Mayor of Chicago. Chicago's Pride Parade is one of the largest, by attendance, in the world.\u000aThe first parade was organized on Saturday, June 27, 1970, as a march from Washington Square Park ("Bughouse Square") to the Water Tower at the intersection of Michigan and Chicago avenues, which was the route originally planned, and then many of the participants extemporaneously marched on to the Civic Center (now Richard J. Daley) Plaza. Today the parade takes place through the main streets of Lake View East, a neighborhood enclave of the Lakeview community area. Recent parades have started at noon on Halsted Street, proceeding north from Belmont Avenue, passing the Center on Halsted at Waveland Avenue; south on Broadway (at Grace Street) to Diversey Parkway and east on Diversey Parkway to Cannon Drive. The parade route will begin in the Uptown neighborhood at the corner of Broadway and Montrose. The parade will then proceed south down Broadway to Halsted, continue south on Halsted to Belmont, then east on Belmont to Broadway where it will resume its former route.\u000aWith the increasing political participation of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans and the community's relatively high financial resources through political action groups and as individual donors, Illinois politicians have increased their presence at the Chicago Pride Parade. Both the Illinois Democratic and Republican parties have been heavily represented, most noticeably by former Governor Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat, and former Treasurer Judy Baar Topinka, a Republican. Both had strong support from many gay and lesbian voters.\u000aOn June 28, 2009 more than 500,000 spectators watched the 40th annual Chicago Pride Parade. Among the entries were several marching bands, dance troupes, twirlers, and many political figures. The 2010 parade featured an appearance from the Chicago Blackhawks' Brent Sopel and The Stanley Cup as part of the Chicago Gay Hockey Association's float. Sopel appeared in the parade to honor Brendan Burke, the gay son of the Maple Leafs' GM Brian Burke. The 2011 parade included 250 entries and was attended by over 800,000 spectators, almost double the previous year, causing massive overcrowding and resulted in a reorganization of the parade route for the 2012 parade.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Annual parade details ==\u000aJune 28, 1970: (1st) Attendance: 150-200 Parade Route: Bughouse Square, down Dearborn to Chicago Avenue, east to the Water Tower, then south on Michigan Avenue to the Civic Center (now Daley Plaza)[1]\u000aJune 27, 1971: (2nd) Attendance: 1000 Parade Route: Diversey Harbor, going west to Clark Street, then south to the Free Forum at LaSalle Street [2]\u000aJune 25, 1972: (3rd) Attendance:\u000aJune 24, 1973: (4th) Attendance:\u000aJune 30, 1974: (5th) Attendance:\u000aJune 29, 1975: (6th) Attendance:\u000aJune 27, 1976: (7th) Attendance:\u000aJune 26, 1977: (8th) Attendance: 3000 Parade Route: Halsted and Addison, going east to Broadway, south to Clark, then south on Clark to Fullerton, east on Fullerton to Stockton Drive, and finally south on Stockton to the Lincoln Park Free Foru [3]\u000aJune 25, 1978: (9th) Attendance:\u000aJune 24, 1979: (10th) Attendance:\u000aJune 29, 1980: (11th) Attendance:\u000aJune 28, 1981: (12th) Attendance:\u000aJune 27, 1982: (13th) Attendance: 30,000 [4]\u000aJune 26, 1983: (14th) Attendance:\u000aJune 24, 1984: (15th) Attendance:\u000aJune 30, 1985: (16th) Attendance: 35,000\u000aJune 29, 1986: (17th) Attendance: 40,000\u000aJune 28, 1987: (18th) Attendance:\u000aJune 26, 1988: (19th) Attendance:\u000aJune 25, 1989: (20th) Grand Marshal: Mayor Daley (first sitting Chicago Mayor to lead the Chicago parade) Attendance:\u000aJune 24, 1990: (21st) Attendance: 100,000 [5]\u000aJune 30, 1991: (22nd) Attendance: 100,000+\u000aJune 28, 1992: (23rd) Attendance: 115,000\u000aJune 27, 1993: (24th) Attendance: 140,000\u000aJune 5, 1994: (25th) Attendance: 160,000 [6]\u000aJune 25, 1995: (26th) Attendance: 175,000\u000aJune 30, 1996: (27th) Attendance: 150,000\u000aJune 29, 1997: (28th) Attendance: 200,000\u000aJune 28, 1998: (29th) Attendance: 200,000+\u000aJune 27, 1999: (30th) Attendance: 250,000\u000aJune 25, 2000: (31st) Attendance: 350,000\u000aJune 24, 2001: (32nd) Attendance: 350,000\u000aJune 30, 2002: (33rd) Attendance: 350,000\u000aJune 29, 2003: (34th) Grand Marshal Billy Bean; Attendance: 375,000 [7]\u000aJune 27, 2004: (35th) Grand Marshal Esera Tuaolo; Attendance: 375,000 [8]\u000aJune 26, 2005: (36th) Grand Marshal Wilson Cruz; Attendance: 450,000 [9]\u000aJune 25, 2006: (37th) Grand Marshal George Takei; Attendance: 400,000 [10]\u000aJune 24, 2007: (38th) Grand Marshal John Amaechi; Attendance: 450,000 [11]\u000aJune 29, 2008: (39th) "Live, Love, Be Proud"; Grand Marshal Eric Alva Attendance: 450,000 [12];\u000aJune 28, 2009: (40th) "Stonewall: 40 Years After"; Grand Marshal Alexandra Billings; Attendance: 500,000\u000aJune 27, 2010: (41st) "One heart, One world, one pride"; Grand Marshal Chely Wright; Attendance: 450,000 [13] [14]\u000aJune 26, 2011: (42nd) Grand Marshal Fernanda Rocha; Attendance: 750,000 [15]\u000aJune 24, 2012: (43rd) Grand Marshal Evan Wolfson of Freedom to Marry; Attendance: 850,000 [16]\u000aJune 30, 2013, (44th) Grand Marshal Wade Davis; Attendance: 1,000,000 [17]; Noon \u2013 4:00 pm: [18];\u000aJune 29, 2014, (45th) Grand Marshal Will Sheridan; Attendance 1,000,000+ [19]\u000aJune 28, 2015, (46th) Grand Marshal Ty Herndon; Attendance 1,000,000+ [20]\u000aJune 26, 2016, (47th) Grand Marshal Monica Raymund; Attendance 1,000,000+ [21]\u000aJune 25, 2017, (48th) Grand Marshal Lea Delaria; Attendance 1,000,000+ [22]\u000aAs the Chicago Pride Parade is held on the last Sunday in June (except for in 1994), weather for the event is usually warm and dry.

aVThe Hiller VZ-1 Pawnee (U.S. Army designation; earlier Army designation: HO-1) was a unique direct-lift rotor aircraft, using contra-rotating ducted fans for lift inside a platform upon which the single pilot shifted body weight for directional control. The platform was developed starting in 1953 under an Office of Naval Research (ONR) contract to Hiller Aircraft, and flew successfully beginning in 1955.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Design and development ==\u000aThe original concept had been developed by Charles H. Zimmerman in the late 1940s. Further development followed, both by Hiller Aircraft and the De Lackner Company. There were two main models, the ONR model 1031-A-1, and the somewhat larger VZ-1 Pawnee model produced in 1956 for the U.S. Army. Three of each model were built as prototypes. Neither of the variants was put into production.\u000aThe smaller ONR model used two 44 horsepower (33 kW) Nelson H-59 piston engines, coupled to the propellers by a modified helicopter transmission built by the Industrial Power Division of Hall-Scott. The larger Pawnee model used three of the aforementioned engine and had an extended duct area. The Pawnee had ineffective "kinesthetic control" and instead had the operator seated on a platform controlling the flight with conventional helicopter controls.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Testing and evaluation ==\u000aDue to aerodynamic effects in the duct within which the propellers rotated, the platform was dynamically stable, even though the pilot and center of gravity of the platform were fairly high up. In testing, the prototypes flew well, but the U.S. Army judged them to be impractical as combat vehicles as they were small, limited in speed and only barely flew out of the ground cushion effect.\u000aTwo of the six prototypes are known to survive; both are ONR 1031-A-1 models. One is located at the Hiller Aviation Museum in San Carlos, California, the other is at the National Air and Space Museum's Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia. The latter platform was formerly on loan to the Pima Air & Space Museum. A replica of the 1031 platform is on display at the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Gallery ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Specifications (Model 1031-A-1) ==\u000aData from National Air and Space Museum and Hall-Scott Motor Company\u000aGeneral characteristics\u000aCrew: one\u000aPayload: 185 lb (84 kg)\u000aLength: 8 ft 4 in diameter (2.54 m)\u000aRotor diameter: 7 ft (2.13 m)\u000aHeight: 7 ft (2.13 m)\u000aEmpty weight: 370 lb (167.8 kg)\u000aMax. takeoff weight: 555 lb (251.7 kg)\u000aPowerplant: × 2 × Nelson H-56 piston engines, 40 hp (30 kW) each\u000aPropellers: 2 × contra-rotating two-bladed aluminum\u000aTransmission: Hall-Scott helicopter variant\u000aPerformance\u000aMaximum speed: 16 mph (26 km/h)\u000aService ceiling: 32.8 ft (10 m)\u000aArmament\u000aStandard combat weapons of a U.S. soldier\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aWilliams X-Jet\u000aAircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\u000aBensen B-10\u000aDe Lackner HZ-1 Aerocycle\u000aRelated lists\u000aList of military aircraft of the United States\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aNotes\u000a\u000aBibliography\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aFlying Platform article at the Hiller Aviation Museum

aVHumulus, hop, is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Cannabaceae. The hop is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Hops are the female flowers (seed cones, strobiles) of the hop species H. lupulus; as a main flavor ingredient in beer, H. lupulus is widely cultivated for use by the brewing industry.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description ==\u000aAlthough frequently referred to as the hops "vine", it is technically a bine; unlike vines, which use tendrils, suckers, and other appendages for attaching themselves, bines have stout stems with stiff hairs to aid in climbing. It is a perennial herbaceous plant which sends up new shoots in early spring and dies back to the cold-hardy rhizome in autumn. Hop shoots grow very rapidly, and at the peak of growth can grow 20 to 50 centimetres (8 to 20 in) per week. Hop bines climb by wrapping clockwise (except for Humulus japonicus) around anything within reach, and individual bines typically grow between 2 to 15 metres (7 to 50 ft) depending on what is available to grow on. The leaves are opposite, with a 7 to 12 cm (2.8 to 4.7 in) leafstalk and a heart-shaped, fan-lobed blade 12 to 25 cm (4.7 to 9.8 in) long and broad; the edges are coarsely toothed. When the hop bines run out of material to climb, horizontal shoots sprout between the leaves of the main stem to form a network of stems wound round each other.\u000aMale and female flowers of the hop plant develop on separate plants (dioecious). Female plants, which produce the hop flowers used in brewing beer, are often propagated vegetatively and grown in the absence of male plants. This prevents pollination and the development of viable seeds, which are sometimes considered undesirable for brewing beer owing to the potential for off-flavors arising from the introduction of fatty acids from the seeds.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Species ==\u000a\u000aThere are three species, one with five varieties:\u000aHumulus japonicus (syn. H. scandens). Asian hop. Leaves with 5\u20137 lobes. Eastern Asia.\u000aHumulus yunnanensis Asian hop from Yunnan, China.\u000aHumulus lupulus. Common hop. Leaves with 3\u20135 lobes. Europe, western Asia, North America.Humulus lupulus var. lupulus. Europe, western Asia.\u000aHumulus lupulus var. cordifolius. Eastern Asia.\u000aHumulus lupulus var. lupuloides (syn. H. americanus). Eastern North America.\u000aHumulus lupulus var. neomexicanus. Western North America.\u000aHumulus lupulus var. pubescens. Midwest and eastern North America.\u000a\u000aBrewers' hops are specific cultivars, propagated by asexual reproduction, see the article, "List of hop varieties".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Hops applications ==\u000aHops are boiled with the wort in brewing beer and sometimes added post-ferment; they impart a bitterness, flavor, as well as aroma to the finished product.\u000aIn pharmacy lupulus is the designation of hop. The dried catkins, commonly referred to as hop cones, of the female plant of H. lupulus are used to prepare infusion of hop, tincture of hop, and extract of hop.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Hops chemistry and pharmacology ==\u000aThe characteristic bitterness imparted by the addition of hops to the brewing process is mainly due to the presence of the bitter acids, which are prenylated acylphloroglucinol derivatives. Bitter acids are divided into the alpha-acids, with humulone the major compound, and the beta-acids, with lupulone the major compound;} the alpha-acids isomerize during the brewing process to form iso-alpha acids, which themselves have a bitter taste. These hop acids are vinylogous acids, with acidic ring enols in conjugation with ring and substituent carbonyl groups.\u000aPlants in the genus Humulus produce terpenophenolic metabolites. Hops also contain xanthohumol, a prenylated chalcone, and other compounds under preliminary research for their potential health properties.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aJeanine S.

aVAnnesley Old Church or the Church of All Saints, Annesley Park, is a disused church in a ruinous condition which stands on a mound near to Annesley Hall, Nottinghamshire. The building remains are Grade I listed and are surrounded by a graveyard. The site is scheduled as an ancient monument.\u000aThe church is built in stone and measures approximately 35 m by 14.5 m. The standing remains include the roofless west tower, nave, chancel and a large 14th-century lady chapel to the south. The Lady Chapel, known as the "Felley Chantry\u201d after the priory at Felley to whom the patronage once belonged, contained three fine sedilia and a piscina and a large east window with reticulated stone tracery. The surrounding graveyard contains a variety of mainly 17th- and 18th-century grave markers.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe present building, constructed by the Annesley family in 1356, replaced a previous Norman building on the same site. After the Annesley estate had passed by marriage to the Chaworths, Patrick Chaworth, 3rd Viscount Chaworth, in 1686 built the flight of steps leading up to the church and arranged for a carving of his coat of arms, or Achievement, to be fixed one of the tower walls in the church. As the village of Annesley developed into a mining community it was decided to build a new church on a site nearer to the growing colliery community. The new church, All Saints' Church, Annesley, was consecrated in 1874. Occasional services, especially Harvest Festivals, continued to be held in the old church until 1942. Following the cessation of use the building deteriorated and Viscount Chaworth's achievement was transferred to the new church. When the Annesley estate was sold in 1973 the buildings fell into a state of total disrepair and were sold by the Church Commissioners to Ashfield District Council for a nominal £1. In 2012 Ashfield District Council completed a programme of preservation and restoration to make the site safe and accessible to visitors.\u000aThe ruined building was Grade I listed in 1966 and scheduled as an Ancient Monument in 1977. It is also on the Heritage at Risk register. In 2011 it was announced that the Heritage Lottery Fund would make an award of £450,000 to help Ashfield District Council to fund its conservation. The project will conserve what remains of the church buildings and make the site more accessible for visitors. The Annesley Old Church Project Facebook Community was created by supporters of the Annesley Old Church Project. This three-year project includes phases that seek to restore the ruins and promote the use of the site for community events and activities. Planned events include heritage walks, nature surveys, creative writing workshops, arts events, and activities that promote research on the history of the church and the surrounding district.\u000aThe church is mentioned in the writings of both Lord Byron and D H Lawrence.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a"Annesley Old Church".

aVShama Sikander Gesawat (born 4 August 1979) is an Indian actress who is best remembered for her lead role in the TV series Yeh Meri Life Hai (2003-2005). She has acted in television serials and is also known as a TV program host and a reality show contestant. On the big screen, she has appeared in a few Bollywood movies, including the Aamir Khan starrer Mann in 1999.\u000aSikander is also active as a fashion model, and she launched her own design company, Saisha, in 2010.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aShama Sikander Gesawat was born in Makrana, Rajasthan, India, and is the daughter of Gulshan, a housewife and Sikander Gesawat who was a marble supplier and now practices ayurveda. At the age of 10 her family moved to Mumbai, Maharashtra, where she lived together with her younger siblings, Khalid, Rizwan, and Salma (born 1991). Sikander has mentioned in interviews that her early years in Mumbai were extremely difficult, even commenting that at times "there was no food in the house to feed the family".\u000aHaving moved locations frequently, Sikander attended as many as nine schools in her early life in Makrana and in various parts of Greater Mumbai including Malad, Mumbra, Thane, and Andheri. Following her completion of the 10th grade, and passing the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education examination, Sikander enrolled in the Roshan Taneja School of Acting in Mumbai in 1995, graduating from the course a year later.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aSikander began her career on the big screen with small parts in Prem Aggan (1998 Hindi) and Mann (1999 Hindi) before landing a supporting role in Ansh: The Deadly Part (2002 Hindi). She first gained significant recognition on television as the title character 'Pooja Mehta' in the popular Sony TV drama Ye Meri Life Hai (2003-2005). The performance earned her numerous nominations and awards, her wins including the 12th Annual Lion's Gold Awards' Critics' Choice "Best Actress" (2005), Sony TV's "Best Face" (2005), Indian Television Academy Awards' "GR8! Face of the Year" (2004), and "Best Debut" (2004). Sikander subsequently anchored Popkorn Newz (2007) and Jet Set Go (2008) before returning to film with lead role of 'Jiya' in Dhoom Dhadaka (2008). She subsequently appeared in the lead role of 'Shunyaa' on the supernatural thriller TV series Seven (2010-2011 Hindi) produced by Bollywood juggernaut Yash Raj Films. She was seen as 'Byankar Pari', the lead antagonist in the children's program Baal Veer (2012\u20132014) on SAB TV but quitted for her company\u000aSikander's production company Chocolate Box Films Pvt. Ltd., founded in late 2012, has yet to announce its first production.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Actor (early work) ===\u000aWhile working to establish herself in Mumbai's Bollywood industry, Sikander traveled hours, daily from the outskirts of the city to attend auditions, often accompanied by her brother, Rizwan Sikander, also an actor.\u000aHer film debut came at the age of 16, in 1998 with the Hindi-language feature film Prem Aggan produced and directed by acclaimed film personality Feroz Khan. After a friend suggested she screen test for the part, Sikander so impressed Feroz Khan that she landed the role, even though it had already been cast. Despite significant hype, the film, which also featured Feroz Khan's son Fardeen Khan's debut, was both a critical and box office failure. Nevertheless, one critic praised her screen presence and commented "[Sikander is] friendly to the viewers' eyes."\u000aA year later Sikander appeared in the Amir Khan starer Mann (1999 Hindi) in a cameo as Kamini. Directed by Indra Kumar the film received mixed reviews and did not do well at the box office. As with her debut in Prem Aggan, however, Sikander received positive reviews for her performance. Calling her "pretty and emotive", Mohammad Ali Ikram of Planet Bollywood exclaimed "Mark my words, this simple stunner has the ability to shine as a great performer and star".\u000aAnsh: The Deadly Part (2002) was Sikander's first supporting role in a Hindi language feature film. Portraying the character Kusum opposite south Indian actor Abbas, the film produced by Rukamanee Arts was a box office success doing reasonably well and garnering generally favorable reviews. Despite Ansh being her best-faring feature film so far, Sikander would not have another big screen release for the next six years.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Actor (2003\u2013present) ===\u000a\u000aThough her feature films failed to establish Sikander as a box office success, her Television debut portraying the title character 'Pooja Metha' in the popular Sony TV drama Ye Meri Life Hai (2003-2005) made the show a household name overnight, gave her "instant fame", and eventually elevated her to "one of the most loved faces on Indian television.". Her performance earned her numerous nominations, her wins including The Indian Television Academy Awards' "GR8 Face of the Year" (2004), The Indian Television Academy Awards' "Best Debut" (2004), The 12th Annual Lion's Gold Awards' "Best Actress: Critics' Choice" (2005), and Sony TV's "Best Face" (2005).\u000aFueled by the success of Ye Meri Life Hai and her subsequent performances, Sikander would be seen in frequent guest appearances on various popular programs including Batliwala House No. 43 (in 2005), C.I.D. (Indian TV series) (in 2006), Jodee Kamaal Ki (in 2007), Kaajjal (in 2008), and Man Mein Hai Visshwas (in 2009).\u000aBeginning in 2007 Sikander also featured as a TV program Host \u2013 first of entertainment channel Zoom's Popkorn Newz for a single season, and then in 2008, as the host of the STAR One travel-contest program Jet Set Go. An accomplished self-taught dancer and amateur singer, 2008 would also see Sikander appear on numerous programs including celebrity dance program Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena as a celebrity contestant alongside notable Indian cricketer Vinod Kambli (where she drew praise from Bollywood Superstar Sushmita Sen who called her "one of the most fabulous dancers I've ever seen"), next in the singing reality program Jjhoom India again as a celebrity contestant, as well as India's longest running dance program Boogie Woogie as a celebrity guest performer in 2010 and subsequently on multiple occasions as a performer as a guest judge. Her ability to showcase well in singing, dance, hosting as well as acting caused critics to comment on her versatility as a performer, identifying her as one of the few who have been able to navigate between film and television. While her TV career flourished, Sikander returned to film in 2008 with a supporting role in director Shashi Ranjan's Dhoom Dhadaka alongside notable Bollywood actors Jackie Shroff, Anupam Kher, Gulshan Grover, and Satish Kaushik. The film was a box office failure and regarded by critics as average to disappointing. Sify's Sonia Chopra commented that "The cast doesn't disappoint as much as the film", and that "Shama Sikander [is] earnest enough ... molten-hot and ... superbly styled".\u000a2010 saw Sikander return to a lead role in a television series for the first time since leaving Ye Meri Life Hai in 2005. Sikander's Shunyaa featured as the central character in the supernatural thriller series Seven (2010-2011 Hindi) produced by the Bollywood juggernaut Yash Raj Films. With a production budget far in excess of any television program that came before, YRF's Seven aired weekly episodes instead of daily, in contrast to its competing programing. Sikander's performance and the program as a whole was widely appreciated for being "daringly different", with its own "dedicated audience" eliciting a "huge response through ... platforms like internet, e-mails and social networking sites." Nevertheless perhaps due to its weekly format, lack of significant promotion, excessive production budget, and YRF's primary focus on its film division, Seven experienced only niche viewership and was eventually brought to a close after only one season of 26 episodes.\u000aAfter a short break Sikander took the role of the main antagonist, Byankar Pari, in the young-adult fantasy program Baal Veer starting in September 2012. Baal Veer stands as one of the channel's, and indeed the market segment's, highest rated programs. Sikander quit the show in 2014.\u000aIn March 2016, Sikander featured in the short film Sexaholic. Bollywoodlife.com noted that Sikander's performance is "treading into a territory, which would make many male actors balk, Shama is supremely comfortable with her choice."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Designer (2010\u2013present) ===\u000aOn 3 December 2010 Sikander launched her women's wear fashion label Saisha in the upscale Mumbai suburb of Bandra West, with the high profile and widely covered inauguration attended by her close friends and Bollywood superstars Sushmita Sen and Jackie Shroff. Sikander has showcased her collection numerous times since, often, but not always, appearing on the ramp in her own designs. Saisha has appeared both domestically in Hyderabad Fashion Week and Mumbai's Lakme Fashion Week, as well as internationally, most notably in South Africa.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Film, music and music video producer (2012\u2013present) ===\u000aOpting in late 2012 to divide her attention between performance and production, Sikander incorporated the Film and TV production company Chocolate Box Films Pvt. Ltd. which has yet to announce its first project.\u000aHaving previously featured in a number of music videos in Punjabi and other Indian languages (most notably for acclaimed singer Abhijeet) in late 2012 Sikander reportedly produced a (very sensuous) music video featuring herself alongside boyfriend actor / musician Alexx O'Nell picturising his original English language composition entitled 'Still on My Mind'. The video, which marks their first on screen collaboration has not yet been released, and it is uncertain if it was produced under the newly formed Chocolate Box Films Pvt. Ltd. banner. Reports also indicate that she may be producing an entire English language album authored by O'Nell.\u000a\u000a\u000a== In the media ==\u000aSikander's sex appeal has been picked up on by many sources, focussing on her fitness regimen, diet, and style sense.\u000aShe has been featured in numerous magazine spreads as well as appearing on the cover of GR8! Magazine more than any other actress, three times for the English Edition: March 2010, July 2006, February 2005, as well as at least twice for the Hindi Edition. She also appeared on the cover of Showtime Magazine in December 2011. Sikander was deemed October 2011's 'Hottie of the Month' by Perfect Woman Magazine, and featured in the 'Perfect Woman Spotlight' in May 2013 and Zing Magazine's 'Travel Diaries' in March 2013.\u000aAdditionally, Sikander has appeared in print and on the ramp supporting various notable fashion labels and designers including Manish Malhotra & Shaina NC, Neeta Lulla, Nisha Jamvwal, the world-renowned Ritu Kumar, as well as her own brand Saisha. In addition to heading the creative development of Saisha's women's wear designs, Sikander who has been referred to as a "fashion connoisseur" even reportedly contributed design expertise for the creation of wardrobe for her currently-running Baal Veer television program.\u000aListing among her activities kickboxing, power yoga and dance, Sikander has commented "fitness has always been an integral part of my daily routine ... I ensure that I work out everyday [sic] for at least an hour ... [I] eat right and think positive."\u000aSikander's hobbies, including the violin, photography and most recently abstract painting, often feature in media coverage.\u000aThe actress is also said to be multi-lingual, speaking six languages including Hindi, English, Urdu, Gujarati, Marathi and Marwadi (of her native Rajasthan).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Relationships ===\u000aIn 2010 Indian gossip columnist Vicky Lalwani linked Sikander to actor Mimoh Chakraborty \u2013 a claim both parties denied.\u000aIn mid-2011 speculation began regarding Sikander's relationship with India-based American actor / musician Alexx O'Nell The two were spotted with increasing frequency throughout 2011 and Sikander confirmed that they were indeed in a relationship in an interview which featured on the cover of Showtime Magazine's December 2011 issue, entitled "Shama Sikander Finally Breaks Her Silence on Her Relationship With Alexx O'Nell".

aVCondusiv Technologies is a software company based in Burbank, California. The company was formerly known as Diskeeper Corporation, a name derived from its flagship product, Diskeeper, a file-system defragmentation software package for Microsoft Windows and OpenVMS. Before adopting the Diskeeper name, the company was known as Executive Software International, Inc.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Products ==\u000aCondusiv Technologies sells and supports a number of software products. Diskeeper, a tool for reducing file fragmentation; V-locity Virtual Machine, a platform disk optimizer for virtual server; Undelete, which offers protection from and recovery of accidentally deleted files.\u000aCondusiv sells its products to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) including SanDisk, Samsung and LG. Condusiv OEM products include ExpressCache, which exploits a small-density SSD as a cache for a larger-capacity HDD, thus improving boot times and applications launch.\u000aThe company also has several technologies such as HyperFast, a solid-state drive optimizer, HyperBoot, a boot-time optimization technology; and InvisiTasking, which enables any process to run invisibly in the background.\u000aAnother technology introduced by the company in 2009 is IntelliWrite, an advanced file-system driver designed to leverage Windows\u2019 file system \u201cBest Fit\u201d file-write design in order to write a file in a non-fragmented state. IntelliWrite is designed to prevent most fragmentation before it happens in Windows computer systems, allowing for better file write performance plus compatibility and interoperability with other storage management products.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Company history ==\u000a\u000aIt was founded on July 22, 1981, by Craig Jensen. The company was initially created to serve VAX/VMS platforms. Because the product allowed companies to defragment without shutting their systems down, its original customer base was Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies, air traffic control, NASA and others with mission critical systems or systems that needed to be running 24/7.\u000aIn the early 1990s, Diskeeper was the best-selling third-party software product for Digital Equipment Corporation business computers. The company, then named Executive Software, placed on Software magazine\u2019s list of the Top 100 Independent Software Companies.\u000aIn 1995 the company was asked by Microsoft to develop products for its Windows NT system before it was released. One of Microsoft's original source code licensees, the company broke into the Windows market with the resulting defrag product for Windows NT.\u000aJerry Baldwin was appointed CEO in September 2011 and Craig Jensen passed his managerial and day-to-day involvement with the company on to Baldwin. Baldwin renamed the company to Condusiv Technologies and completely restructured and re-focused the company on Cloud, Virtualization and Optimization. The tagline "Think Faster" is now the company motto.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Founder ===\u000aWhile studying electrical engineering at Northwestern University in 1968, Craig Jensen took a night job as a computer operator to learn about computers. He went on to develop advanced operating systems for early technology pioneer Applied Data Research, and in 1974 moved to Data General Corporation. He founded Executive Software International in 1981, he says, "with an early personal computer and a box of file folders in his kitchen in Hollywood." Mr. Jensen stepped down as CEO in 2009. He is the author of The Craft of Computer Programming (New York: Warner Books, 1985) ISBN 978-0-446-38147-5.\u000aCraig Jensen is a member of the Church of Scientology and a member of the World Institute of Scientology Enterprises (WISE), an international membership organization whose members use the management technology of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology. He has stated that his employees are schooled in Hubbard's management technology, with courses that include Effective Leadership, Executives and Ethics, Executive Basics and Management by Statistics. However, with the change in CEO to Jerry Baldwin, the Hubbard Management Technology is no longer the standard at the company. With the departure of Baldwin in 2014 the company returned to using the Hubbard management Technology as its mantra under Craig Jensen who returned as CEO.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Controversy ===\u000aIn 2000, the inclusion of the functionality of the Home version of Diskeeper in Microsoft Windows 2000's Disk Defragmenter was the subject of an investigation by the German Federal Office of Security in Information Technology (BSI), which looked into whether Diskeeper poses a security threat to users by spying on users. In Germany the law bars state and federal governments from doing business with a member of the Church of Scientology, a government policy that has been criticized by the US State Department in 1999 and in a 1998 UN Report as discriminatory and government-condoned harassment. A Microsoft spokesman stated that Microsoft had extensively tested Diskeeper for security breaches and found the tool had no ability to store and transmit data on users, and there was no data transfer involved in its processes, but bowed to pressure, allowing users the option to remove it.\u000aOn November 5, 2008, Diskeeper's former CIO, Alexander Godelman, and Automation Planning Officer Marc Le Shay jointly filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court for improper dismissal. In the complaint they allege that the company required training in Hubbard Management courses, which are based on the management technology of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, as a condition of employment, and that failure to comply was cause for their dismissal. The plaintiffs cited this as a violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act and requested an injunction against the delivery of the courses at Diskeeper. On January 27, 2009, Diskeeper filed a motion to strike the proposed injunction, citing, without conceding that Hubbard Management Technology is religious in nature, legal precedence of religious based practices in business being protected by the First Amendment. On February 18, 2009 the motion to strike was granted and the proposed injunction removed from the case. On June 24, 2009 the case was dismissed in its entirety.\u000aIn 1991, the company (back then Executive Software) denied Ciba-Geigy technical support for the VAX version of Diskeeper after learning that Ciba-Geigy makes Ritalin, a drug opposed by Scientologists (see also Scientology and psychiatry).\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000a"How to Defragment Your Disk Drive Volumes in Windows XP".

aV"Free Ride" is a song written by Dan Hartman and performed by The Edgar Winter Group. The single, engineered by Jim Reeves, was a top 20 US hit in 1973, hitting number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\u000aThe single 45 version is distinctly different from the LP version. The 45 version contains a significantly brighter guitar track (that opens the song only on the left channel), added harmonics, a fuzz bass added to the bridge, and other changes that contrast sharply with the "dry" LP mix. Most classic rock radio stations play the LP version, and the original 45 mix is much less commonly available online. Both versions clock in at virtually the same length because each was based on the same core "take" and re-mixed with different tracks to the fore as well as added enhancements to the single.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Charts ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aLyrics of this song at MetroLyrics

aVThe Cowichan Valley is a region around the Cowichan River, Cowichan Bay and Cowichan Lake on Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, Canada. There is some debate as to the origin of the name Cowichan, which many believe to be an anglicized form of the First Nations tribal name Quw'utsun.\u000aCommunities that lie within the actual Cowichan River/Cowichan Bay watershed include Duncan, Lake Cowichan, Cowichan Bay, Cowichan Station and Maple Bay. Other nearby communities are affiliated mainly through the Cowichan Valley Regional District. Crofton and Chemainus, lie within the Chemainus River Valley, while Cobble Hill, Shawnigan Lake, Mill Bay, and Ladysmith inhabit a coastal plain that includes the Cowichan and Chemainus River deltas.\u000aThe Cowichan Valley is the home of a growing number of vineyards and wineries. They include Cherry Point Vineyards, Blue Grouse, Glenterra, Vigneti Zanatta, Venturi-Schulze, and Averill Creek. The warm, dry summers and mild, moist winters make this area part of Canada's only maritime Mediterranean climate, providing good growing conditions for many grape varietals.\u000aThe Trans Canada Trail goes through the Valley, and there are numerous options for hiking enthusiasts. On January 7, 2010 an air quality monitoring station was installed.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Socorro wren (Troglodytes sissonii) is a species of bird in the family Troglodytidae. It is endemic to Socorro Island, Mexico. It was formerly placed in Thryomanes but was moved to Troglodytes considering "manners, song, plumage, etc." and by biogeography and mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence analysis.\u000aIts natural habitats is the tropical arid Croton masonii\u2013prickly pear shrubland and occasionally the more humid forest. It appears to prefer this habitat, limiting its presence above 600 m (2000 ft) although it does range over the whole island.\u000aDuring visits in 1953, the birds were observed to be out of breeding season in mid-March; territorial males were observed in mid-late November.\u000aThe main limiting factors are by habitat destruction due to feral sheep and predation by feral cats. In 1953, it was noted to be unwary. However, the IUCN does not yet consider it threatened, because especially compared to the larger birds of Socorro, it has fared not too badly and remains among the most common local landbirds.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Footnotes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVMario Joseph Gabelli (born June 19, 1942) is an American stock investor, investment advisor, and financial analyst. He is the founder, chairman, and CEO of Gabelli Asset Management Company Investors (GAMCO Investors), an investment firm headquartered in Rye, New York. Forbes Magazine listed him as #346 on the list of wealthiest Americans in the 2006 Forbes 400 and estimated his net worth at $1 billion as of 2011.\u000aGabelli founded his firm in 1977 as a broker/dealer, and the company has since grown into the diversified financial services corporation. He was paid $55 million in 2004. His pay of $58.2 million in 2006 was "more than the pay of any senior executive of a major Wall Street firm" that year, despite the fact that he manages only a fraction of the assets of larger Wall Street companies. Gabelli was paid $45.9 million in 2008 at Gamco Investors, a 35% decrease compared to his 2007 compensation of $70.9 million.\u000aGabelli is a leading proponent of the Graham-Dodd school of security analysis and pioneered the application of Graham and Dodd's principles to the analysis of domestic, cash generating, franchise companies in a very wide range of industries. His proprietary Private Market Value methodology is now an analytical standard in the value investing community.\u000aGabelli is a Chartered Financial Analyst, a member and former officer of the New York Society of Security Analysts, the New York Society of Auto Analysts and the Entertainment Analysts Group of New York.\u000aGabelli has been a frequent commentator on CNBC, Bloomberg, and CNN, and appeared ten times on Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street. Gabelli is often written about in the financial print media including Institutional Investor, Business Week, Fortune, Forbes, Money, and Changing Times. He has also written articles for investment publications such as the Financial Analysts Handbook and for the GAMCO blog.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aGabelli, the son of Italian immigrants, was born in The Bronx and went to Fordham Preparatory School, where he graduated in 1961. He has said he read market reports for fun when he was very young and that he bought his first stock when he was 13 years old.\u000aGabelli won a scholarship and graduated from Fordham University summa cum laude in 1965. He received his Master of Business Administration degree from Columbia Business School. At Columbia, he was taught by Roger Murray, noted value investing professor and co-author of the Fifth Edition of Security Analysis, The Graham & Dodd Value Investing Bible. Gabelli and his firm later launched the Graham & Dodd, Murray, Greenwald Award for Distinguished Value Investors. This award is presented yearly at his Annual Client Symposium.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aAfter graduation, Gabelli accepted a position at Loeb, Rhoades & Co. as a security analyst responsible for coverage of farm equipment, auto parts conglomerates and later media and broadcasting. Gabelli was putting into practice the theory of value investing that he learned at Columbia. He rated companies not by earnings but cash flow, analyzing a firm in great detail to calculate what he called private-market value: not the share price at which a stock was selling on an exchange, but the price per share someone would be willing to pay in order to buy the whole company. This method would be widely used in the 1980s in leveraged buyouts, in which a public company's managers would buy their company, or at least a considerable part of it, and take it private. The calculations employed were often not the same as the standard valuation measures for public companies. This methodology was later trademarked as The Gabelli Private Market Value with a Catalyst Methodology.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Gabelli & Co. ===\u000aIn 1976, Gabelli formed Gabelli & Co., an institutional brokerage house, with borrowed funds and money he had accumulated trading his own account. Soon after Gabelli formed Gabelli Investors ( later GAMCO Investors) to manage money for clients. After sending a memo to a Barron's editor touting a company he fancied, Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., Gabelli landed on the cover of this financial weekly. By 1981, GAMCO had 81 accounts and was managing about $33 million. Despite the rocky economy and stagnant stock market or the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gabelli made money for his clients each year. While investors were seeking to get in on the ground floor of a company's growth, Gabelli preferred to cash in on a company's death. During the next few years, he invested in or recommended companies that were taken over by other firms or privatized.\u000aBy the mid 1980s Gabelli was managing over $350 million in client assets and compounding returns at more than 35 percent per year. While Business Week was touting the "Death of Equities" on its cover, Gabelli was quoted as saying "I don't need a rising market to bail me out." Gabelli's firm was doing all its own research, usually with the idea of identifying firms that might be candidates for leveraged buyouts: those with characteristics such as a large amount of cash on hand, underlying assets such as real estate, or a large block of stock in the hands of a company founder with no children. He also looked for companies in industries where new competition was difficult and cash flow was high. Once Gabelli selected such a stock, he was willing to wait for years until it appreciated. He began buying Cowles Communications, Inc., for example, in 1977 at $14 a share and eventually became its biggest stockholder. In 1984, the company (now Cowles Media Co.) was privatized at $46 a share, for a total payoff to Gabelli's clients of $33 million. Another media winner was Chris-Craft, whose BHC Communications achieved almost a sixfold pretax gain in income over six years in the 1980s and in the 1990s assembled its own network, United Television. The relentless Gabelli was visiting about 50 companies a year to gain information and meeting the managers of more than 100 other corporations annually, as well as getting together with other portfolio managers to discuss ideas and reading about 20 trade journals, two or three newspapers, and a number of industry and company reports. He also was writing research reports for his brokerage customers and portfolio-manager and other professional-investor clients. "I read annual reports instead of novels," Gabelli told Jerry Edgerton of Money in 1986. As a narrowly focused investor with large holdings in a few companies, he was able to bring influence to bear on company management.\u000aBetween 1978 and 1985, Gabelli's portfolios outperformed the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks each year and more than doubled the results of this S&P index in five of those years. Between 1977 and 1988, Gamco Investors' assets appreciated at an annual compounded rate of 28 percent, a rate exceeded by very few money managers. This money management entity had never lost money over a year and had met Gabelli's objective of ten percent annual return after taxes and inflation in all but two years. GAMCO Investors' equity assets, flush with cash invested by company pension funds, reached $1.6 billion in 1986.\u000a\u000a\u000a== The Gabelli Mutual Funds ==\u000aGabelli's first investment vehicle for the general public, The Gabelli Asset Fund, launched in March 1986 as a no-load fund requiring a minimum of $25,000 to invest. Later, and today, this fund is available for a minimum investment of $1,000 and accepts IRA investments without a minimum. The Asset Fund was later followed on by The Gabelli Equity Trust, a closed-end fund, which, at the time, was the largest equity offering on the NYSE. By the end of 1988, Gabelli's firm had three mutual funds\u2014two run by himself\u2014with combined assets of $650 million.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Fund Manager of the Year - 1997 ==\u000aIn 1997, when ten Gabelli equity funds averaged a return of 31.7 percent, the best of any U.S. mutual fund group, Gabelli was honored by Morningstar, Inc. as the domestic equity fund manager of the year.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Philanthropy ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== University of Nevada, Reno ===\u000aIn December 2013, the University of Nevada, Reno announced it had received a $1.5 million donation from the Gabelli Foundation to help pay for the construction of the E. L. Wiegand Fitness Center.\u000aGabelli is a member of the Wiegand Foundation\u2019s board of trustees. In September, the Wiegand Foundation gave the largest donation in its history of $8 million as the lead gift toward the construction of the four-story fitness center.\u000a\u201cAs a trustee of the E. L. Wiegand Foundation, I was moved by the university\u2019s vision of taking care of the \u2018whole student,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gabelli said.\u000aThe Gabelli Foundation is based in Reno, and Gabelli has visited Reno numerous times and toured the UNR campus last summer. \u201cIf you go to a Jesuit school, they have a philosophy about the body and the mind that says in order to get your mind to work, you have to have your body in shape,\u201d said Gabelli, a graduate of Fordham University, a Jesuit institution in New York. \u201cI\u2019m into that kind of holistic approach.\u201d\u000aHe said an institution\u2019s faculty and facilities are the top two things that attract students to a campus. \u201cThis donation was an easy way to hitchhike on the Wiegand Foundation\u2019s gift, and once we get there, we will look at another opportunity to help UNR,\u201d Gabelli, said, referring to the fitness center\u2019s anticipated opening in late 2016. UNR President Marc Johnson said the E. L. Wiegand Fitness Center will allow students to more fully integrate wellness into their daily lives.\u000a\u201cWe are deeply grateful to Mr. Gabelli for generously supporting this milestone project,\u201d Johnson said.The fitness center will be built on the parking lot north of the Brian Whalen Parking Complex.Its location bordering North Virginia Street will complete a vision for the university as an institution that nurtures students\u2019 minds with the Mathewson-IGT Knowledge Center, their spirit with the Joe Crowley Student Union and their bodies with a new fitness center, Johnson said.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Columbia Graduate Business School ===\u000aIn July 2013, The Gabelli Foundation pledged an additional $15 million. This gift is earmarked for the construction of Columbia Business School's new Manhattanville campus. The building is scheduled to open in 2018.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Fordham University ===\u000aAmong those recognized at the 2010 Fordham University Founder\u2019s Award Dinner were Mario J. Gabelli, CBA \u201965, and Regina M. Pitaro, FCRH \u201976, a Fordham trustee and managing director of GAMCO Asset Management. In September 2010, Fordham formally announced Gabelli\u2019s $25 million gift, the largest ever in the university\u2019s history. The gift allowed Fordham, which renamed the undergraduate business college the Gabelli School of Business, to expand student scholarships and faculty chairs, and is crucial to the creation of the Center of Global Investment Analysis which brings together students, faculty and professionals in the financial community to enhance scholarship in the study and understanding of capital markets.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Gabelli gift lifts alma mater ====\u000aThursday, September 27, Fordham unveiled a new 50,000-square-foot building for its undergraduate business school.\u000aThe building, in the heart of the university's 85-acre campus in the Bronx, cost $38 million to renovate. It will now have the latest technology for education, lounge space on every floor and ample Bloomberg machines\u2014not to mention a Roman fountain.\u000aIt is only part of the business school's efforts to boost its standing, however.\u000aAs part of the institution's capital campaign, renowned investor Mario Gabelli, chief executive of Gamco Investors Inc. and a Fordham alum, pledged $25 million, the biggest gift the university has ever received. The funds helped push the business school's donations to $50 million, $10 million over its goal. In honor of his gift, it has been named the Gabelli School of Business.\u000aBut instead of putting his money into brick and mortar like many philanthropists, Gabelli \u2014 who said this is the biggest single gift he has made yet \u2014wanted his grant to help build the school's faculty.\u000a"My heart and soul is based on education and giving back to help the system," said Gabelli, who also contributes to Columbia Business School and Boston College, among others. "And what makes a good university is faculty." His money will endow six faculty chairs, create a visiting-professor program and support a new center for global value investing\u2014a highly unusual program for an undergraduate business school.\u000aDonna Rapaccioli, dean of the business school, said Gabelli's support has already put it on an upward trajectory. This year, the college received more than 7,100 applications for 395 spaces in its freshman class, up from 6,000 applications the previous year.\u000a"Mario's gift certainly added to making Fordham a hot school, and this new facility is adding to that," Ms. Rapaccioli said.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Fordham University Ph. D. Program ===\u000aIn 2014, Mario Gabelli funded the University's ability to initiate the Gabelli Ph.D. Program which will establish a doctoral-level business program at Fordham's Gabelli School of Business.\u000a"We are, of course, deeply pleased by Mario's latest gift," said Joseph M. McShane, S.J., president of Fordham. "Pleased for what it means for business education at Fordham and pleased for the vote of confidence from a world class investor. Mario's generous gift builds on his legacy, and adds significantly to the Fordham School of Business intellectual capital."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Boston College ===\u000aIn September 2010, Boston College announced Gabelli\u2019s $3 million gift that was used to endow a professorship in finance in the college\u2019s Carroll School of Management. An undergraduate dormitory is also named after Gabelli because of a past donation to the school. Previously, Gabelli, who serves on the college\u2019s board of trustees, gave $10 million to create the Gabelli Distinguished Presidential Scholars Fund which provides fifteen students with full tuition every year.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Presidential Scholars Program ===\u000aIn 2014, Boston College's Presidential Scholars Program was renamed the Gabelli Presidential Scholars Program as a result of a major gift from the Gabelli Family Foundation.\u000aThe program provides an integrated educational experience within the University's honors program. The program has 264 alumni and currently enrolls 72 of BC's most accomplished students.\u000aMr. Gabelli has been one of the program's most generous and ardent supporters since its inception in 1991.\u000a"It is fitting that this program be named in honor of Mario Gabelli, who has been so committed to advancing it over the past 25 years," said University President William P. Leahy, SJ. "I am grateful to the Gabelli Family Foundation for its generous gift in support of our Presidential Scholars".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The Gabelli Foundation's Recent Gift to Boston College ===\u000aIn December 2015, The Gabelli Foundation made a contribution to Boston College to further the Foundation's commitment to the Jesuit philosophy of enhancing the intellectual, spiritual and physical aspects of the whole person. Gabelli commented on the recent gift by saying "we believe the United States has flourished because of the Rule of Law, the free market system and meritocracy. The underpinning of meritocracy is education. We believe for the great educational institutions to succeed, the institution needs facilities (Gabelli Hall), faculties (The Endowed Chair), students (Gabelli Presidential Scholars) and financing. To this we add the Jesuit philosophy of the whole person. Our recent gift was intended for the Athletic Department." The Gabelli Foundation's commitment serves to further support Boston College's ability to provide students with a great educational experience which prepares them to succeed as the next generation of leaders.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Roger Williams University - Mario J. Gabelli School of Business ===\u000aThe Roger Williams University Mario J. Gabelli School of Business was established in 1995, three years after the university conferred an honorary doctor of business degree on Gabelli. In subsequent years, Gabelli has continued to support the school through additional financial pledges as well as being a mentor to students through the University's Leadership Institute Distinguished Leaders Lecture Series.\u000aAs an Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accredited school - a distinction less than 5%of the world's 13,0000 business schools have earned in recognition for their academic programs - GSB hosts an active chapter of the Beta Gamma Sigma honor society as well as a chapter of the Delta Sigma Pi professional fraternity.\u000aThe Center for Advanced Financial Education (CAFE) program allows students to manage two real dollar portfolios in real time. CAFE is an award-winning program, having captured two highly competitive, portfolio management based, national championships in 2013-14. Current, industry standard, trading room technology, including Bloomberg terminals and Bloomberg certification is available for finance and other majors.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== University of Miami ===\u000aIn 2011, a gift from Gabelli enabled the School of Business Administration to establish a new endowed professorship. The Gabelli Asset Management Endowed Professorship will provide critical support of the University\u2019s faculty, research and services initiatives. In addition the Finance Professorship, GAMCO has supported the school\u2019s academic initiatives, scholarships, mentoring and job placement initiatives.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Barron's All-Century Team ==\u000aOn January 10, 2000, Gabelli was inducted into the Barron's All-Century Team, their list of the most influential mutual fund industry portfolio managers. \u000a\u000a\u000a== The third decade ==\u000aBy 1998, Gabelli Asset Management Inc. was managing $16.3 billion. In February 1999, the company went public selling 6 million shares, or about twenty percent of the common stock at $17.50 per share.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Fred Mancheski/other ==\u000aIn March 2006, a judge awarded partial summary judgment in favor of claims that Gabelli had unfairly prevented investor Frederick Mancheski, who invested $50,000 in 1977, from selling his shares in Gabelli Group Capital Partners (GGCP) at fair market prices. In the ensuing settlement, GGCP distributed assets on a pari passu basis including nearly two million shares of NYSE listed GAMCO and approximately $20 million in cash. Contrary to statements, Mancheski still controls over 90% of the shares that were distributed.\u000aIn 2001, whistleblower Rufus Taylor III filed a civil lawsuit against several companies owned by Gabelli, alleging fraudulent practices in FCC auctions between 1995 and 2000. In those auctions, the government set aside cell phone licenses to be sold to small businesses. Taylor's lawsuit said that Gabelli used more than twelve "sham" startup companies to meet the requirements of a small business applicant in the auctions and acquire the licenses at a small business discount.\u000aThe "whistleblower" actually was an attorney who once worked in the telecommuncations business for LICT's competitor Adelphia which went bankrupt. These parties were not sued by the government or private plaintiffs.\u000aThe lawsuit allegations claim Gabelli, by virtue of his role in publicly traded LICT Corp., was fraudulent because Gabelli had de facto control over the companies and had aggregate assets that far exceeded the ceiling of the small business criteria, which would disqualify an applicant from the small business discount auctions. Supposedly, many other participants, both individuals as well as corporations, in the wireless auctions, totally unrelated to Gabelli, also set up business arrangements to take advantage of the small business discount and succeeded, even though in reality they too could not pass the small business criteria. The government stood on the sideline and did not take up the suit for the American public.\u000aIndeed, LICT's FCC attorney stated that Gabelli complied with FCC requirements. The suit had alleged that the Gabelli-backed false "entrepreneurs" included an NBA player, a related party, a former partner of an accounting firm, an aerobics instructor, and even the caretaker of a vacation home in part owned by Gabelli. On July 12, 2006, the suit was settled when the bidding entities reportedly agreed to pay $130 million to settle the allegations.\u000aGabelli's money management business, GAMCO Investors, Inc., was not a party to the lawsuit. Neither Gabelli nor his companies nor any of the other parties were charged. The Government did not pursue any other wireless auction participants in the small business discount area. LICT and other FCC auction participants continue to participate in the ongoing auctions of wireless spectrum and other FCC license auctions.\u000a\u000a\u000a== The Fourth Decade ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Institutional Investor - Money Manager of the Year ===\u000aThe Institutional Investor selected Mario Gabelli as 2010 Money Manager of the Year for its second annual U.S. Investment Management Awards. The award selection was based on performance as well as a survey by U.S. institutions. In 2010, GAMCO returned 28.6% for institutional clients. Since inception in 1977, it has generated annualized returns of 16.3%.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Boston College ===\u000aOn April 27, 2012, Mario J. Gabelli was at the 24th annual Boston College Wall Street Council Tribute Dinner in New York City\u2019s Waldorf-Astoria. Mario was presented with the President\u2019s Medal for Excellence in recognition of his achievements, exemplifying the Boston College motto \u201cEver to Excel.\u201d The black-tie dinner drew more than 1,000 guests.\u000aGabelli is a founding member of the Boston College Wall Street Council, a network of more than 1,700 BC alumni, parents and friends who work in and represent the financial community in New York. Through its annual dinners, the council has raised more than $25.6 million for BC\u2019s Presidential Scholars Program. Boston College\u2019s most academically gifted undergraduates are chosen for the Presidential Scholars Program, an extraordinary honors program that combines rigorous course work, community service, international experience and internships.\u000aSince its inception, more than 200 Presidential Scholars have graduated, earning some of nation's most prestigious academic awards, including Rhodes Scholarships, Fulbright Grants, Marshall Scholarships, National Science Foundation Fellowships, Truman Scholarships, Beckman Scholarships, and many others.\u000aGabelli established the Gabelli Distinguished Presidential Scholarship and is a lead supporter of the Presidential Scholars Program. In addition, he has served as a University Trustee and Trustee Associate and has endowed the Mario J. Gabelli Professorship in Finance in the Carroll School of Management. In 1995, the residence hall at 80 Commonwealth Avenue was named in honor of Mr. Gabelli.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Columbia Business School - Distinguished Leadership in Business Award ===\u000aOn May 4, 2015, at Columbia Business School's 39th Annual Dinner, Mario Gabelli was presented with the school's Distinguished Leadership in Business Award. Gabelli is a leading proponent of the Graham & Dodd school of security analysis which he learned while studying for his MBA at Columbia. He is a member of the school's Board of Overseers.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Columbus Day Pararde - Grand Marshal ===\u000aWhen Mario Gabelli leads the way down Fifth Avenue for the over 35,000 participants expected to march in the 68th annual Columbus Day Parade on Oct. 8, he\u2019ll join a list of notable New Yorkers who have presided over the celebration as grand marshal that stretches back to its beginnings in 1929. It\u2019s an esteemed list of honorees that includes men and women recognized for their contributions as Italian Americans by the Columbus Citizens Foundation (CCF), a non-profit organization that fosters appreciation for Italian-American heritage and achievement here in New York City through a slew of cultural and charitable activities, as well as scholarship and grant programs for students.\u000aGabelli\u2019s appreciation of the honor was apparent during a recent phone interview. Of the many awards he\u2019s received throughout his 45-year career in the financial industry, which include the CCF award for Business and Education; the Ellis Island Medal of Honor for Business Leaders; the South Bronx Educational Foundation\u2019s distinguished Public Service Award and the Sacred Heart University\u2019s Discovery Award, presiding over the Columbus Day Parade on behalf of CCF, of which he\u2019s been a member since 1976, is especially rewarding given Gabelli\u2019s advocacy for academics and CCF\u2019s legacy of supplementing the education of deserving students. The pairing is particularly fitting. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s about providing some sort of visibility and leadership for what we do to help individuals that need scholarships to go to school,\u201d says Gabelli, a Bronx native and first-generation Italian American whose mother and older sister were both born in Italy. \u201cThat\u2019s very fundamental to me. It underscores the meritocracy of this country. It underscores that education is the great driver and underpinning of that meritocracy, so the notion of equal opportunity for everyone is alive and well, and we want to keep it that way.\u201d\u000aGabelli himself graduate from Fordham and holds an M.B.A. from Columbia University Graduate School of Business and honorary doctorates from Roger Williams University in Rhode Island and Fordham University. He is a trustee of the Columbia University Graduate School of Business, Boston College and Roger Williams University. He also serves on the boards of The American-Italian Cancer Foundation, The Foundation for Italian Art & Culture, The Winston Churchill Foundation and the E.I. Wiegand Foundation. In 2010, he donated $25 million to Fordham University, the largest gift in the school\u2019s history, for its undergraduate business program, known now as the Fordham University Gabelli School of Business.\u000aIn 1977, Gabelli started GAMCO Investors, Inc., an investment consulting firm esteemed within the financial industry as a provider of investment advice, alternative investments and mutual funds, as well as institutional and private wealth management. Gabelli has created mutual funds that have consistently been recognized as among the industry\u2019s top performers. His \u201cPrivate Market with a Catalyst\u201d is widely recognized for its visionary and innovative research methodology that focuses on individual stock selection by identifying firms selling below intrinsic value with catalysts to realize the value. Thirty-five years after founding the company, as chairman and chief executive officer, Gabelli is still actively involved in GAMCO\u2019s everyday operations. He travels often on business, but is looking forward to being in the city for Columbus Day, and says now that he\u2019s returned to New York from a recent business trip, the totality of his impending duties as grand marshal are starting to take effect.\u000a\u201cI did talk about it this morning with my wife,\u201d Gabelli says. \u201cI think the last time I walked down a parade was probably when I was in high school. The Columbus Day Parade happens on a Monday when Wall Street\u2019s open, so historically, I\u2019ve never tried to take the day off from work, but am more than delighted to do it this year\u201d. \u000a\u000a\u000a=== Iona College ===\u000aOn April 12, 2013, Mario Gabelli received the 2013 Legacy Award from Iona College. The award was presented during the 51st Annual Trustee Dinner at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City and it exemplifies the college's mission of service, scholarship and value-based learning.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Roger Murray - Value Investing 20 Years Later ===\u000aOn April 17, 2013, GAMCO Asset Management together with the Gabelli Center for Global Investment Analysis at Fordham University hosted a 20th Anniversary presentation entitled "Value Investing 20 Years Later: A Celebration of the Roger Murray Lecture Series 1993-2013" at The Paley Center for Media in New York City. The focus of the presentation was the value approach to investing pioneered by Professor Benjamin Graham and David Dodd and further developed by Professor Roger Murray and current Professor Bruce Greenwald of the Columbia University Graduate School of Business.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The World's 99 Greatest Investors: The Secret of Success ===\u000aThe following is an excerpt from The World's 99 Greatest Investors: The Secret of Success by Magnus Angenfelt:\u000a"Buy what you know. Develop a core competency in an industry or industries and invest there. Become an expert - read every trade publication, talk to every company management (public or private), and go to every company and industry presentation in your area of competence. Do hard work. Create spreadsheets on companies you want to buy, breaking out earnings, cash flows, and private market values for each stock. Model numbers for the next five years. Focus on companies that have a stock price below intrinsic value. Look for a margin of safety. Look for a catalyst or event that will help surface values. Then remember investing is for the long term.\u000aWork hard - that's the best advice I can give anyone. The world is full of smart people. Those who are smart and also willing to make sacrifices to truly excel in their profession will be the biggest successes.\u000aI think the real bargains are what they would call the smaller, ignored, and unloved companies."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Foreign Policy Association ===\u000aOn June 27, 2013 at the Foreign Policy Association's 95th Anniversary and Annual Dinner, Mr. Gabelli was awarded the Foreign Policy Association Medal which recognizes individuals who demonstrate responsible internationalism and work to expand public knowledge of international affairs.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== New York Society of Security Analysts - Lifetime Achievement Award ===\u000aAt its annual dinner on October 7, 2014, the New York Society of Security Analysts awarded Mario J. Gabelli the Irving Kahn Lifetime Achievement Award. This award is presented to a member of the investment profession who has made distinctive contributions to the industry and whose exemplary achievement, execellence of practice, and true leadership have elevated the integrity and competence of the profession. Gabelli's role as a leading proponent of the Graham & Dodd, Murray, Greenwald value investing methodoloy has made him an industry leader.\u000a\u000a\u000a== National Italian American Foundation ==\u000aOn October 17, 2015, Gabelli was honored by the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) at their 40th Anniversary Gala in Washington, D.C. with their Leadership and Service Award recognizing him as an Italian American who has distinguished himself in business and made a significant contribution to NIAF. Gabelli is a former member of the Board of Directors of NIAF.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aAngenfelt, Magnus (2013).

aVKandalla Balagopal (Telugu: \u0c15\u0c02\u0c26\u0c3e\u0c33\u0c4d\u0c32 \u0c2c\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c17\u0c4b\u0c2a\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c4d) (10 June 1952 \u2013 8 October 2009) was an uncompromising human rights activist, mathematician and lawyer who was known for his work on the issue of civil liberties and human rights. He was a staunch civil liberties activist in Andhra Pradesh. He had broken away from the Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee (APCLC), with which he was associated since its inception in \u201880\u2019s, on the issue of violence perpetrated by the erstwhile CPI-ML Peoples War. He was a prolific writer on people\u2019s issues and had recently written about the developments on the Maoist front in west Bengal.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aK. Balagopal was the fifth child of middle class Telugu Brahmin couple Kandalla Parthanatha Sarma and Nagamani. His father\u2019s job in the insurance sector entailed frequent transfers and Balagopal\u2019s education was in several towns of AP, from Nellore to Vizianagaram. After Pre-University education in Kavali and BSc in Tirupati, he took an MSc and PhD in Mathematics from the Regional Engineering College in Warangal before proceeding to Delhi for a post-doctoral at the Indian Statistical Institute. He returned to Warangal in 1981, where he started teaching Maths at the Kakatiya University. This was also the time when he decided on social activism and joined the Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aK. Balagopal was a brilliant mathematician, he began his career as a teacher in Warangal but soon turned full-time human rights activist. He was a Mathematics professor at Kakatiya University before quitting in 1985.He did his Phd in Kakatiya University. He chose to become a lawyer much later, after getting fully associated with the human rights movement.\u000aK.Balagopal served as the general secretary of Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee (APCLC) between 1983 and 1997. Following sharp differences of opinion within the APCLC on how to respond to revolutionary violence he left APCLC and formed the Human Rights Forum.\u000aOver a period of 26 years, he documented and took up cases of thousands of extrajudicial killings by government forces in Andhra Pradesh and elsewhere. When the erstwhile people\u2019s war cadres resorted to a rash of kidnaps in late \u201880\u2019s, a vigilante organisation \u2018Praja Bandhu\u2019 abducted him demanding the release of two policemen from naxalite custody. The \u2018Praja Bandhu\u2019 which was suspected to have been floated by the state police had released him only after the abducted policemen were let off.\u000aFirst introduced to Marxism through reading DD Kosambi, K. Balagopal followed a dialectical Marxist method in scores of articles published in the Economic and Political Weekly until the early 90s. Deeply disturbed by the collapse of the Soviet Union, Balagopal began to explore humanist traditions in Marxism for answers. His articles in the 90s especially in Telugu reflect this shift.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Human Rights Forum ===\u000aBalagopal founded the Human Rights Forum in Andhra Pradesh.\u000aHis public criticism of the acts of violence by Maoists attracted severe criticism from the naxalites. Following his comments on the violence in Lalgarh in West Bengal, Maoist Central Committee member, Mallojula Koteshwar Rao had challenged Balagopal to visit Lalgarh resistance area to know the real picture.\u000aHe served as a member of the Expert Group on Development Challenges in Extremist Affected Areas, set up by Planning Commission of India in 2008.He genuinely believed that human rights are indivisible. He was known for his simple living and his extremely sharp analytical articles that appeared regularly in Economic and Political Weekly.His incisive articles in EPW included issues ranging from the regime of Indira Gandhi, Reservations issue, human rights violations from time to time in different places, the Gujarat riots, Special Economic Zones, land acquisition, sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes in Andhra Pradesh, the failure of talks between the YSR Government and the CPI-Maoists and so on. He was a prolific writer in Telugu.\u000aHis Telugu essay 'Cheekati Konaalu' was a path-breaking one, in which he directly questioned the violation of human rights by those who claimed that they were working for a radical revolution. After the formation of Human Rights Forum, he expanded his activities and visited areas undergoing intense social turmoil in Jammu and Kashmir, Gujarat, West Bengal and Orissa. In Orissa his fact-finding teams visited Rayagada district and documented the perspective of people displaced by Utkal Allumina Project, Jagatsinghpur district in respect of people affected by proposed Posco steel plant and Kandhamal district, which was affected by communal and ethnic clashes in 2007/2008. Not only was he an intellectual giant,but he had his heart for the deprived and down-trodden. He analysed critically and exposed the hypocrisy in the functioning of most of the mainstream political parties.\u000aK.Balagopal started practicing law nearly a decade ago and has argued dozens of cases pertaining to encounter killings by the police.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Death ==\u000aK. Balagopal died of lung aspiration following bleeding of stomach ulcer in Hyderabad on the night of 8 October 2009.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aK. Balagopal was married to Vasanta Lakshmi, a journalist currently working in Andhra Jyothy newspaper.

aVJamie Ross is a fictional character on the TV drama Law & Order, created by Rene Balcer and portrayed by Carey Lowell from 1996 to 1998. She also appears in the short-lived Law & Order spin-off Law & Order: Trial by Jury, by which time the character has become a judge. She appeared in 52 episodes (49 episodes of Law & Order, one episode of Homicide: Life on the Street, and two episodes of Law & Order: Trial by Jury)\u000a\u000a\u000a== As series regular ==\u000aThe character was introduced in 1996 as a former defense attorney who graduated from law school at Columbia University. She enters the Manhattan District Attorney's office as an Assistant District Attorney, replacing Claire Kincaid (Jill Hennessy), who had been killed in a car accident in the previous episode. She initially has a rocky relationship with her superior Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) because his penchant for bending trial rules goes against her liberal idealism and sense of legal ethics. While the two never see perfectly eye-to-eye, they eventually grow to be close friends.\u000aDuring the 1997-98 season, Ross's personal and professional life is thrown into disarray by a custody battle with her ex-husband, Neil Gorton (Keith Szarabajka), over their daughter Katie. For the next year, the brutal litigation against her ex-husband (who is also a lawyer, with whom she used to work) leaves her with increasingly less time to devote to her job. She leaves the DA's office in the 1998 episode "Monster", to remarry and find a job that gives her more time to be with her family. She is replaced by Abbie Carmichael (Angie Harmon) in the following episode, "Cherished".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Guest appearances ==\u000aLowell returned to the character in the 1999 episode "Justice", in which Ross and McCoy share a courtroom as adversaries. Once again a defense attorney, she represents a client McCoy is prosecuting for murder. When McCoy discovers she had violated that defendant's confidence in a previous action, Ross recuses herself. She reports herself to the Disciplinary Committee of the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, which eventually exonerates her with help from McCoy's testimony on her behalf.\u000aRoss appears on the Homicide: Life of the Street episode "Baby It's You", where she assists in the prosecution of the primary suspect in the murder of a teen model.\u000aLowell appears as Ross again, as a defense attorney, in the 2001 episode "School Daze", when she represents a student who had killed several classmates in a school shooting. At first, Ross has the upper hand, getting a handgun and other evidence dismissed due to a suppression ruling against detectives Lennie Briscoe (Jerry Orbach) and Ed Green (Jesse L. Martin), who use privileged medical information from a school psychiatrist to identify the suspect following an anonymous e-mail threatening to "come back and finish the job".

aVHigher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, conservatories, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education. The right of access to higher education is mentioned in a number of international human rights instruments. The UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 declares, in Article 13, that "higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education". In Europe, Article 2 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, adopted in 1950, obliges all signatory parties to guarantee the right to education.\u000aIn the days when few pupils progressed beyond primary education or basic education, the term "higher education" was often used to refer to secondary education, which can create some confusion. This is the origin of the term high school for various schools for children between the ages of 14 and 18 (United States) or 11 and 18 (UK and Australia).\u000a\u000aHigher education includes teaching, research, exacting applied work (e.g. in medical schools and dental schools), and social services activities of universities. Within the realm of teaching, it includes both the undergraduate level, and beyond that, graduate-level (or postgraduate level). The latter level of education is often referred to as graduate school, especially in North America. In addition to the skills that are specific to any particular degree, potential employers in any profession are looking for evidence of critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills, teamworking skills, information literacy, ethical judgment, decision-making skills, language skills, problem solving skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences.\u000aSince World War II, developed and many developing countries have increased the participation of the age group who mostly studies higher education from the elite rate, of up to 15 per cent, to the mass rate of 16 to 50 per cent. In many developed countries, participation in higher education has continued to increase towards universal or, what Trow later called, open access, where over half of the relevant age group participate in higher education. Higher education is important to national economies, both as an industry, in its own right, and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy. College educated workers have commanded a measurable wage premium and are much less likely to become unemployed than less educated workers. However, the admission of so many students of only average ability to higher education inevitably requires a decline in academic standards, facilitated by grade inflation. Also, the supply of graduates in many fields of study is exceeding the demand for their skills, which aggravates graduate unemployment, underemployment, credentialism and educational inflation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe U.S. system of higher education was heavily influenced by the Humboldtian model of higher education. Wilhelm von Humboldt's educational model goes beyond vocational training. In a letter to the Prussian king, he wrote:\u000a\u000aThere are undeniably certain kinds of knowledge that must be of a general nature and, more importantly, a certain cultivation of the mind and character that nobody can afford to be without. People obviously cannot be good craftworkers, merchants, soldiers or businessmen unless, regardless of their occupation, they are good, upstanding and \u2013 according to their condition \u2013 well-informed human beings and citizens. If this basis is laid through schooling, vocational skills are easily acquired later on, and a person is always free to move from one occupation to another, as so often happens in life.\u000a\u000aThe philosopher Julian Nida-Rümelin criticized discrepancies between Humboldt's ideals and the contemporary European education policy, which narrowly understands education as a preparation for the labor market, and argued that we need to decide between McKinsey and Humboldt.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Entrance standards: reading, mathematics, and writing ==\u000aDemonstrated ability in reading, mathematics, and writing, as typically measured in the United States by the SAT or similar tests such as the ACT, have often replaced colleges' individual entrance exams, and is often required for admission to higher education. There is some question as to whether advanced mathematical skills or talent are in fact necessary for fields such as history, English, philosophy, or art.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Types ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== General ===\u000aThe general higher education and training that takes place in a university, college, or Institute of technology usually includes significant theoretical and abstract elements, as well as applied aspects (although limited offerings of internships or SURF programs attempt to provide practical applications). In contrast, the vocational higher education and training that takes place at vocational universities and schools usually concentrates on practical applications, with very little theory.\u000aIn addition, professional-level education is always included within Higher Education, and usually in graduate schools since many postgraduate academic disciplines are both vocationally, professionally, and theoretically/research oriented, such as in the law, medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, and veterinary medicine. A basic requirement for entry into these graduate-level programs is almost always a bachelor's degree, although alternative means of obtaining entry into such programs may be available at some universities. Requirements for admission to such high-level graduate programs is extremely competitive, and admitted students are expected to perform well.\u000a\u000aWhen employers in any profession consider hiring a college graduate, they are looking for evidence of critical thinking, analytical reasoning skills, teamworking skills, information literacy, ethical judgment, decision-making skills, communication skills (using both text and speech), problem solving skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences. However, most employers consider the average graduate to be more or less deficient in all of these areas.\u000aIn the United States, there are large differences in wages and employment associated with different degrees. Medical doctors and lawyers are generally the highest paid workers, and have among the lowest unemployment rates. Among undergraduate fields of study, science, technology, engineering, math, and business generally offer the highest wages and best chances of employment, while education, communication, and liberal arts degrees generally offer lower wages and a lower likelihood of employment.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Liberal arts ====\u000a\u000aAcademic areas that are included within the liberal arts include environmental science, great books, history, languages including English, linguistics, literature, mathematics, music, philosophy, political science, psychology, religious studies, science, sociology and theater.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Engineering ====\u000a\u000aTeaching engineering is teaching the application of scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to design, build, maintain, and improve structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes. It may encompass using insights to conceive, model and scale an appropriate solution to a problem or objective. The discipline of engineering is extremely broad, and encompasses a range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of technology and types of application. Engineering disciplines include aerospace, biological, civil, chemical, computer, electrical, industrial, and mechanical.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Performing arts ====\u000a\u000aThe performing arts differ from the plastic arts or visual arts, insofar as the former uses the artist's own body, face and presence as a medium; the latter uses materials such as clay, metal or paint, which can be molded or transformed to create a work of art.\u000aPerforming arts institutions include circus schools, dance schools, drama schools and music schools.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Plastic or visual arts ====\u000a\u000aThe plastic arts or visual arts are a class of art forms, that involve the use of materials, that can be moulded or modulated in some way, often in three dimensions. Examples are painting, sculpture, and drawing.\u000aHigher educational institutions in these arts include film schools and art schools.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Vocational ===\u000a\u000aHigher vocational education and training takes place at the non-university tertiary level. Such education combines teaching of both practical skills and theoretical expertise. Higher education differs from other forms of post-secondary education such as that offered by institutions of vocational education, which are more colloquially known as trade schools. Higher vocational education might be contrasted with education in a usually broader scientific field, which might concentrate on theory and abstract conceptual knowledge.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Professional higher education ===\u000aThis describes a distinct form of higher education that offers a particularly intense integration with the world of work in all its aspects (including teaching, learning, research and governance) and at all levels of the overarching Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area. Its function is to diversify learning opportunities, enhance employability, offer qualifications and stimulate innovation, for the benefit of learners and society.\u000aThe intensity of integration with the world of work (which includes enterprise, civil society and the public sector) is manifested by a strong focus on application of learning. This approach involves combining phases of work and study, a concern for employability, cooperation with employers, the use of practice-relevant knowledge and use-inspired research.\u000aExamples of providers of professional higher education may include graduate colleges of architecture, business, journalism, law, library science, optometry, pharmacy, public policy, human medicine, professional engineering, podiatric medicine, scientific dentistry, K-12 education, and veterinary medicine.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Statistics ===\u000aA report titled 'Education at a Glance 2014' published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on 9 September 2014, revealed that by 2014, 84 percent of young people were completing upper secondary education over their lifetimes, in high-income countries. Tertiary-educated individuals were earning twice as much as median workers. In contrast to historical trends in education, young women were more likely to complete upper secondary education than young men. Additionally, access to education was expanding and growth in the number of people receiving university education was rising sharply. By 2014, close to 40 percent of people aged 25\u201334 (and around 25 percent of those aged 55\u201364), were being educated at university.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Recognition of studies ==\u000aThe Lisbon Recognition Convention stipulates that degrees and periods of study must be recognised in all of the Signatory Parties of the Convention.\u000a\u000a\u000a== As employers ==\u000a\u000aUniversities may employ a number of people. Depending on the funding, a university typically hires one teacher per 3\u201325 students. According to the ideal of research-university, the university teaching staff is actively involved in the research of the institution. In addition, the university usually also has dedicated research staff and a considerable support staff. Typically to work in higher education as a member of the academic faculty, a candidate must first obtain a doctorate in an academic field, although some lower teaching positions require only a master's degree.\u000aMost of the administrative staff works in different administrative sections, such as Student Affairs. In addition, there may be central support units, such as a university library which have a dedicated staff.\u000aThe professional field involving the collection, analysis, and reporting of higher education data is called institutional research. Professionals in this field can be found at locations in addition to universities, e.g. state educational departments.\u000aPost-secondary institutions also employ graduate students in various assistantship roles. In the US, close to 50% of graduate students are employed as graduate assistants at some point. These apprenticeship-like positions provide opportunities for students to gain experience in, and exposure to, professional roles in exchange for funding of their academic programs.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Recent controversy ==\u000aFrom the early 1950s to the present, more and more people in the United States have gone on to pursue degrees or certificates of higher education. However this has sparked some debate in recent years as some advocates say that a degree is not what it was once worth to employers. To clarify some advocates say that the financial costs that universities require from their students has gone up so dramatically that it is leaving many students in debt of loans of an average of $37,172 compared to 2000, where the average debt students graduated with was $16,928. In the United States there is an estimated 44 million Americans with a combined $1.3 trillion student loan debt.  Advocates advise parents to not send their children to college unless these children are committed to pursuing their future education. An increasing number of freshman every year drop out of their perspective programs or do not possess the maturity to have a balanced life away from home.\u000aHowever statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that the college educated are employed at a rate nearly twice that of the national average when compared to high school graduates. The type of degree one pursues will determine how safe and prosperous his/her career path is. A study published by the Pew Charitable Trusts, shows that among Americans ages 21 to 24, the drop in employment and income was much steeper among people who lacked a college degree. "Among those whose highest degree was a high school diploma, only 55% had jobs even before the downturn, and that fell to 47% after it. For young people with an associates degree, the employment rate fell from 64 to 57. Bachelor's degree slipped from 69 to 65." Professor Lisa Kahn of Yale stated that people who graduated from college in the most recent recession were in a position to gain better security than others.\u000aUltimately a survey, the Great Jobs and Great Lives Gallup-Purdue Index report found the type of college that students attend and in some cases even majors they choose have very little to do with their overall success and well-being later in life. What matters more, the index found, is feeling supported and making emotional connections during school.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aHigher education by country\u000aList of higher education associations and alliances\u000aGovernance in higher education\u000aGraduation\u000aHigher education accreditation\u000aHigher education bubble\u000aHigher education policy\u000aHigher Education Price Index\u000aInstitute\u000aUnCollege\u000aHochschule\u000aLeague of European Research Universities\u000aTechnical and Further Education (TAFE)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aBakvis, Herman and David M.

aVBenjamin Henry Jesse Francis Shepard (September 18, 1848 \u2013 May 29, 1927) was a composer, pianist, and writer who used the pen name of Francis Grierson.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life and spiritualism ==\u000aJesse was born in Birkenhead, England, to Joseph Shepard and Emily Grierson Shepard and his family migrated to Illinois, United States while he was still a baby. Shepard traveled in Europe, finding audiences even among royalty, and impressed the French novelist Alexandre Dumas, fils. He was involved with Spiritualism and stated that many of his musical performances were the result of the spirits of famous composers channeling through him. Shepard traveled through California in 1876 performing at several of the old religious missions founded by the Spanish. He was invited to live in San Diego by a pair of real-estate developers, the High brothers, who enticed him by promising to build a mansion to his specifications. The result was the Villa Montezuma (named after "The Montezuma", a migrant ship that first brought Shepard to America).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Tonner ==\u000a\u000aIn 1885, Shepard met Lawrence Waldemar Tonner, who became his friend and supporter for over 40 years. Tonner was born into the Danish Royal family in Thisted, Denmark on October 15, 1861. He emigrated to the U.S. through Glasgow, Scotland in 1870 and became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in 1875, in Chicago, Illinois. He worked as a manager, press secretary, interpreter, French teacher, and as a translator and aide for Herbert Hoover. Among the Waldemar Tonner Papers at ONE Archives, Los Angeles, is a letter recommending Tonner for a position with the Bureau of Public Information from Hoover, then head of the Food Administration. The letter was among Shepard's archived papers, which also included Tonner's credentials for the National Press Club of Washington, the Chevy-Chase Club and The University Club, Washington D.C., as well as Tonner's U.S. passport (issued in England by Robert Lincoln, son of the former president). Tonner died on May 25, 1947 in Los Angeles, California, and is buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.\u000a\u000a\u000a== San Diego to Europe to Los Angeles ==\u000a\u000aDespite his close association with Shepard, Tonner's name does not appear in the official documents by or about Shepard; for example, he is not listed in the San Diego City Directory as living at Villa Montezuma with Shepard. The two shared the home from July 1887 to the third quarter of 1888, before taking a mortgage out on the property to fund an initial trip to Paris for the publishing of Shepard's first book. They returned to San Diego in August 1889, and on finding the city's economic boom had ended, sold the home and its furnishings by mid-December before returning to Paris, where they lived until 1896.\u000aAfter Paris, Shepard and Tonner settled in London until 1913, when they decided to return to the United States. In 1920, they settled in Los Angeles, which remained home for the rest of their lives.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Final years and death ==\u000aAfter years of traveling the world together, Shepard lost his popularity and Tonner supported him. He taught French and worked in a tailoring shop. Shepard died in Los Angeles on May 29, 1927, immediately after playing the last chord of a piano performance entertaining friends who had invited him to dinner; he was still upright with his hands on the keys and it was Tonner who first noticed that something was wrong. Shepard's body was cremated.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Partial bibliography ==\u000a\u000aThe Valley of Shadows\u000aIllusions and Realities of the War\u000aThe Invincible Alliance and Other Essays (1913)\u000aParisian Portraits\u000aThe Humour of the Underman\u000aThe Valley of Shadows\u000aLa Vie et les hommes\u000aAbraham Lincoln, the Practical Mystic (1919)\u000aModern Mysticism (1899)\u000aThe Celtic Temperament (1901)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a\u000aThe Villa Montezuma at Haunted Houses.com\u000aFrancis Grierson: Beyond the Valley of Shadows to the halls of the Villa Montezuma\u000aWorks by Francis Grierson at Project Gutenberg\u000aWorks by or about Francis Grierson at Internet Archive

aVSigurd Manfred Raschèr (pronounced 'Rah-sher') (15 May 1907 \u2013 25 February 2001) was an American saxophonist of German birth. He became an important figure in the development of the 20th century repertoire for the classical saxophone.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aSigurd Raschèr was born in Elberfeld, Germany (now part of Wuppertal) where his father, Hans August Raschèr (1880\u20131952), was temporarily stationed as a military physician. His schooling began in Arlesheim, Switzerland and continued in Stuttgart where he graduated from the first Waldorfschule. After having played piano for some time, he decided to study clarinet with Philipp Dreisbach at the Hochschule für Musik in Stuttgart (1928/1929) In an interview, Raschèr said, "Obeying necessity, not following my inclination, I started to play saxophone in order to be in a dance band. As I did this for a couple of years, I became more and more unsatisfied. I started to practice furiously and slowly found out that it had more possibilities than was usually thought of."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career in Europe ==\u000aIn 1930 Raschèr moved to Berlin where he was called upon when a saxophonist was needed to perform in the Philharmonic. This is where he met the composer and conductor Edmund von Borck, who composed a concerto for him in 1931. Borck's Concerto, Op. 6 for Saxophone and Orchestra was chosen to be performed at the General German Composers Festival in Hanover, Germany on 3 October 1932. It was such a success that the Berlin Radio Orchestra, under the baton of Eugen Jochum, gave a performance with Raschèr in Berlin on 6 January 1933. In the summer of the same year, Raschèr performed the Borck concerto again in Strasbourg at Hermann Scherchen's International Musician's Working Conference, and in 1935 he performed it with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw under the baton on Eduard van Beinem.\u000aAs Hitler rose to power in 1933, Raschèr's friend, Johan Bentzon, whom he had met in Strasbourg, invited him to Copenhagen, Denmark, where Raschèr then taught at the Royal Danish Conservatory, 1934 also in Malmö, Sweden. Concert tours throughout Europe (e.g. Norway, Italy, Spain, Poland, England and Hungary etc.) with the exception of Germany, followed. In 1938 he visited Australia and in 1939 moved to the United States. \u000a\u000a\u000a== Career in the United States ==\u000aRaschèr arrived in the United States in 1939 and made his American debut with the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Serge Koussevitzky on 20 October 1939. On 11 November of the same year, he was a featured soloist in Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic under the baton of Sir John Barbirolli. He was the first saxophonist to appear as a soloist in a subscription concert with both orchestras\u000aHis career continued with solo appearances in Washington, D.C. and at New York City's Town Hall in the spring of 1940, which Toscanini attended and thereupon embraced Rascher. With war looming in Europe, he could not return to Germany. On 4 November 1941, his wife Ann Mari, of Swedish descent, joined him in the United States where they established their home on a small farm in the rural town of Shushan in northern New York, where they would reside for nearly 60 years.\u000aAlthough he was born in Germany, publicity from the 1940s often refers to Raschèr as having come from Sweden. This reflected both his distaste for the Hitler regime, and reaction to American suspicion during that time of all things German. His international career as a soloist and his ability to gain residence and citizenship in many countries could have been damaged or destroyed if any suspicion arose about his background.\u000aAfter World War II ended in 1945, Raschèr was invited to give concerts in Europe again, where he traveled for months on end, performing as soloist with many orchestras. As Raschèr's reputation grew in the United States, he also performed many orchestra concerts as soloist as well as with various university bands.\u000aRaschèr went on to perform as soloist with more than 250 orchestras and wind ensembles worldwide, including concerts in Europe, Asia, Australia, Canada and the United States.\u000aHis last saxophone solo performance was playing the Glazounov Concerto with the Vermont Symphony in 1977, on the eve of his 70th birthday. He died in Shushan, New York in 2001, aged 93.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Relationship with composers and premieres of major works ==\u000aDuring Raschèr's life, 208 works for saxophone were dedicated to him, many counted as among the most important 20th century works for the concert saxophone.\u000a"Throughout the middle decades of the twentieth century, a preponderance of the significant new saxophone solo and chamber repertoire would appear with the familiar dedication to Sigurd M. Raschèr, the outcome of not just his ongoing commitment to motivate some of the world's finest composers, but also in part the result of genuine close friendships he developed with so many. Among them were Larsson, Glaser, and von Koch in Sweden; Jacobi, Dressel,von Knorr and Hindemith in Germany; Haba, Macha, and Reiner in Czechoslovakia; and Benson, Brant, Cowell, Dahl, Erickson, Husa, and Hartley in the United States. And it is not without significance that among all the pieces written for and dedicated to him during his life, not one was commissioned. He inspired new music, he never needed to purchase it." --\u000aWorks dedicated to Raschèr include:\u000aEdmund von Borck: Konzert für Alt-Saxophon und Orchester, Op. 6, 1932\u000aWarren Benson: Concertino for Alto Saxophone and Wind Ensemble(or Orchestra, or Piano),1955\u000aHenry Brant: Concerto for Alto Saxophone and Orchestra, 1941\u000aEric Coates: Saxo-Rhapsody, 1936\u000aHenry Cowell: Air and Scherzo for Alto Saxophone and Small Orchestra(or Piano), 1961\u000aIngolf Dahl: Concerto for Alto Saxophone and Wind Ensemble, 1949\u000aWerner Wolf Glaser: Allegro, Cadenza e Adagio for Alto Saxophone and Piano, 1950\u000aAlexander Glazunov: Concerto pour Saxophone Alto avec l'Orchestre de Cordes in Eb Major,op.109, 1934\u000aAlois Hába: Suita pro Saxofon-Solo, Op.99, 1968\u000aWalter Hartley: Octet for Saxophones, 1975\u000aPaul Hindemith: Konzertstück für Zwei Altsaxophone, 1933\u000aAlan Hovhannes: World Under the Sea for Alto Saxophone, Harp, Tympani,Vibraphone and Gong, 1954\u000aKarel Husa: Elegie et Rondeau for Alto Saxophone and Piano, 1960\u000aJacques Ibert: Concertino da camera pour saxophone alto et onze instruments, 1935\u000aErland von Koch: Concerto for Alto Saxophone and Orchestra, 1959\u000aLars Erik Larsson: Konsert för Saxophon och Stråkorkester, 1934\u000aFrank Martin: Ballade for Alto Saxophone, String Orchestra, Piano and Tympani, 1938\u000aSlavko Osterc: Sonata for Alto Saxophone and Piano, 1935\u000aWilliam Grant Still: Romance for Alto Saxophone and Orchestra, 1954\u000aViktor Ullmann: Slavische Rhapsodie für Orchester und Saxophon, 1940\u000aMaurice Whitney: Introduction and Samba for Alto Saxophone and Band (Orchestra or Piano),1951\u000aCarl Anton Wirth: Idlewood Concerto, 1954\u000a\u000a\u000a== Raschèr Saxophone Quartet ==\u000aWith his daughter Carina, Linda Bangs and Bruce Weinberger, Rascher founded the Raschèr Saxophone Quartet in 1969, one of the first classical saxophone ensembles to perform world-wide. They appeared at major concert halls in Europe and the United States during the first ten years with Sigurd Rascher. The quartet was acclaimed as the "Uncrowned Kings of the Saxophone" (Wiener Zeitung). The Raschèr Quartet has performed in all countries of Europe, the United States, Mexico, Canada, South East Asia and Australia. It is the longest existing saxophone quartet and is entirely self-supporting. Raschèr's tireless pursuit of classical composers is continued by the quartet. Their impressive technical abilities and reputation led over 300 composers from more than 35 nations to dedicate works to the Raschèr Saxophone Quartet. The best known composers who have written for the group include Luciano Berio, Philip Glass, Iannis Xenakis, Sofia Gubaidulina, Charles Wuorinen, Giya Kancheli, Lera Auerbach, Pehr Henrik Nordgren, Miklos Maros, Mauricio Kagel, Cristobal Halffter etc.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Teaching career ==\u000aRaschèr taught saxophone at the Juilliard School, the Manhattan School of Music and the Eastman School of Music.\u000aMany of his students went on to become well known saxophone teachers and performers themselves, including:\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Raschèr Saxophone Workshops ===\u000aAfter retiring from his performing career in 1977, Raschèr continued to give week-long workshops to groups of saxophonists, both in the United States and his native Germany until well into his 80s. These workshops typically attracted between 40 and 80 players of all ages, and were usually held at universities where his admirers or former students held teaching positions, such as The University of Georgia (1976 &1977), The University of Southern Mississippi, Georgia State University, Union College, SUNY Fredonia, and Syracuse University.\u000aWorkshops featured master classes, performances by soloists and quartets, and a final concert featuring all attendees playing together as a "saxophone orchestra." The last U.S. workshop was held at Yale University in 1992 and the last European workshop was held in southern Germany in 1993.\u000aAfter suffering a debilitating stroke in 1994, Raschèr died in 2001 at age 93 in Shushan, New York.\u000aThe Sigurd Rascher Special Collections Archive is currently held at the State University of New York at Fredonia.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==\u000aOne subject that was of great importance to Raschèr was his tonal concept. He believed that when used in classical music, the saxophone should sound as its inventor, Adolphe Sax, had intended. Upon inventing the instrument, Sax had specified the shape of the interior of the instrument's mouthpiece as being large and round. All saxophone mouthpieces were made in this style until the 1940s, when the advent of big-band jazz made saxophonists experiment with different shapes of mouthpieces to get a louder and edgier sound.\u000aBetween 1940 and 1960, it became common for classical saxophonists to use narrow-chamber mouthpieces, which give the instrument a brighter and edgier sound. Whenever he taught or lectured to saxophone players, Raschèr emphasized that the modern mouthpieces were not what Sax had intended, and the sound they produce, while useful to a jazz player who requires a loud penetrating sound, was not appropriate for use in classical music. His students and other disciples felt that the desirable tone for a classical saxophone was a softer, rounder sound - a sound that can only be produced by a mouthpiece with a large, rounded interior (often referred to as an "excavated chamber"). His steadfast and irascible insistence in this area, while nearly all the world's classical saxophonists were moving to narrower mouthpieces (along with saxophones with a non-parabolically expanding bore) and a brighter tone, resulted in quarrels with, and alienation from, the majority of the classical saxophone world. There were other ways in which his playing differed from the majority of classical saxophonists; these included his insistence on using the slap tongue as a pizzicato technique, and his use of fluttertonguing.\u000aBy 1970, narrow-chambered mouthpieces had become nearly universally popular, and mouthpiece manufacturers ceased production of large-chambered mouthpieces. This lack of supply meant that Raschèr's students had difficulty finding mouthpieces that would produce the tone they desired. For a period of time the only large-chambered mouthpieces were ones that had been manufactured in the 1920s and 1930s, leading Raschèr students to search pawn shops and other sources of old instruments.\u000aRaschèr responded to this lack of supply by engaging a manufacturer to make a "Sigurd Raschèr brand" mouthpiece, which was simply a virtual duplication of the mouthpieces that had been readily available from American saxophone manufacturers Buescher, Conn and others in the 1920s. The Raschèr mouthpiece is still manufactured today.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Top tones ==\u000a\u000aOf special importance is Raschèr's emphasis on the extended range of the saxophone. As early as 1930 he demonstrated that an advanced player can achieve a range of four octaves on the saxophone, despite the fact that few players at that time ever played beyond the conventional range of two and a half octaves. This upper range became known as the "altissimo register," but Raschèr himself refused to use that term, preferring to call them "top tones."\u000aA few players played above high F before 1940, including H. Benne Henton of the Conway Band c. 1911 (to high D), Dick Stabile, an early jazz artist (to high F), and Jascha Gurewitz, an early recitalist (to high F#).\u000aRaschèr was vocal in encouraging composers to make use of this extended range. He was eager to demonstrate his command of these "top tones," and argued that the use of these tones was a legitimate musical technique, not a trick or novelty. His book on this subject, Top-Tones for the Saxophone, was published in 1941 and remains highly regarded to this day.\u000aTo better demonstrate that the technique of playing tones above high F had its basis in the natural overtone series of the saxophone, he had the Buescher factory create a custom instrument for him: a saxophone body with no tone holes at all. A picture of this instrument is seen on the inside page of the Top Tones book. He demonstrated that it was possible to play at least 16 overtones on this instrument, and on a conventional saxophone as well, and claimed that diligent study of the overtone technique was the best way to gain a command of the extended range and improve over all tone quality.\u000aThe extended range (altissimo register) was highly controversial throughout the middle of the 20th century, and Raschèr stirred the controversy among the classical saxophone community by insisting that the instrument's inventor, Adolphe Sax, had intended the instrument to be played in this manner. Raschèr cited evidence that Sax had demonstrated a three-octave range (up to a high C) to composers in the 1840s.\u000aDespite the initial resistance on the part of the saxophone community to the altissimo register, it has since come to be an accepted technique, and is utilized by nearly all classical and jazz saxophonists. Despite its difficulty, it is now commonly taught to advanced high school and college students, and has become a required skill for any student who desires a degree in saxophone performance.\u000a\u000aDuring the earlier decades of his career, many saxophonists resisted and even ridiculed his pioneering work in extending the upward range of the instrument beyond two and a half octaves. Composers, however, were more inclined to embrace this expanded expressive capability that Mr. Rascher had singularly fostered. By [1977], his lifelong commitment to the saxophone's high register, coupled with the momentum provided by so many composers who used it, had served to establish the extended range as an essential element of modern artistic saxophone performance.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Recognition and Awards ==\u000aHe was awarded the[Band Masters of America Award for distinguished artists\u000aHonorary Life Member of the North American Saxophone Alliance\u000aKappa Kappa Psi Distinguished Service to Music Medal\u000aHe received many other career awards (need details here).\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial web site [2] of the Raschèr Saxophone Quartet\u000aRaschèr's New York Times obituary\u000aRaschèr's Los Angeles Times obituary\u000aMemorial article about Raschèr at the Wayback Machine (archived 3 May 2005) by John-Edward Kelly\u000aSeveral articles by Sigurd Raschèr on saxophone history and usage at ClassicSax.com

aVInsurance in Serbia refers to the market for risk in the Republic of Serbia. Insurance, generally, is a contract in which the insurer (joint-stock insurance company, mutual insurance company, or reciprocal, for example), agrees to compensate or indemnify another party (the insured, the policyholder or a beneficiary) for specified loss or damage to a specified thing (e.g., an item, property or life) from certain perils or risks in exchange for a fee (the insurance premium).\u000aFor example, a property insurance company may agree to bear the risk that a particular piece of property (e.g., a car or a house) may suffer a specific type or types of damage or loss during a certain period of time in exchange for a fee from the policyholder who would otherwise be responsible for that damage or loss. That agreement takes the form of an insurance policy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aThe earliest traces are found in medieval Serbia, in Du\u0161an's Code. It is envisaged that the damage to property landlords compensate from the imperial treasury, and then the funds were restored from taxes.\u000aLater, the insurance developed in various forms, through the solidarity of members and their families in fraternities and Guild associations, or through forms of marine insurance. The first mention of insurance in Belgrade, was in 1839. year. The salesman, named Zuban, insured house and everything in it to a sum of 175 talers, in Trieste insurance company. Newspapers "Novine srbske" wrote in detail about the case, because after a few days Zubanova house burned to the ground, and full amount was paid to the owner.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Insurance companies ==\u000aAs of 2016, these are the largest companies in Serbian insurance market by premium income:\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==

aVBioArt is an art practice where humans work with live tissues, bacteria, living organisms, and life processes. Using scientific processes such as biotechnology (including technologies such as genetic engineering, tissue culture, and cloning) the artworks are produced in laboratories, galleries, or artists' studios. The scope of BioArt is considered by some artists to be strictly limited to "living forms", while other artists would include art that uses the imagery of contemporary medicine and biological research, or require that it address a controversy or blind spot posed by the very character of the life sciences.\u000aAlthough BioArtists work with living matter, there is some debate as to the stages at which matter can be considered to be alive or living. Creating living beings and practicing in the life sciences brings about ethical, social, and aesthetic inquiry. The phrase "BioArt" was coined by Eduardo Kac in 1997 in relation to his artwork Time Capsule. Although it originated at the end of the 20th century through the works of pioneers like Joe Davis Marta de Menezes and artists at SymbioticA, BioArt started to be more widely practiced in the beginning of the 21st century.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Overview ==\u000a\u000aBioArt is often intended to be shocking or humorous. One survey of the field in Isotope: A Journal of Literary Science and Nature Writing puts it this way: "BioArt is often ludicrous. It can be lumpy, gross, unsanitary, sometimes invisible, and tricky to keep still on the auction block. But at the same time, it does something very traditional that art is supposed to do: draw attention to the beautiful and grotesque details of nature that we might otherwise never see."\u000aWhile raising questions about the role of science in society, "most of these works tend toward social reflection, conveying political and societal criticism through the combination of artistic and scientific processes."\u000aWhile most people who practice BioArt are categorized as artists in this new media, they can also be seen as scientists, since the actual medium within a work pertains to molecular structures, and so forth. Because of this dual-acceptance, the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard University invites anyone to submit works based on scientific or artistic value. This can encourage anyone to submit work they strongly respond to.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Exposing artists to laboratories ==\u000aThe laboratory work can pose a challenge to the artist, at first, as the environment is often foreign to the artist. While some artists have prior scientific training, others must be trained to perform the procedures or work in tandem with scientists who can perform the tasks that are required. Bio artists often use formations relating to or engaged with science and scientific practices, such as working with bacteria or live-tissue.\u000aMuch of the art involves tissue-culturing and transgenics, a term for a variety of genetic engineering processes through which genetic material from one organism is altered by the addition of synthesized or transplanted genetic material from another organism.\u000aIn 2000, Eduardo Kac commissioned the creation of a transgenic GFP bunny as part of a piece called GFP Bunny. "The PR campaign included a picture of Kac holding a white rabbit and another, iconic image of a rabbit photographically enhanced to appear green."\u000aThe Tissue Culture & Art Project in collaboration with Stelarc grew a 1/4 scale replica of an ear using human cells. The project was carried out at SymbioticA: the Art & Science Collaborative Research Laboratory, School of Anatomy and Human Biology, University of Western Australia.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Art addressing topics in biology and society ==\u000a\u000aThe scope of the term BioArt is a subject of ongoing debate. The primary point of debate centers around whether BioArt must necessarily involve manipulation of biological material, as is the case in microbial art which by definition is made of microbes. A broader definition of the term would include work that addresses the social and ethical considerations of the biological sciences. Under these terms BioArt as a genre has many crossovers with fields such as critical or speculative design. This type of work often reaches a much broader general audience, and is focused on starting discussions in this space, rather than pioneering or even using specific biological practices. Examples in this space include Ray Fish shoes, which advertised shoes made and patterned with genetically engineered stingray skin, and BiteLabs, a biotech startup that attempted to make salami out of meat cultured from celebrity tissue samples. Among the artistic community, however, BioArt is increasingly restricted to disclude work that does not directly involve biological materials.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Controversy ==\u000aBioArt has been scrutinized for its apparent lack of ethics. USA Today reported that animal rights groups accused Kac and others of using animals unfairly for their own personal gain, and conservative groups question the use of transgenic technologies and tissue-culturing from a moral standpoint.\u000aAlka Chandna, a senior researcher with PETA in Norfolk, Virginia, has stated that using animals for the sake of art is no different from using animal fur for clothing material. "Transgenic manipulation of animals is just a continuum of using animals for human end, regardless of whether it is done to make some sort of sociopolitical critique. The suffering and exacerbation of stress on the animals is very problematic."\u000aHowever, many BioArt projects deal with the manipulation of cells and not whole organisms, such as Victimless Leather by SymbioticA. "An actualized possibility of wearing 'leather' without killing an animal is offered as a starting point for cultural discussion. Our intention is not to provide yet another consumer product, but rather to raise questions about our exploitation of other living beings." These projects were developed precisely to highlight and problematise our relationship to non-human animals and the use of animal products in scientific processes.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Practitioners ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aComputer art\u000aCyberarts\u000aDigital art\u000aElectronic art\u000aEnvironmental art\u000aEvolutionary art\u000aInternet art\u000aNeuroaesthetics\u000aNew Media art\u000aHybrid arts\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000aAnker, Suzanne, and Dorothy Nelkin.

aVOtto Krause (July 10, 1856 \u2013 February 14, 1920) was an Argentine engineer and educator.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aKrause was born in the Buenos Aires Province town of Chivilcoy to Leopoldina and Carl August Krause, both German Argentine immigrants arrived in 1851. Tending his farm with implements he brought from Germany, Carl Krause instilled an interest in machinery to his five children, though the family eventually relocated to Buenos Aires in 1870. Otto subsequently finished his secondary school studies at the prestigious Buenos Aires National College, a public college preparatory school.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Engineer and educator ==\u000aHe enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires School of Exact Sciences in 1874, though he enlisted in the Argentine Navy as an engineer's assistant later that year. He returned to civilian life in 1878 and obtained a degree in civil engineering, earning a post in the Buenos Aires Teachers' School. Krause then began a career in the Argentine railways, working in the planning department of the Buenos Aires Western Railway in 1879 and later contributing to the lines' extension into then-remote Tucumán and Salta Provinces.\u000aReturning to Buenos Aires in 1882, Krause held technical positions at the 11th of September Station, then the site of a large railyard. He continued to teach the discipline, and in 1887 was commissioned to select material in Europe for the new rail line and facilities to serve the recently founded city of La Plata. The experience earned him a post of technical director of the new mail train established by president Miguel Juárez Celman in 1888, and he became a tenured full professor at the University of Buenos Aires in 1891.\u000aAddressing the rapidly growing country's lack of formal technical schools, he established Argentina's first on March 15, 1897, and two years later, President Julio Roca re-chartered the institution as the National Industrial School, entitling it to public funds. Krause divided his time between the management of the school and diverse public posts, including that of President of the Municipal Tax Court and inspector of mines in the far-western San Juan Province. He continued to teach at his alma mater, as well, and in 1906 was named Dean of the School of Exact Sciences at the university. His efforts on behalf of technical schools included the 1909 inaugural of a new, important building for the National Industrial School in Buenos Aires' San Telmo area (just south of downtown), as well as the establishment of affiliates in La Plata, Rosario, Santa Fe and his hometown, Chivilcoy, among others.\u000aKrause helped plan irrigation works for the Río Negro valley in semi-arid Patagonia before retiring in 1911. He returned in advisory capacity to the University of Buenos Aires in 1919, but died the following February at age 63; the National Industrial School was subsequently renamed the Otto Krause Technical School.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Notes ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Bibliography ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aTodo Argentina - Biografias - Ingeniero Otto Krause (1856-1920) (accessed 2017-01-28)

He previously served as the Minister of Transport, Maritime and Communication almost continuously from 2002 to 2013 and again between 2015 and 2016. Between 2014 and 2015, he served as Senior Advisor to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\u000aY\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m served as the chairman of the board of Directors of \u0130stanbul Fast Ferries Company (\u0130DO) from 1994 to 2000 before being elected as an AKP Member of Parliament for \u0130stanbul's first electoral district during the 2002 general election. He was appointed as Minister of Transport by Prime Minister Abdullah Gül and continued in office after Erdo\u011fan became Prime Minister in 2003. As Transport Minister, he presided over numerous projects such as Marmaray, high-speed rail lines and an expansion in the country's airport and road facilities, though received heavy criticism and calls for his resignation following the Pamukova train derailment in 2004. In 2011, the portfolios of Maritime and Communications were merged with the Ministry of Transport, with Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m becoming the Minister of Transport, Maritime and Communication.\u000aLeaving office in a cabinet reshuffle in 2013, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m ran as the AKP candidate for Mayor of \u0130zmir in the 2014 local elections but lost to the incumbent Republican People's Party (CHP) candidate Aziz Kocao\u011flu. He was appointed as special advisor to Erdo\u011fan in June 2014 and left Parliament in the June 2015 general election due to the AKP's three-term rule for its sitting MPs. He was re-appointed as Transport Minister by Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu after being re-elected to Parliament in the November 2015 general election. Following Davuto\u011flu's resignation as party leader due to a breakdown in relations with President Erdo\u011fan on 5 May 2016, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was announced as the AKP's next leader by the party Central Executive Committee on 19 May and was elected unopposed during the party's 2nd Extraordinary Congress on 22 May 2016. He formed the country's 65th government and became Prime Minister on 24 May 2016. Factions of the Turkish Army in discontent with his policies attempted to oust him in a failed military coup d'état attempt on 15 July 2016.\u000aAs a staunch supporter of Erdo\u011fan, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m has been referred to as a 'low-profile' Prime Minister and is expected to spearhead a transition from a parliamentary system of government to an executive presidency, which will delegate greater powers to Erdo\u011fan and the office of the President. Following the declared victory of the 'Yes' vote in the 2017 constitutional referendum despite electoral irregularities, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m resigned as AKP leader in place of Erdo\u011fan, who was elected as his successor during the 3rd AKP extraordinary congress on 21 May 2017. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was subsequently elected as the AKP's parliamentary group leader by 300 votes on 24 May.\u000aIn 2013, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was implicated in a government corruption scandal, with the financial and social activities of his family members also coming under scrutiny. He has caused controversy over his defence of greater government surveillance and comments favouring sex segregation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life and career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Education ===\u000aBinali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was born in Refahiye, Erzincan Province, on 20 December 1955. His name, Binali, means son of Ali in Arabic (\u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a). An Alevi neighbour of his family gave him the name. His surname, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, means "lightning bolt" and has often been attributed by the pro-government press to embody the rapid growth of transport infrastructure during his tenure as Minister of Transport.\u000aY\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was educated at the \u0130stanbul Technical University's School of Maritime, studying Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering and later received his master's degree from the same department. While serving in numerous managerial positions in the General Directorate of the Turkish Shipping Industry and the Camialt\u0131 Shipyard, he received specialised training regarding Maritime Safety and Environmental Protection from the International Maritime Organisation's World Maritime University in Sweden. While at the World Maritime University, he spent six months working with maritime administration professionals at Scandinavian and European ports.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== \u0130stanbul Fast Ferries Director, 1994\u20132000 ===\u000aAfter graduation, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m served as the director general of the \u0130stanbul Fast Ferries Company (\u0130DO) from 1994 to 2000 while Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan was Mayor of \u0130stanbul. In attempts to make greater use of sea travel to ease transport congestion in \u0130stanbul, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m established the \u0130stanbul-Yalova and \u0130stanbul-Band\u0131rma ferry routes and oversaw the establishment of 29 ferry terminals, the commission of 22 passenger and 4 car ferries, making \u0130DO the largest commercial maritime transportation company of its time. In 1999, he was awarded a quality medal by the Skål International group for his contributions to the modernisation of the maritime transportation and tourism industries. He was removed from office by Erdo\u011fan's successor, Mayor Ali Müfit Gürtuna, following allegations of misconduct, having been accused of hiring out buffets to a firm run by members of his close family.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Early political career ===\u000aAs the Director of \u0130DO, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m established a close relationship to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who served as \u0130stanbul's Mayor from 1994 to 1998. When the latter led efforts to establish a new moderate conservative democratic political party in August 2001, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m joined Erdo\u011fan to become a founding member of the Justice and Development Party (AKP). He was subsequently fielded as a parliamentary candidate for \u0130stanbul's first electoral district in the 2002 general election and was elected following the party's landslide victory.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Member of Parliament ==\u000aElected as a Member of Parliament for \u0130stanbul's first electoral district in the 2002 general election, he was re-elected as an MP in the 2007 general election as a candidate from his home province of Erzincan. In 2006, he stated that his name was of Alevi origin and that he would work hard for the AKP to field Alevi candidates in the upcoming election, in response to criticism that the party was discriminating against the Alevi minority in Turkey due to its Sunni Islam political origin.\u000aIn the 2011 general election, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was elected for a third consecutive time from \u0130zmir's second electoral district. Due to the AKP's three-term limit on its MPs, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was unable to seek re-election for a fourth time in the June 2015 general election. However, he re-entered Parliament from \u0130zmir's first electoral district during the November 2015 snap general election seven months later.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Minister of Transport, Maritime, and Communication ==\u000a\u000aBinali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m has been referred to as the AKP's 'unchanging Transport Minister' due to his almost uninterrupted 11-year term in office. The only other non-independent AKP politician to hold the post before Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m became Prime Minister was Lütfi Elvan, who succeeded Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m in 2013 and served until 2015.\u000aY\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m served as the Minister of Transport between November 2002 and November 2011, leaving office three months before the 2007 general election and the 2011 general election in accordance to Article 114 of the Turkish constitution, which requires the vacation of the partisan Minister of Transport and his or her replacement by an independent minister three months before the end of a parliamentary term. In November 2011, the portfolios of maritime and communications were merged with the Transport Ministry, with Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m becoming the first Minister of Transport, Maritime and Communication. He left office during a cabinet reshuffle in 2013, but was reinstated as Minister by Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu on 24 November 2015.\u000aOn his personal website, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m has claimed that 17,500 kilometers of new motorways, 29 new airports and 1,213 kilometers of high-speed railway were constructed during his term as Minister.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Rail network expansion ===\u000a\u000aIn 2003, the government launched Turkey's first high-speed rail project, the H\u0131zland\u0131r\u0131lm\u0131\u015f tren ("Fast train"). On 4 January 2004, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m oversaw the launch of construction works on the first branch between Ankara and Eski\u015fehir, that was eventually inaugurated in 2009 with total costs of \u20ba7.5 million to upgrade the tracks, rolling stock and increase the speed of trains on the route to 150 km/h (93 mph). At the same time, work was completed to increase the average train speeds to 100 km/h (62 mph) throughout Turkey. In 2014, the line, operated by a subsidiary of the Turkish State Railways (TCDD), was extended to \u0130stanbul, completing the Ankara\u2013\u0130stanbul high-speed railway. Construction on the Ankara\u2013Konya high-speed railway began in 2006 and was completed in 2011.\u000aUnder the strategic aims published by the Transport Ministry while Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was in office, the government planned over 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) of high speed lines by the year 2023, as part of the AKP's '2023 vision' for the centenary of the Turkish Republic. The 'fast train' services were however met with criticism that the government had refused to listen to scientific concerns, with the project coming under heavy fire following the 2004 Pamukova train derailment despite Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's insistence that it would not be scrapped.\u000aIn addition to national rail infrastructure, several suburban and inner-city rail and metro systems were inaugurated by Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m. These included the \u0130stanbul Kabata\u015f\u2013Taksim funicular in 2006, both the \u0130zmir commuter rail (\u0130ZBAN) and the Adana Metro in May 2010, the \u0130stanbul Metro lines M3 in 2013, M4 in 2012 and M6 in 2015 and the Ankara Metro lines M3 and M4 in 2014. In 2013, the first phase of the Marmaray project, which links the continents of Europe and Asia via a tunnel under the Bosphorus in \u0130stanbul was opened, due to link and take over the entirety of the \u0130stanbul suburban rail services by 2018. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m also presided over extensions to the \u0130zmir Metro and \u0130stanbul Metro line M2, which was extended from \u015ei\u015fhane to Yenikap\u0131 via the Golden Horn Metro Bridge in 2014.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Aviation expansion ===\u000a\u000aY\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m presided over a new Transport Ministry initiative to vastly upgrade airports that were regarded to be in 'discarded condition'. Under the new scheme, numerous airports were closed for refurbishment. Following improvement work, the Tokat, Kahramanmara\u015f, Sivas, Gaziantep and Çanakkale airports were re-opened in 2006 while Bal\u0131kesir Airport and Kars Harakani Airport was reopened by Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m in 2007. A new international terminal at \u0130zmir Adnan Menderes Airport was opened in 2006, with Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m also present at the opening of a new domestic terminal in 2014. New terminal buildings for Erzincan Airport and Mardin Airport were both opened in 2011 and a new international terminal for Milas\u2013Bodrum Airport was completed in 2012. Major improvements to Bal\u0131kesir Koca Seyit Airport and Kastamonu Airport were completed in 2010 and 2013 respectively.\u000aNumerous new airports were constructed or completed construction while Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was Minister. Along with Zonguldak Airport and \u015eanl\u0131urfa GAP Airport, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m opened the controversial Hatay Airport in 2007. Amasya Merzifon Airport followed in 2008, while Gazipa\u015fa Airport serving Antalya and Gökçeada Airport serving Çanakkale were opened in 2010. Zafer Airport serving the cities of Afyonkarahisar, U\u015fak and Kütahya in 2012, I\u011fd\u0131r Airport also in 2012 and \u015e\u0131rnak Airport followed in 2013. Erhaç Airport in Malatya and Cengiz Topel Airport in Kocaeli, previously operating as military air bases, were opened to civilian air traffic in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was also involved in the construction of the Ordu-Giresun Airport, the third in the world to be built on an artificial island and the only one in Turkey and Europe, eventually opened on 22 May 2015. He was also involved in the initial phases of the Istanbul New Airport project to be opened in 2018, which is due to become the largest in the world.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Maritime projects ===\u000a\u000aOne of the most prevalent projects commissioned by the AKP government was the establishment of a new artificial waterway, running parallel to the Bosphorus and linking the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea. The project, named Kanal \u0130stanbul was described by former Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan as the party's 'crazy project', being one of the most prominent goals for the party's 2023 vision.\u000aThe government initially started discreet studies into the project's viability and possible routes, with Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m announcing plans in 2009. The project was officially inaugurated by Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in 2011. By 2016, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m announced that five possible routes for the project had been identified. However, he denied that the final route had been confirmed and warned investors to not engage in speculative asset purchases.\u000aIn addition to Kanal \u0130stanbul, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m also presided over various upgrades to the country's existing waterways and ferry services. \u0130zmir obtained new car and passenger ferries in 2013 and 2014, while a new ferry terminal was opened at Tuzla for \u0130DO ferry services to Yalova. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m also presided over privatisation of the state commercial ferry services, with the newspaper Yeni \u015eafak, although currently pro-government, alleging that Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m had given unlawful concessions to TAV Airports Holding in 2012 when the Holding was purchasing \u0130DO from the state. In 2015, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m announced plans to introduce positive discrimination for women mariners.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Government surveillance and censorship ===\u000a\u000aIn 2011, the portfolio of communications was officially added to Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's brief. As the Minister responsible for Transport, Maritime and Communication, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m oversaw significant government censorship of the Internet and greater government surveillance. In response to criticism of growing government surveillance, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m also caused controversy by responding 'If you are not up to anything illegal, don't worry about surveillance'.\u000aIn 2008, growing internet censorship resulted in blocks being implemented on YouTube and Blogger and approximately 1,000 other sites. A report commissioned by the British organisation Cyber-Rights.Org stated that 'the current Turkish law on controlling Internet content, through its procedural and substantive deficiencies, is designed to censor and silence political speech.' In response to criticism over Law 5651, which made it easier for the government to block websites, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m claimed that sites would continue to be blocked 'as they post content inappropriate for Turkish families'. In 2010, close to 44 IP addresses used by YouTube and Google were blocked, with the total number of blocked websites being estimated to be at 8,000. In July 2010, Turkey's first ever protest against internet censorship took place, with over 2,000 people demonstrating at Taksim Square in \u0130stanbul chanting slogans against Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m. Although Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m technically left office on 25 December 2013, he led efforts to generating court orders to block Twitter and YouTube due to a large-scale online anti-government backlash following revelations of government corruption in 2013.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Controversies ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 2004 Pamukova train derailment ===\u000a\u000aOn 22 July 2004, a fast train en route from Ankara to \u0130stanbul derailed after entering a curve too fast while passing through Pamukova, Sakarya Province. The train was one of the new 'fast trains' that ran on upgraded track and with new rolling stock brought in by Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and the AKP government as part of their 'faster trains' program. 41 people were killed while 80 were injured in the accident.\u000aY\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, as the Minister responsible for the 'faster trains' program, faced heavy criticism and calls for his resignation following the incident, with trade unions and non-governmental organisations blaming Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's dismissal of concerns raised by scientific experts about the safety of the new trains. It emerged that the Turkish State Railways (TCDD), which runs Turkey's train network, dismissed a call from scientists for the fast trains to be suspended during a meeting before the accident, where TCDD officials were allegedly warned that 'a future derailment would not come as a surprise'. Despite calls for his resignation, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m refused to resign and claimed that he was not a politician that would run away from crises, adding that the faster train program would continue. Trade Unions subsequently blamed the AKP of covering up the governmental mismanagement that caused of the incident and blaming the workers who constructed the track instead.\u000aFollowing the accident, it was uncovered that numerous senior officials from the TCDD had close relations to Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m. The General Director of the TCDD at the time, Süleyman Karaman, was said to have hailed from the same village as Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's family, while Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was also said to have been directly related to another TCDD executive board member, \u015eükrü Kutlu. Another board member, Talat Ayd\u0131n, was also alleged to be close to Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and concurrently served as a High Supervisory Board member at the Office of the Prime Minister.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Accusations of sex segregation ===\u000a\u000aA photograph of Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's veiled wife, Semiha Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, eating alone and sitting separately from him during a business lunch went viral and produced an outcry in Turkey in 2005, many criticising him with charges of sexism. The opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) claimed that it was an attempt by the Islamist-orientated AKP to construct a new social order, while numerous other non-governmental associations, universities and newspapers accused the Minister of supporting sex segregation. A statement released by Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m following the outcry claimed that Semiha Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m had sat alone at her own will.\u000aWhile attending the annual ball of his alma mater \u0130stanbul Technical University (\u0130TU) in 2013, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m explained that he had made his university choices with difficulty but claimed that he did not apply for Bo\u011faziçi University because he saw 'young men and women sitting together in the university garden' and that this would result in him 'going down the wrong path'. The comments were met with derision by Bo\u011faziçi students, who claimed that the comments were a product of 'authoritarian conservatism' and released a joint statement claiming that Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m 'should not fret, since he has already gone down the wrong path'.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Personal and family finances ===\u000a\u000aY\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's personal and family finances have continuously been criticised by the political opposition. In March 2014, Republican People's Party (CHP) deputy leader Sezgin Tanr\u0131kulu brought forward allegations that Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's son owned 30 ships, with both Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and his son being partial owners of numerous shipping companies around the world, some of which were also owned by businessmen that had been accused of corruption alongside Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m during the 2013 corruption scandal. Allegations regarding Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's son first emerged in 2003, when he allegedly obtained a loan from a shipping firm named Santour that had been leased a ferryboat by Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m as Transport Minister. It was further alleged that the firm was being funded by the state despite being a private company. In response to the scandal, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m issued a statement claiming that he had no interest or involvement in the matter and that the institution responsible was the Privatisation Administration, not the Ministry of Transport.\u000aY\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m has been identified by several investigative journalists to be the owner of 17 companies, 28 ships and 2 super-yachts, though the exact number of ships registered under his name remains unknown. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's son and daughter established their shipping company in 2002, purchasing their first ship in 2003 for $445,000 to operate the \u0130zmir Çe\u015fme-Brindisi (Italy) route. In response to criticism over how the money was acquired, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m claimed that he had partially paid for the ship himself and caused further controversy when he claimed that '$445,000 is not a lot of money'. On 7 January 2014 following a police raid on the Port Administration in \u0130zmir, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's brother-in-law was arrested for conspiring to rig bids on tender, defalcation, giving and taking bribes, serious fraud and sharing confidential information regarding tenders with others. He was also filmed and caught on camera while taking bribes.\u000aOn 12 April 2016, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's son was photographed by a Sözcü newspaper journalist playing roulette at the Marina Bay Sands Casino in Singapore. The photographs were leaked online, causing criticism due to Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's previous comments regarding religious morality and Islam, which conflicted with his son's gambling. It was alleged that the photographs were leaked by Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu in an attempt to halt a challenge by Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m for the party leadership. Soon after, photographs of Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's nephew, whom he had appointed to the \u0130stanbul Regional Directorate of Transport, were leaked showing him drinking rak\u0131, a traditional Turkish alcoholic beverage that also conflicted with the Islam-orientated social policy espoused by the AKP.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Veil controversy ===\u000a\u000aIn 2006, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was subject to criticism by secularists in Turkey over allegations that he preferred veiled women or men with veiled wives when appointing bureaucrats to positions within the Ministry of Transport. The criticism spread to the AKP government as a whole and to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan after Durmu\u015f Y\u0131lmaz, whose wife wore a headscarf, was appointed Governor of the Central Bank of Turkey. In response to the criticism, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m denied the claims of discrimination and stated that it was against the party's program, calling for a non-veiled candidate to come forward so that he could appoint her to 'any' bureaucratic position.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Claims regarding technology ===\u000aDespite being the Minister responsible for communications, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m gave a speech at a Türk Telekom event in 2011 and was ridiculed for his apparent lack of knowledge about Cloud computing. In his speech, he claimed 'there's this thing called the cloud system. Everyone throws something into it and people take what they need. This is how I understand it, maybe it's something different.' He also claimed that users would 'lose their minds' if they used it too often. A video of the speech re-emerged in 2016 shortly after he became Prime Minister, being compared to a speech given by Barack Obama promoting 'Take Your Child to the Lab' Week at the end of February 2016.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Later political career ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Special advisor to Erdo\u011fan, 2014\u201315 ===\u000aAfter leaving office as Transport Minister in 2013, he was appointed by the AKP as an advisor to the party leader, whom at that point was Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. When Erdo\u011fan was elected as the President of Turkey during the 2014 presidential election, he became a special advisor to the President despite being seen as a potential Prime Minister. With Ahmet Davuto\u011flu becoming Prime Minister, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m continued as an 'unofficial' advisor to Erdo\u011fan since officially being appointed to the Presidential Office required his resignation as an MP. Leaving Parliament in June 2015, he was officially appointed and continued as Presidential advisor until being re-elected as an MP in the November 2015 general election. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was frequently referred to by the press as Erdo\u011fan's closest and most loyal supporters.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== \u0130zmir mayoral candidacy ===\u000a\u000aIn the 2014 local elections, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was approached by Erdo\u011fan to run for the Metropolitan Mayor of \u0130zmir, regarded as a stronghold of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). Campaigning with the slogan '\u0130zmir'e \u0130yi bir Bakan Laz\u0131m', which could be translated both as '\u0130zmir needs a good Minister' or '\u0130zmir needs someone to look after it well', he set out 35 projects for \u0130zmir, co-inciding with \u0130zmir's license plate code, which is also 35. These included a tunnel and bridge linking the southern and northern banks of the Gulf of \u0130zmir.\u000aIn 2013, a dubious poll showed that Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was ahead of the CHP in \u0130zmir. Despite accusations of government electoral fraud and intentional power cuts designed to obstruct the counting process, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m lost the election and came second to the CHP candidate and incumbent Mayor Aziz Kocao\u011flu, who won 49.6% of the vote compared to Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's 35.9%. Following the election, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m praised the AKP's local gains in \u0130zmir where the party took 6 local mayoralties, stating that the local municipalities that had endorsed the AKP had said 'yes' to service and good governance. In 2016 following Ahmet Davuto\u011flu's resignation as Prime Minister, his mayoral rival and successful opponent Aziz Kocao\u011flu stated that he preferred Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m as Davuto\u011flu's successor due to his ties with \u0130zmir.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Potential AKP leadership bids ===\u000aY\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was frequently observed as a potential contender for the Justice and Development Party leadership during Davuto\u011flu's premiership, especially at times when the relationship between Davuto\u011flu and Erdo\u011fan appeared to be faltering. The most serious challenge from Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m came during the AKP Ordinary Congress held in September 2015, where an apparent disagreement between Davuto\u011flu and Erdo\u011fan over the central executive committee candidate lists caused Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m to begin collecting delegate signatures for a potential leadership bid. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m stopped collecting signatures at the last minute when a deal between Davuto\u011flu and Erdo\u011fan was reached.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Prime Minister, 2016\u2013present ==\u000aHaving been identified as one of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan's most loyal supporters, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m has been referred to as a 'low-profile' Prime Minister even by members of his own party, working only towards the goal of abolishing the parliamentary system of government and bringing about an executive presidency that would allow Erdo\u011fan to consolidate his powers and effectively abolish the Office of the Prime Minister.\u000aY\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m has been described as a 'technocrat' with unwavering loyalty to Erdo\u011fan, in contrast to Davuto\u011flu who had been internationally known for his foreign policy vision. As a result, he is expected to act as a 'secretary' to the President as opposed to Davuto\u011flu's perceivably more independent premiership. In his candidate speech at the 2016 AKP Congress, he emphasised the need to 'legally enforce the de facto situation' by establishing an executive presidency and writing a new constitution, implying that Erdo\u011fan, despite being required by the constitution to be politically neutral, already was effectively the de facto executive president of Turkey. following Davuto\u011flu's resignation, AKP Member of Parliament Ayd\u0131n Ünal stated that the next Prime Minister would focus on technical implementation only with Erdo\u011fan dictating government policy.\u000aUnveiling his cabinet ministers, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's government was noted for consisting entirely of Erdo\u011fan-loyalist ministers and immediately earned the nickname 'Presidential Cabinet' from political analysts in Ankara. It was reported that Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m had prepared the cabinet list with Erdo\u011fan on 23 May, a day before his government was ratified, with pro-Erdo\u011fan politicians such as Nurettin Canikli and Nihat Zeybekci returning to the cabinet having been left out by Ahmet Davuto\u011flu. The cabinet was described as 'compliant' and as one that would 'take decisions quickly and completely focused on policy implementation.' His government won the vote of confidence of Parliament on 29 May, with 315 votes in favour to 138 against.\u000aY\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m is the first Prime Minister in 20 years to come from an engineering background. The previous Prime Minister to have originated from a background in engineering was Necmettin Erbakan, who served as Prime Minister from 1996 to 1997.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Resignation of Ahmet Davuto\u011flu ===\u000a\u000aOn 5 May 2016, Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu announced that he would be stepping down as AKP leader and would not stand as a candidate in the subsequent party leadership election. The announcement came after several days of speculation that relations between Davuto\u011flu and Erdo\u011fan had declined significantly over the latter's insistence of an executive presidency system of government that would have seen Davuto\u011flu's office effectively abolished. In April 2016, a WordPress blog named the Pelican files were released by unnamed supporters of Erdo\u011fan, detailing 27 different points of disagreement between the two men. These included Davuto\u011flu's domestic and foreign policies, disagreements over the AKP's election candidate lists for the June 2015 general election and concerns that Davuto\u011flu was attempting to establish his own support base in rival to Erdo\u011fan. A similar disagreement between Erdo\u011fan and Davuto\u011flu regarding the unified candidate list for the party Central Executive Committee during the 5th AKP Ordinary Congress in 2015 almost prompted Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m to run against him.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Election as AKP leader ===\u000a\u000aFollowing the announcement of Davuto\u011flu's resignation, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m emerged as the frontrunner in the field of potential successors, which included Erdo\u011fan's nephew and Energy Minister Berat Albayrak amongst other senior AKP politicians known for their loyalty to Erdo\u011fan. On 16 May, 353 AKP provincial, district, youth and women's wing representatives were invited to the party headquarters to conduct an internal poll on their preferred next leader, with Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m topping the preferences of the 315 representatives attending. On 17 May, a similar poll was conducted with the AKP's parliamentary group. Despite the internal party opinion polling, President Erdo\u011fan was observed to have effectively hand-picked Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m to succeed Davuto\u011flu due to him being a close ally for two decades.\u000aOn 19 May 2016, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was announced as the sole candidate for the Justice and Development Party leadership by the party Central Executive Committee (MKYK). He was elected as leader unopposed during the party's 2nd Extraordinary Congress on 22 May 2016, winning 1,405 of the 1,411 votes (with the remaining 6 being declared invalid or blank). A new Central Executive Board was elected alongside the party leader, with numerous senior AKP politicians, some of which had been seen as potential leadership candidates alongside Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, being left off the unified list.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Executive Presidency and new constitution ===\u000aDelivering a statement on his government's program shortly after being appointed as Prime Minister on 24 May 2016, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m set out the main goals of his government to abolish the parliamentary system and bring about an executive presidency, which would require 330 of 550 votes in Parliament to hold a referendum or 367 votes to enact directly without the need for a referendum. This confirmed wide speculation that Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m would not act as a head of government independent from the Presidency, but as a loyalist to President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan with the intention of using the powers of Prime Minister to boost Erdo\u011fan's powers as President and potentially result in the abolition of his own office of Prime Minister. Soon after becoming Prime Minister, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m claimed that the fact that the President was now elected by popular vote rather than by Parliament had created a power struggle and confusion amongst the population, resulting in the need for a transition to an executive presidency.\u000aDuring his first speech to the AKP parliamentary group since becoming Prime Minister, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m announced that his government would begin work on drafting a new constitution with a matter of urgency, claiming that the current Constitution of Turkey, which was written during the 1980 coup d'état, was outdated for the AKP's 2023 vision for the centenary of the establishment of the Turkish Republic. He called on opposition parties to start working together again with the AKP to write a joint constitution, with the all-party constitutional commission having been abandoned by the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) under Davuto\u011flu's premiership over disagreements regarding the presidential system.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Economic policy ===\u000a\u000aFollowing economic uncertainty due to the unstable political situation in Turkey as well as a bleak economic outlook for the Eurozone, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m delegated the government's economic policy to Ministers who were well known and trusted by the financial sector. In contrast to predictions that they would be left out of the cabinet, Mehmet \u015eim\u015fek was re-appointed Deputy Prime Minister responsible for the economy while Naci A\u011fbal remained as Minister of Finance amid reports that the position would be given to Erdo\u011fan's son-in-law Berat Albayrak. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was succeeded by Ahmet Arslan as the Minister of Transport, Maritime and Communication, which was seen as a sign that the new government would prioritise investment on transport infrastructure due to Arslan's participation in previous transport projects such as Marmaray. Erdo\u011fan loyalist Nihat Zeybekci was re-appointed Minister of the Economy, having been known to share interest rate policies similar to those of Erdo\u011fan. Numerous economic responsibilities of Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet \u015eim\u015fek were delegated to co-deputy Prime Minister Nurettin Canikli or to Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m himself.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Foreign policy ===\u000aShortly after taking office as Prime Minister, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m gave an overview of the foreign policy that his government would follow. He claimed that regional problems increased the importance of Turkey as a regional power, further claiming that he would follow the 'simple' foreign policy goal of increasing the number of allies and decreasing the number of enemies in the region. His speech was seen as a reference to the increasing isolation of Turkey on the world stage and the growing hostility of other countries towards the AKP government. Commentators claimed that Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m could pursue a 'revisionist' foreign policy with the consent of Erdo\u011fan, departing from the previous foreign policy ideals of the AKP, in an attempt to end both Turkey's international isolation and domestic problems caused by the AKP's responses to events such as the Syrian Civil War.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== European Union ====\u000a\u000aFollowing Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's election as AKP leader on 22 May, the European Union released a statement on 23 May congratulating him and calling for the new government to work towards implementing the migrant deal agreed on 18 March. On 25 May 2016, he claimed that Turkey was meeting all the standards for EU membership, but was being met by a "cyclical rapprochement" and a "negative discriminatory process". He called on the EU to end the 'double standards' shown against Turkey,\u000aIn response to deadlock in reaching a deal with the EU regarding the European migrant crisis, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m called on the EU to keep its promise to grant Turkish citizens access to member countries without a visa as was initially agreed. The EU declared that Turkey would have to change its terror laws for the deal to take place despite the initial agreement, a condition met with strong opposition by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Referring to the fight against terrorism, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's new minister for EU affairs Ömer Çelik once again criticized the EU's "double standards" and warned that Turkey's relations with the EU were very important, but not the country's "sole option". Foreign minister Mevlüt Çavu\u015fo\u011flu doubled down on Turkey not being "bluffing" or uttering "threats" when it says it could suspend all agreements signed with the EU, including the readmission agreement.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Germany genocide recognition ====\u000a\u000aOn 2 June 2016, the German Bundestag voted in favour of a motion jointly proposed by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Green Party that officially recognised the events concerning the mass deportation and killings of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire in 1915 as a Genocide, in line with a similar decision taken by the European Parliament a year before. Prior to the decision, Prime Minister Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m claimed that he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Germany would be undergoing a 'friendship test with Turkey' during the vote and that such a decision would be irrational and detrimental to relations between the two countries.\u000aIn response, the government enacted similar measures that had been taken against the previous 29 countries that had recognised the Armenian Genocide, beginning with the recalling of the Turkish Ambassador in Berlin back to Turkey (though presumably on a temporary basis). The German Ambassador to Turkey was also summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be presented with a letter of strong condemnation that refused to recognise the decision in line with Turkey's claim that only historians should have a say on historical events, not parliamentarians. It was also expected that Germany would enter Turkey's 'red list' of states that they would not follow close partnerships with, especially in the fields of defence and industry on a temporary basis.\u000aIn response to the German Parliament's decision, Prime Minister Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m made a statement criticising Germany and claiming that there was no past historical event that the Turkish people are ashamed of. He also called the decision 'faulty' and reiterated that Turkey would not accept its legitimacy. Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmu\u015f branded the actions of the German Parliament as 'distorted and baseless', calling it a 'historical mistake.' and warning that it was not compliant with Turkey-Germany relations. In response, Merkel reiterated that the relations between Germany and Turkey remained strong.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Russia ====\u000aAs part of the new government's program, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m announced plans to keep open channels for mutual dialogue with Russia in an attempt to normalise relations on the basis of common interests. Turkish relations with Russia deteriorated sharply in November 2015 after Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet claiming that it had violated Turkish Airspace. The deterioration in relations also caused economic and trade relations between the two countries to decline. It was expected that 'normalisation' of economic relations with Russia would be one of the most important responsibilities of the new government.\u000aIn response to the appointment of Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m as Prime Minister, the Deputy President of the Federation Council Foreign Policy Committee Vladimir Cabarov claimed that a new Prime Minister would not result in any changes to Turkey-Russia relations, claiming that Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan was effectively the main policy-maker in Turkey and that his past actions had 'burnt all bridges' with Russia. He also referred to Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's close relations with Erdo\u011fan and claimed that any attempts to reconcile with Russia would not be initiated at Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's own accord.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Coup attempt ===\u000aOn July 15, 2016, the military staged a coup that attempted to overthrow the Turkish government but it failed.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aY\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m is married to retired teacher Semiha Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m since 1976 and has three children, Erkan, Ahmet and Bü\u015fra. A primary school established by their three children in Çekmeköy, \u0130stanbul was named after his wife, 'Ö\u011fretmen Semiha Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m \u0130lkokulu', and was opened on 24 November 2012. Semiha Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m is also active in the Justice and Development Party, having been seen at the establishment of the government's 'Soul Mountain' (Gönül Da\u011f\u0131) Project on 17 May 2016 sitting next to President Erdo\u011fan's wife Emine Erdo\u011fan.

aVRAF Lympne  was a Royal Air Force station used during the First and Second World Wars. It opened in 1916 by the Royal Flying Corps as an acceptance point for aircraft being delivered to, and returned from, France. It was later designated as a First Class Landing Ground. In 1919, the airfield was turned over to civil use as Lympne Airport, serving until 1939 when it was requisitioned by the Fleet Air Arm as HMS Buzzard, later being renamed HMS Daedalus II.\u000aIn 1940, it was taken over by the Royal Air Force, becoming RAF Lympne once again. Lympne was heavily bombed during the Battle of Britain, putting the base out of action for a number of weeks. It was to have been the landing point for a German aircraft in a plot to kidnap Adolf Hitler involving the defection of pilot Hans Baur. Preparations were made by the Royal Air Force for his arrival. Later in the war, Lympne was used as an Emergency Landing Ground for bombers returning from raids in Europe. In 1946, RAF Lympne closed, returning to use as a civil airport which continued until 1984.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== First World War ===\u000aWork began on creating a landing ground at Folks Wood, Lympne in the autumn of 1915. This site soon proved unsuitable and another site was sought. Lympne was established in March 1916 as an Emergency Landing Ground for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) home defence fighters defending London against Zeppelins and Gotha bombers. By October 1916 Bessonneau hangars and other technical buildings had been erected and Lympne Castle was being used as an officers mess and No. 1 Advanced School of Air Gunnery operated from Lympne during January and February 1917. In January 1917 it was designated as No. 8 Aircraft Acceptance Park for delivery of aircraft to, and reception from, France. A spur to Westenhanger railway station allowed delivery of aircraft for final assembly at Lympne and three pairs of permanent hangars were erected to enable aircraft assembly. A variety of aircraft were passed through Lympne including Handley Page O/100 and Handley Page O/400 bombers.\u000aOn 25 May 1917 Lympne was bombed by Gotha G.IV bombers of Kagohl 3 who dropped 19 bombs on the airfield. In August 1917 questions were asked in Parliament by Peter Kerr-Smiley about the lack of leave for RFC Lympne pilots who had not had any in over a year. Under-Secretary of State for War Ian Macpherson stated that the pilots would be allowed leave when conditions allowed. No. 69 Squadron RAF arrived on 24 August equipped with the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 and departed on 9 September.\u000aIn 1918 Lympne was a First Class Landing Ground and used by Sopwith Camels of No. 50 Squadron RFC (Home Defence Squadron) and in January 1918 No. 120 Squadron RFC (Bomber Squadron) was formed at Lympne. On 1 March No. 98 Squadron RFC arrived equipped with Airco DH.9 bomber aircraft, departing on 1 April. The Day and Night Bombing Observation School was formed here in May.\u000aOn 16 February 1919 a cadre of No. 108 Squadron RAF arrived followed by a cadre of No. 102 Squadron RAF on 26 March\u2014Both squadrons departed on 3 July. On 17 July No. 120 Squadron returned and flew air mail services between Lympne and Cologne, Germany, during July and August 1919 using DH.9 aircraft fitted with B.H.P. (Beardmore Halford Pullinger) engines. This service ended on 1 September 1919 when 120 squadron moved to Hawkinge. Hawkinge and Lympne lay within a few miles of each other and the Air Ministry could not justify keeping the two bases open following the end of the war; Hawkinge was the one retained. In August 1919, the Royal Air Force (RAF) \u2013 as the RFC had by then become, moved out of Lympne, and it was turned over to civilian use, although 120 Squadron did not depart until 21 October.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Between the wars ===\u000a\u000aBetween the wars, the airport was used for annual camps by squadrons of the Auxiliary Air Force. On 1 August 1931, No. 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF began its annual camp at Lympne. In August 1933, No. 601 (County of London) Squadron again held its annual camp at Lympne. They were visited by the Marquess of Londonderry, who was the Secretary of State for Air. The squadron was equipped with Hawker Harts. From 13 to 27 July 1934, 606 (City of Glasgow) Squadron AuxAF held its annual camp at Lympne, followed by 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF from 29 July to 12 August. In August 1935, 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF held its annual camp at Lympne. The squadron having converted from a bomber squadron to a fighter squadron earlier in the year. From 2 to 16 August 1936, 601 Squadron held their annual camp at Lympne.\u000aIn November, it was reported that 21 Squadron and 34 Squadron were temporarily relocated to Lympne as hangars at RAF Abbotsinch had been damaged in gales. In October 1936, Lympne was again taken over by the RAF, becoming a base within No. 1 (Bomber) Group. Although some improvements were carried out, Lympne was initially seen as a temporary station. On 3 November, 21 Squadron and 34 Squadron moved in, equipped with Hawker Hind aircraft. On 12 July 1938, 34 Squadron departed Lympne followed by 21 Squadron departing on 15 August. Lympne was placed under "Care and Maintenance" in October 1938, becoming a Training Command Administration School. In May 1939, Lympne was transferred to Fighter Command. It was used by the Fleet Air Arm as an outstation for the Air Mechanics School based at HMS Daedalus near Portsmouth.  On 1 July 1939, Lympne was taken over by the Fleet Air Arm, becoming HMS Buzzard. Aircraft at Buzzard included Blackburn Sharks and Gloster Gladiators.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Second World War ===\u000a\u000aIn September 1939, the base was renamed HMS Daedalus II, but was transferred back to the RAF in May 1940. Early in the war Lympne was home to Army Co-operation and Bomber squadrons. From 19 to 22 May 1940, 2 Squadron, 16 Squadron, 18 Squadron, 23 Squadron, 53 Squadron and 59 Squadron moved in. Nos 2, 16 and 26 Squadrons were equipped with Westland Lysander aircraft. The Lysanders or 16 Squadron and 26 Squadron were used on Black Violet missions, in support of the remaining British troops following the Battle of France. Nos 18, 53 and 59 Squadrons were equipped with Bristol Blenheims. The Blenheim squadrons departed Lympne on 21 May after a stay of just two or three days. On 23 May, Lympne became the HQ of 51 Wing. During Operation Dynamo in May 1940, a French Air Force squadron with its Bloch and Potez fighters was based at Lympne.\u000aOn 3 June, 16 Squadron left Lympne, followed by 2 and 26 Squadrons on 8 June, at which date Lympne ceased to be the HQ of 51 Wing. During the Battle of Britain Lympne was a satellite airfield for the stations of 11 Group, being used as a forward stage for flights and not the base for any squadron. On 15 August 1940 during the Battle of Britain, Lympne was bombed by Stuka dive-bombers of II Gruppe, StG1. All the hangars were hit and those aircraft belonging to Cinque Ports Flying Club that had not been evacuated to Sywell were destroyed in the fire. Lympne was evacuated and only available as an Emergency Landing Ground until mid-September, when a flight of Spitfires from 91 Squadron arrived.\u000aIn 1941, Lympne was to be the destination for the landing of an aircraft carrying Adolf Hitler in a daring kidnap plot. A man by the name of Kiroff had given information to the British Military Attaché in Sofia, Bulgaria that he was the brother-in-law of Hans Baur, the personal pilot of Hitler. He stated that Baur was planning to defect using Hitler's aircraft, a Focke-Wulf Fw 200, with him on board. The RAF made plans to receive the aircraft at Lympne and 25 March was the date that the defection was expected to occur. Baur did not defect, spending the war as Hitler's personal pilot. Also in March 1941, 91 Squadron moved in, equipped with Spitfires. Additional dispersals and fighter pens were built and three new blister hangars were built during 1941.\u000aTyphoons from 1 Squadron were based at Lympne from March 1942 to February 1944 to counter the thread posed by the Luftwaffe's newly introduced Focke-Wulf Fw 190s. A runway was extended across Otterpool Lane to accommodate the Typhoons.\u000aIn May 1942, Whirlwinds of 137 Squadron were detached from RAF Manston. On 30 June 1942, 72 Squadron and 133 Squadron moved in, equipped with Spitfires. Both squadrons departed on 12 July, but 133 Squadron returned on 17 August for five days. On 14 August, Spitfire-equipped 401 (RCAF) Squadron moved in, both in preparation for the Dieppe Raid. On 2 October, 65 Squadron moved in, equipped with Spitfires. The squadron left Lympne on 11 October.\u000aOn 15 March 1943, 1 Squadron moved in, equipped with Typhoons. A detachment from 245 Squadron also arrived that month, also equipped with Typhoons. The detachment remained at Lympne until May. In June, the detachment from 137 Squadron ended. In On 18 August, 609 Squadron move in, equipped with Typhoons, staying until 14 December. 609 squadron operated missions in preparation for D-Day, participating in attacks against "Doodlebug" launch sites in the Pas de Calais. The squadron included the only German to fly for the RAF, Ken Adam. In December 1943, rocket armed Hawker Hurricanes of 137 Squadron were at Lympne for anti-shipping duties.\u000a\u000aIn January 1944, 609 squadron was re-equipped with Typhoons. On 15 February, 1 Squadron departed. On 1 March, 186 Squadron arrived, followed by 130 Squadron on 5 April, which was the day 186 Squadron departed. At some point after 2 April 137 Squadron departed. On 15 May, 74 Squadron arrived, followed by 127 Squadron the following day. On 1 July, 310 squadron arrived. On 3 July, Lympne became the HQ of 134 (Czech) Wing, that day also saw the departure of 74 Squadron. It was followed by the arrival of 312 Squadron and 313 Squadron on 4 July. These squadrons were all equipped with Spitfires. Also on 4 July 127 Squadron departed. On 11 July 310, 313 and 313 Squadrons departed. They were replaced by 1 Squadron, which was now equipped with Spitfires, 41 Squadron, 130 Squadron, and 504 Squadron, also equipped with Spitfires. On 12 July 504 Squadron departed, being replaced by 165 Squadron. On 10 August, 1 Squadron and 165 Squadron departed. The next day, 130 Squadron returned. On 8 September, 403 Squadron (RCAF) equipped with Spitfire IXs arrived in support of D-Day. On 27 August, Lympne ceased to be the HQ of 134 (Czech) Wing. On 29 September, 350 (Belgian) Squadron arrived, equipped with Spitfire XIVs. They were followed on 12 September by 610 Squadron and 350 Squadron on 29 September. The next day, 130 Squadron departed. In November, a detachment from 567 Squadron arrived. On 3 December 350 Squadron departed, followed by 610 Squadron the next day and 41 Squadron the day after that. Lympne was then downgraded to Emergency Landing Ground status. Consideration was given to building four runways at Lympne, with the longest being 6,000 ft (1,800 m) long, but it was noted that serious demolition work would be required and a number of roads would need to be closed.\u000aIn March 1945, a detachment from 598 Squadron arrived, departing the following month. This was followed by the arrival 451 Squadron and 453 Squadron on 6 April, equipped with Spitfires. On 2 May 453 squadron departed, followed by 451 Squadron the following day. The detachment from 567 Squadron departed in June. On 1 January 1946, RAF Lympne was handed over to the Ministry of Civil Aviation and became a civil airport once more, serving until closure in 1984.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Accidents and incidents ==\u000a\u000aOn 23 May 1940, Armstrong Whitworth Ensign G-ADTA Euryalus of British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) crash-landed at RAF Lympne and was damaged. The aircraft was one of six that escaped after a Luftwaffe raid on Merville Airfield, France. The intended destination was Croydon. Approaching the English coast, anti-aircraft fire was encountered, first she lost her port inner engine and the pilot set course for RAF Hawkinge. A short time later her starboard inner engine also had to be shut down. The pilot changed course for Lympne. On landing, the starboard undercarriage was not fully down, causing the wing to scrape the ground and the aircraft to go through a fence as no braking was attempted. Euryalus was flown to RAF Hamble in June, but it was decided to cannibalise her to repair G-ADSU Euterpe which had been damaged in an accident at Bonnington??? on 15 December 1939. Euryalus was officially written off on 15 November 1941 and scrapped in September 1942.\u000aOn 24 February 1944, Consolidated B-24 Liberator serial 41-29231 Impatient Virgin crash landed at Lympne following battle damage sustained in a raid on Fürth, Germany. Eight of the ten crew bailed out and deployed their parachutes before the aircraft landed, with one of them being injured on landing.\u000aIn February 1944, a Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress of the 379th Bombardment Group, United States Army Air Forces landed at Lympne following battle damage which included the complete loss of its port outer engine.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Squadrons and units using Lympne ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of former Royal Air Force stations\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aNotes\u000a\u000aCitations\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sources ==\u000aCollyer, David G (1992).

aVThomas Shotter Boys (1803\u20131874) was an English watercolour painter and lithographer.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aBoys was born at Pentonville, London, on 2 January 1803. He was articled to the engraver George Cooke. When his apprenticeship came to an end he went to Paris where he met and came under the influence of Richard Parkes Bonington, who persuaded him to abandon engraving for painting. Some sources describe him as a pupil of Bonington, although William Callow, who later shared a studio with him in Paris, disputed this.\u000aHe exhibited at the Royal Academy for the first time in 1824, and in Paris in 1827. In 1830 he went to Brussels, but returned to England on the outbreak of the revolution there. Paying another visit to Paris, he remained there until 1837, and then returned to England in order to lithograph the works of David Roberts and Clarkson Stanfield.\u000aHis most important work, Picturesque Architecture in Paris, Ghent, Antwerp, Rouen, etc., a collection of colour lithographs, appeared in 1839, attracting a great deal of admiration. Drawn on the stone by Boys and printed by Charles Joseph Hullmandel, it was described in a review in the Polytechnic Journal as "the first successful effort in chroma-lithography  [sic] hitherto brought to perfection". King Louis-Philippe sent the artist a ring in recognition of its merits. He also published Original Views of London as it is, drawn and lithographed by himself, (London, 1843). He drew the illustrations to Blackie's History of England, and etched some plates for John Ruskin's Stones of Venice.\u000aBoys was a member of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours, and of several foreign artistic societies. He died in 1874.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVMarino (Marinum or Castrimoenium in Latin, Marini in local dialect) is an Italian city and comune in Lazio (central Italy), on the Alban Hills, Italy, 21 kilometres (13 miles) southeast of Rome, with a population of 37,684 and a territory of 26.10 square kilometres (10.08 sq mi). It is bounded by other communes, Castel Gandolfo, Albano Laziale, Rocca di Papa, Grottaferrata, and Ciampino. Marino is famous for its white wine, and for its Grape Festival, which has been celebrated since 1924.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe territory of Marino was inhabited by Latin tribes from the 1st millennium BC. The ancient cities of Bovillae (Frattocchie), Mugilla (Santa Maria delle Mole, a frazione of the comune of Marino) and Ferentum (Marino itself) were part of the Latin League. Under the Roman Republic it was a summer resort for Roman patricians, who built luxurious villas in the area to escape the heat of Rome.\u000aIn 846 AD, Bovillae - until then the largest settlement - was destroyed by the Saracens, and the population moved to the more easily defendable area of Ferentum, which was fortified under the new name of Marinum. From 1090 it was a dominium of the Counts of Tusculum, and later a fief of the Frangipane and, beginning in 1266, the Orsini. In 1272, San Bonaventura founded the first confraternity of Italy there.\u000aIn 1347 it was besieged in vain by Cola di Rienzo. Fifty years later, it was the site of the battle between Alberico da Barbiano and the French troops supporting Antipope Clement VII. In 1419 it was bought by the Colonna, who maintained it until 1914.\u000aMarino hosted famous historical figures, from Charles VIII of France to Alfonso II d'Este and many others. Vittoria Colonna was born in Marino in 1492 and lived there for part of her life. In 1571, Marino's people welcomed Marcantonio Colonna, a protagonist of the Battle of Lepanto, with a triumph, remembered yearly by a festival.\u000aIt became part of Italy in 1870.\u000aOn 14 March 1880 the railway Rome-Ciampino-Marino was opened for service. On 1 April 1906 an electric tram line replaced the former. In 1954 the electric tram line was replaced by buses.\u000aOn 2 February 1944, during World War II, Marino was heavily bombed by USAAF B-25 aircraft from the US XII Air Force.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Main sights ==\u000a\u000aBasilica of San Barnaba (17th century).

It houses a Mystery of the Holy Trinity, now recognized as from a pupil of Guido Reni.\u000aSanta Maria delle Grazie. It has a single nave with side chapels.

This festival is very famous in the surrounding area because, for about one hour, some of the city's fountains spill wine instead of water, recalling the memory of the old vintage and the historical event of the return to Marino of Marcantonio Colonna with 260 "Marinesi" from the Battle of Lepanto (7 October 1571).\u000aDoughnut Festival (Italian: Sagra della ciambella al mosto): Every 2nd Sunday of October. The doughnut (ring-shaped cake) made with flour, raisins and must (grape juice) is a typical product, a "marinese" cake, of limited production, only in the time of the grape harvest, a tradition based on a 17th-century recipe.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Twin towns ==\u000a Anderlecht, Belgium\u000a Boulogne Billancourt, France\u000a Hammersmith, United Kingdom\u000a Neukölln, Germany\u000a Zaanstad, Netherlands\u000a Paterna, Spain\u000a Irving, United States\u000a Nafpaktos, Greece\u000a\u000a\u000a== Famous citizens and residents ==\u000aSandro Benedetti, architect\u000aVittoria Colonna, poet\u000aGiacomo Carissimi, musician\u000aAlessandro Crescenzi, footballer\u000aDomenico Pacini, physicist\u000aPaolo Mercuri\u000aOrlando Fanasca, footballer\u000aRoberta Gemma, pornographic actress\u000aCesare Geronzi, businessman\u000aLuca Ippoliti, futsal player\u000aGiuseppe Ungaretti, poet\u000aUmberto Mastroianni, artist\u000aAnton Giulio Majano (Chieti 1909 \u2013 Marino 1994), film director\u000aHans Werner Henze, composer\u000aJacoba of Settesoli, (Torre Astura, 1190 \u2013 Assisi, 1236) disciple of St Francis of Assisi\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aHistory and culture in Marino (in Italian)\u000aThe sagra of Marino (in Italian)\u000a Ashby, Thomas (1911).

aVSamuel ben Hayyim Vital (1598 \u2013 1677) was a Kabalist born in Damascus in the latter half of the sixteenth century. While still young he married a daughter of Isaiah Pinto, rabbi of Damascus. Poverty compelled him to emigrate to Egypt, where, through the influence of prominent men, he was placed in charge of the cabalistic society Ti\u1e33\u1e33une ha-Teshubah. After a brief residence there he went to Safed, where he instructed the physician Joseph Zemah in Kabala. In the middle of the 17th century he returned to Egypt, where he died.\u000aSamuel Vital was the author of both cabalistic and rabbinical works. Among the former may be noted the Shemonah She'arim, an introduction to the Cabala, later embodied in the E\u1e93 \u1e24ayyim (Zolkiev, 1772; Korzec, 1785). Among his unpublished writings mention may be made of his Sefer To\u1e93e'ot \u1e24ayyim, a commentary on the Bible, and his Sefer Ta'alumot \u1e24okmah, on the Cabala.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography ==\u000aMoritz Steinschneider, Cat.

aVPlateosauravus ("grandfather of Plateosaurus") is a basal sauropodomorph of uncertain affinities from the late Triassic of South Africa.\u000aSidney Haughton named Plateosaurus cullingworthi in 1924 from a partial skeleton, type specimen SAM 3341, 3345, 3347, 3350-51, 3603, 3607. The specific name honoured collector T.L. Cullingworth. Friedrich von Huene reassessed it in 1932 as belonging to a new genus, that he named Plateosauravus. Jacques van Heerden reassigned it to Euskelosaurus in 1976, and this has been how it was usually considered. However, recent study indicates that Euskelosaurus is based on undiagnostic material and thus a nomen dubium; in his series of sauropodomorph and basal sauropod papers, Adam Yates has recommended no longer using Euskelosaurus and has suggested the use of Plateosauravus instead for what is normally thought of as Euskelosaurus.\u000aMore than a dozen additional partial skeletons have been found in the Kruger National Park after a discovery by game warden Adriaan Louw on 27 March 1995. These include juvenile individuals\u2190(Durand,2001).\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aAdam Yates on basal sauropodomorphs

aVA Long Return, also known by the title Largo Retorno in Spain, is a 1975 Spanish romantic film, directed by Pedro Lazaga.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000aA young vibrant college student, Anna (Lynne Frederick), catches eye of architect, David Ortega (Mark Burns), at an orchestra show. She quickly falls in love with him and eventually wins his love. The two become inseparable and fall madly in love with each other and marry. Soon after, Anna begins acting strange, experiences sudden fatigue, and memory loss (even forgetting her best friend). It is then her husband learns that she has a rare and deadly disease of the nervous system that is quickly killing her. While in the hospital, with her husband by her bed side, Anna suddenly goes into a state of a coma. Doctors tell David she has less than days to live. He pleads to the Doctor for help of any kind and they inform David that Anna's only chance of survival is to put her in a state of perpetual deep sedation, which would shut down her body and practically freeze her in time and prevent her from aging, until a cure can be found for her disease. With great optimism, David accepts and his wife is put in a state of sedation. For forty agonizing and heart acing years, David remains faithful to Anna and waits for a cure to be found while Anna\u2019s friends and family move on with their lives, even as going as far as wanting to pull the plug on her and bury her, as she remains sedated. A cure is finally found in 2014, forty years later, and she is successfully taken out of sedation and fully cured. When Anna awakens she is kept at the hospital for observations. She repetitively asks to see her husband, not knowing he is now middle aged and that she has been in sedation for forty years, but the doctor keeps denying her request. The ice is broken when her best friend, Irene (now well past her 60s), visits her and informs her of what has happened in the last forty years (such events like Anna\u2019s parents dying and the changes David has succumb to with age). When she is released from the hospital Irene takes her to David, and much to his delight, Anna greets him with overflowing love and affection as he welcomes her back with open arms. Later that night David expresses his trepidation and guilt of the age difference in their relationship. Anna reassures David that her love for him is still in there and tells him she loves him even more for him remaining faithful to her all those years. The couple has only a short time together as David dies (possibly of heart failure or old age) a few days later. After David\u2019s death, Anna\u2019s doctor comes by the house, asking the grief-stricken widow, where she will go from here. She replies, in a sorrowful manner, \u201cGo on living.\u201d Anna then has a flash back to her first date with David when he gave Anna her motto (\u201cToday is the first day of the rest of your life\u201d). She then tearfully glances at the doctor and utters to him \u201cToday is the first day of the rest of my life,\u201d knowing David would want her to go on living her life.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cast ==\u000aMark Burns ...

Mark Burns enjoyed working with Frederick recalling her being "just an overall sweet person and a very professional actress." Frederick herself did all her own singing for the film. The film was recorded in Madrid, Segovia, Venice and Mallorca, between 1974-1975. It was released in Spain on 26 May 1975, and then was only available in the mid 80\u2019s on PAL Betamax and VHS. It was released in English, Spanish, Italian, and English with Greek Subtitles. In Italy it was released under the title "A Venezia muore un'estate". The film was never available in the US on DVD or VHS. Today the film is out of print and physical copies are near impossible to find anywhere. With the increase of Lynne Frederick's new found cult following in recent years, the movie has become a fan favorite and enjoyed a second life on the internet with fans phrasing Frederick's acting and beauty in the film.

aVCharles Henry Chomley (28 April 1868 \u2013 21 October 1942) was an Australian farmer, barrister, writer and journalist. His non-fiction and fiction works alike reflected his strong interest and involvement in politics and law.\u000aHe was born in Sale, Victoria to banker Henry Baker Chomley and his wife Eliza (daughter of lawyer and politician Thomas Turner à Beckett). He was nephew to prominent Victorians Arthur Wolfe Chomley (barrister) and Hussey Malone Chomley (Police Commissioner) and uncle to Martin Boyd, noted Australian novelist.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Parents ==\u000aHenry Baker Chomley emigrated from Ireland to Australia with his mother, Mary Elizabeth Chomley, sister of Sir Richard Griffith, and his six brothers, following the death of their clergyman father, Rev Francis Chomley (1784-1847). In search of better opportunities and following the advice of her younger brother, Charles James Griffith and her older sister, Anne Greene who had arrived earlier, the Chomleys arrived on HMS Stag to Port Phillip, Victoria, in February 1849 and settled in Prahran, Victoria. Eliza à Beckett sailed with her father and family from London, arriving on HMS Andromache to Port Adelaide in December 1850. The pair married in Melbourne in 1863.\u000a\u000a\u000a== 1888 to 1900 ==\u000a\u000aCharles, the second of four children, graduated with a BA in 1888 and an LL.B in 1889 from Trinity College (University of Melbourne). He was admitted to the Victorian Bar in 1891, and in the same year wed his cousin, Ethel Beatrice Ysobel à Beckett, the youngest of six children (sister of Emma Minnie à Beckett Boyd, wife of Arthur Merric Boyd). After spending the following year with his wife and her family in England, Chomley left the legal profession in 1893 to establish a farming partnership in Australia with his cousin, Frank Chomley. With a group of friends, he settled in the King River Valley in northeast Victoria. Chomley was an Oxley Shire councillor from 1896\u201399 (president in 1898), but heart problems forced him to retire to Melbourne around 1900.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life as an Editor ==\u000aThe return to Melbourne signalled the launch of Chomley\u2019s journalistic career, and in the same year as retiring to the city, he took up his first editorship position at the illustrated weekly Arena. Dedicated to the arts, politics, and society gossip, the magazine also demonstrated strong support of both the suffragette movement and free trade. Such political persuasions would become increasingly evident in Chomley\u2019s later literary works. These works included novels, a biography, short stories, a children's book, and song lyrics, as well as various articles for the publications he contributed to or edited.\u000aOver the following few years, Chomley wrote and co-wrote several works, before setting sail for London in 1907. In 1908 he became editor of the British Australasian, a weekly tabloid that provided Antipodeans in London a link to news, markets, weather, and society information from home. Under Chomley\u2019s editorship, the magazine developed a distinctly more artistic tone, with some summer numbers featuring sketches, poetry, short stories and interviews with prominent members of the Australasian arts community in London. Themes he favoured in the Arena, such as the arts, politics and gossip, would become permanently infused in the magazine. Matters of religion were largely absent from its pages; after trialling several churches in Melbourne, Chomley had settled on Agnosticism. Chomley\u2019s daughters Isla and Francie regularly assisted in the writing of social columns and reviews, with nephews Penleigh Boyd and Martin Boyd also making contributions.\u000aDuring this time, Chomley\u2019s London home in Ladbroke Gardens became a social hub for his fellow Antipodeans; as Brenda Niall writes in her biography of the Boyd family, Chomley\u2019s restless temper and radical ideas fostered an environment in which topics of any manner could be discussed. During this period of his editorship, a relationship was purportedly cultivated with fellow British Australasian contributor and his wife\u2019s closest friend, Frances Fitzgerald Elmes (known as Frances Fawkner); it has even been suggested that Chomley fathered two of Elmes\u2019 children.\u000aBy 1914, the British Australasian was firmly established as a fixture of the Australasian community in London. Chomley would remain editor until his death in London in October 1942. Predeceased by his wife in 1940, Chomley left daughters Isla, Francie, and Betty and son Arthur Charles.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Political interests ==\u000aOne of Chomley's key interests as reflected in his professional and artistic endeavours was politics. The Australian political climate saw several dramatic changes around the turn of the 20th century, such as the women\u2019s suffrage movement, alongside many party amalgamations. Australia gained its first Prime Minister, Edmund Barton, in 1901 following the federation of the colonies. The 1906 federal election also created waves in Australian politics. This period and the previous years saw contentions by Protectionist, Labor and Free Trade (renamed as Anti-Socialists) Candidates. During this period, Charles Henry Chomley was secretary of the Victorian Citizens League, and had a consistent dialogue with leader of the Protectionist Party; Alfred Deakin. Chomley\u2019s involvement in politics is evident in the literary works he produced.\u000aHe was also a member of the Council of the Australian Free Trade and Liberal Association, 1904.\u000aChomley published his novel Mark Meredith: A Tale of Socialism in 1905. The novel is important in Australian literary history as it provides an insight into the political state of Australia at this time and is a reflection of the emotions of the Australian people Mark Meredith: A Tale of Socialism depicts a fictitious period in Australian history where socialism has been in place for numerous years. Chomley depicts a very negative view of socialism throughout this novel with the novel\u2019s hero Mark Meredith rising against the socialist powers.\u000aAnother politically inspired work by Chomley is Protection in Canada and Australasia published in 1904. It discusses the two federations of the British Empire in relation to free trade and protectionist battles. Tariff history, national policy and industrial welfare are all detailed by Chomley in this political non-fiction book.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Legal interests ==\u000aChomley's knowledge and interest in the law was also prominently reflected in his writing, influenced by his family's deep involvement in the colonial legal system.\u000aThe True Story of the Kelly Gang of Bushrangers, published in 1900, was a highly researched biography of the notorious 19th-century Victorian family of bushrangers. Chomley wrote the biography using court documents, police records and court evidence. It is recognised as being one of the most accurate depictions of the story of Ned Kelly, particularly regarding the police involvement. In his discussion of The True Story of the Kelly Gang of Bushrangers, Paul Eggert writes: "He often expresses scepticism about the extant accounts of events and of motives, but his attitude is always one of confident understanding and conservative judgement". As the nephew of Arthur Wolfe Chomley, the Assistant prosecutor at Ned Kelly\u2019s trial in 1880, and the nephew of Hussey Malone Chomley, a police officer during the Kelly years, Chomley had a unique insight into the case. Hussey Malone Chomley went on to become the Chief Commissioner of Police in Victoria (after F. C. Standish\u2019s resignation).\u000aChomley also published The Wisdom of Esau in 1901, another of his works that demonstrates an interest in the law. The novel was co-written with fellow farmer Robert Leonard Outhwaite. It is a fictional novel that examines land laws within Australia.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Critical reception ==\u000aChomley gained a largely positive critical reception for many of his works. His first novel The Wisdom of Esau was labelled both "a very readable romance of Australian life", and a collaboration that seemed to be "entirely successful". Likewise, his 1905 novel Mark Meredith: A Tale of Socialism gained considerable national attention, and was primarily well received by various critics. A less favourable review called Mark Meredith an "odd and grossly inferior parallel to Jack London\u2019s contemporary The Iron Heel".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Chomley-à Beckett-Boyd Family ==\u000a\u000aCharles Henry Chomley is a member of the Chomley, à Beckett, and Boyd family who have been synonymous with the establishment, the judiciary, publishing and literature, and the arts since the 1800s in Australia. Several of its members have prolifically contributed to Australian history in artistic as well as in political and legal roles.\u000a\u000aThe Chomley family name features most prominently in the legal sphere, particularly through accomplished family members Arthur Wolfe Chomley and Hussey Malone Chomley, in addition to several other Chomleys who studied and practiced law.\u000aThe à Beckett family were also well known for their involvement in the legal field. Sir William à Beckett (1806\u20131869) worked as a solicitor, barrister, judge, and eventually Chief Justice. William Arthur à Beckett (1833\u20131901) was a barrister, magistrate and a member of the Upper House. Thomas Turner à Beckett (1808\u20131892) was a solicitor and a member of Upper House. Arthur Martin à Beckett (1812\u20131871) worked as a doctor, member of the Lower House and was one of the first members of the Legislative Council of New South Wales. Sir Thomas à Beckett (1836\u20131919) was a barrister, judge and journalist. Sir Thomas' son, Thomas Archibald à Beckett (1868\u20131930), studied law with Chomley; the pair also competed together in the University of Melbourne's rowing team. Thomas would open a legal firm with Chomley's brother, Henry Rawdon Francis Chomley (1870-1954). The à Beckett, Chomley, and Henderson Solicitors was situated on Little Collins Street.\u000aThe Boyd family are most famously associated with their art within Australia. Arthur Merric Boyd (1862\u20131940) was an artist and the father of potter William Merric Boyd (1888\u20131959) and Theodore Penleigh Boyd (1890\u20131923), also an artist. William Merric Boyd had five children; Lucy, Arthur, Guy, David and Mary, all artists. Martin à Beckett Boyd was a novelist, poet, autobiographer and memoirist. His novel The Montfords (1928) won the Australian Literature Society's first gold medal (ALS Gold Medal) in 1929.\u000aThe family member with whom Chomley would share the strongest correlation, however, was Sir William à Beckett. In addition to his various legal roles, Sir William (Chomley\u2019s great-uncle) was a writer, journalist and poet. Chomley followed a similar professional path, first pursuing a career in law before channeling his artistic interests into a career in writing. While Sir William chiefly focused on short prose and poetry, also writing articles for the Port Phillip Herald, Chomley would primarily pursue journalism and novel writing.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected bibliography ==\u000aEarly editions of many of the following works by Chomley are held in the collections of the Mitchell Library and the Fryer Library within the University of Queensland Library.\u000aNovels\u000aThe Wisdom of Esau (1901) (with Outhwaite, R.

aVThe Liberation Monument is a monument in Pyongyang, North Korea. It was built in 1947 to honour Red Army soldiers who took part in liberating Korea from Imperial Japanese occupation during the final stage of the Second World War. Soviet paratroopers took control of Pyongyang on August 24, 1945. The monument is composed of a stele surmounted by a five-pointed red star, with the entire structure attaining a height of 30 meters. The square base of the monument bears an inscription on each of its sides. The text, in Russian and Korean, describes the purpose of the monument. The monument is often visited by official delegations as well as by tourists and city residents. It has become traditional for newlywed couples to visit the monument as well.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Inscriptions ==\u000a\u000aPrimary Russian text (Front side):\u000a\u000a\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043b \u044f\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043e\u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434. \u041a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044c\u044e, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043e\u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0438, \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0443\u0437\u044b \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0431\u044b \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u0412 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\u043d\u0443\u0442 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a. 15 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 1945 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430.\u000a\u000aEnglish translation:\u000aThe great Soviet people defeated the Japanese imperialists and liberated the people of Korean.

aVThe Adsit Log Cabin in Willsboro, New York has long been said to have been built by Samuel Adsit in 1778 and is believed to be one of the oldest log cabins in the United States that still exists in its original location. Adsit was an American Revolutionary War veteran and he built the cabin for his family of sixteen when he moved to Willsboro Point at some time following the war; the Town Historian's records suggest that this was soon after 1790. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in August 1992.\u000aIt is believed that the house survived due to its eventual containment within a larger structure, which was later torn down. In the 1980s, the town of Willsboro undertook a $70,000 restoration project that brought the cabin to its current condition. The furnishings have been dedicated by descendants of the Adsit family.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aAdsit Log Cabin\u000aHidden Historical Treasure: Adsit Cabin

aVScience fiction television has been produced in Australia since the 1960s, as a homegrown response to imported overseas US and British shows.\u000aArtransa Park productions made a number of programmes in collaboration with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on shoestring budgets, these generally running for one season and being aired on ABC TV. They included The Stranger (1964\u201365), The Interpretaris (1968), Vega 4 (1967), and Phoenix Five (1970). Phoenix Five was the best known of these. It resembled US shows like Star Trek without the budget and effects, but with a pscychedelic rock soundtrack.\u000aThere was also Alpha Scorpio and this led to Andra. Adapted from the novel by Louise Lawrence, Andra won a 1976 Penguin Award for its quality production. The ABC claims to retain copies of Andra in its archives, but controversy surrounds this claim. Insiders claim the tapes were wiped by accident when they were sent to Malaysia.\u000aThe ABC produced one further Science Fiction series, the drama Timelapse, featuring Robert Colby and John Meillon in an Orwellian future.\u000aMore recently, Australia's most well known Science Fiction show was Farscape, made with American co-production. It ran from 1999 to 2003, and was filmed at Sydney's Fox Studios.\u000aA significant proportion of Australian produced science fiction programmes are made for the teens/young Adults market, including The Girl from Tomorrow, Watch This Space, the long-running Mr. Squiggle, Halfway Across the Galaxy and Turn Left, Parallax, and the Jonathan M. Shiff Productions programmes Ocean Girl, Thunderstone, and Cybergirl.\u000aThe Australian Children's Television Foundation, a government initiative, produces a number of Science Fiction children's shows, including Spellbinder (in collaboration with Poland), The Miraculous Mellops, and The Crash Zone. A number of these are adaptations of children's books.\u000aIn the late 1990s, Community TV in Melbourne (Channel 31) screened the independent science fiction series, Damon Dark, about a government agent who investigates UFO reports and hunts alien invaders, which has gone on to become a webseries for YouTube.\u000aThe forthcoming television version of Star Wars will be a Lucasfilm production shot in Sydney.\u000aOther shows like Time Trax, Roar, and Space: Above and Beyond were filmed in Australia, but used mostly US crew and actors.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aCategory:Australian science fiction television series\u000aScience fiction on television\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aMagicdragon.com UltimateSF - Science Fiction Produced in Australia\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000aJuddery, Mark.

aVMalvin Gray Johnson (January 28, 1896 \u2013 October 4, 1934) was an African-American painter, born and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina. His family moved to New York City, where he studied art at the National Academy of Design. He rose to prominence during the Harlem Renaissance. He was "the youngest member of the Harlem Renaissance artists...migrated to New York with his family at an early age...where he was influenced by French Impressionism and Cubism." Malvin "was one of the most far-reaching and versatile artists of his period. He drew upon many stylistic sources and demonstrated the disciplined learning necessary for high levels of creative expression...as he became familiar with the works of the Impressionists and the Cubists his artistic style changed."\u000aHis work is often labeled as Symbolic Abstractionist, being one of the first African-American artists to paint in the Cubist style. Elements of his art seem also to derive from studies of African sculpture. He concerned himself with technical aspects of light, composition, and form, and a desire to express the experience of the spirituals in terms of abstract symbolism.\u000aLike many other artists, Johnson worked on the Federal Arts Project during the Depression. His work was displayed in many of the Harmon Exhibits in 1929 and the early thirties. In 1931 some of his work was hung in the Anderson gallery and the following year, the Salon of America displayed several of his paintings. In 1928 he won a prize at a Harmon exhibition, and in 1929 he won the Otto H. Kahn prize for painting. "Johnson's painting 'Swing low sweet chariot' was awarded the 1929 exhibition prize for best picture in the second Harmon group show." (Calo, p. 140)\u000aJohnson was featured in the 1930s film A Study of Negro Artists, along with Richmond Barthé, James Latimer Allen, Palmer Hayden, Aaron Douglas, William Ellisworth Artis, Augusta Savage, Lois Mailou Jones, Georgette Seabrooke, and others associated with the Harlem Renaissance.\u000aTowards the end of his life, Johnson produced a group of watercolors of urban and rural blacks, many of which were set in Brightwood, Virginia. These paintings from his final period, are more widely regarded as some of his finest works.\u000aIn The Negro in American Culture, Margaret Just Butcher argued that some of Johnson's paintings "are among the most significant commentaries on the American Negro scene." Alain LeRoy Locke said that Johnson captured the cynical humor and mythical desolation in the moods of blacks better than most artists. Viewing Johnson as a maturing experimentalist, James A. Porter wrote that his later work was expressed in terse, pregnant patches of color.\u000aThe exhibition of his oils, watercolors and drawings in 2002 at North Carolina Central University was the first since his death in 1934.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Auction records ==\u000aOn February 23, 2010, Swann Galleries auctioned Malvin Gray Johnson\u2019s celebrated painting Swing Low, Sweet Chariot, oil on canvas, 1928\u201329, for $228,000.

aVA muzzle booster or recoil booster is a device affixed to the muzzle of a firearm, intended to harness the energy of the escaping propellant to augment the force of recoil on portions of the firearm. Muzzle boosters are usually used to improve the reliability and/or rate of fire of a recoil operated firearm. The muzzle booster is the antithesis of the muzzle brake, which is designed to use the propellant gases to reduce the recoil of the firearm. However, unlike a muzzle brake, a muzzle booster uses the pressure of the expanding gases, rather than the reaction force, and it does not alter the felt recoil of the weapon, it merely adds more energy to the operating components.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe recoil booster was first introduced in the Vickers machine gun of 1912. The Vickers, like the Maxim gun from which it was developed, uses a short-recoil action. At firing, the recoil from the cartridge pushes the barrel and bolt together backwards within the gun. This movement provides the energy required to extract and eject the spent cartridge, and compresses the recoil spring to complete the cycle. The muzzle booster increased the recoil force transmitted to the barrel by directing some of the escaping gas into pushing the barrel back rather than letting it all expand outwards at the muzzle, in essence acting as an auxiliary gas-operating system, with the barrel acting the role of the operating rod. This increased the initial velocity of the barrel and bolt, providing more energy for the operation of the mechanism.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Construction ==\u000a\u000aA Vickers-type booster (the "typical" muzzle booster type) consists of two parts; the first is a flared "cup" on the muzzle of the barrel and the second is a perforated tube around the end of the muzzle, attached to the main body of the weapon, and with an end closed except for a small hole for the bullet to pass through. As the bullet exits the barrel, the expanding gases follow it into the chamber created between the cup and the shroud. As it passes through the close tolerance hole in the end of the perforated tube, it temporarily forms a blockage to further forward movement of the expanding gas from the barrel. The pressure inside the booster rises very rapidly as the gases continue to expand in the confined space (even after the bullet has cleared the hole, the gas pressure is still very high). The cup on the muzzle of the barrel provides a large, movable surface for the gas to push against, as it exerts force equally in all directions. As the outer shroud is fixed to the main frame of the gun, and only the barrel is movable, the pressure forces the cup and barrel to the rear, acting exactly as a piston in a cylinder. As the barrel cycles to the rear, the cup passes the perforations in the outer shroud, opening an escape path for the gases, immediately lowering the pressure, both reducing the harsh impact when the barrel reaches full recoil and preventing the remaining pressure from the gases from acting as a "spring" and slowing the barrel when it begins to travel forwards again (which would only slow the rate of fire). The barrel continues to the rear on its own momentum, and actuates the operating mechanism. The resulting action can be seen as a composite of the recoil action and a gas action \u2014 the barrel being acted upon as if it were the piston. Muzzle boosters in other weapons act in a similar fashion.\u000aAs one can see, the pressure within the muzzle shroud is exerted equally in all directions, pushing forwards on the shroud with the same force as it pushes the muzzle cup and barrel to the rear; thus, the actual felt recoil of the weapon is not increased, even though the force imparted to the operating system is. Thus, the name of "recoil booster" can be misleading. It is unlike a muzzle brake in that the muzzle booster extracts work from the pressure of the expanding gasses, while a muzzle brake relies on redirecting the reaction force of the fast moving gases at the muzzle. In fact, by trapping and slowing, and then redirecting the gases sideways, the device called a "recoil booster" actually somewhat reduces the felt recoil of the weapon, by eliminating the reaction component of expanding gases escaping the muzzle in a forward direction.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Historical applications ==\u000aThe original use of the recoil booster was to provide additional energy to move the large barrel/bolt mass on recoil operated machine guns. The primary German machine gun of WWI was the Maxim-based MG 08, a water-cooled heavy machine gun which used a muzzle booster to increase rate of fire and reliability. Like the Vickers, the MG 08's barrel was surrounded by a heavy water-jacket for cooling; the MG 08's component measured 105 mm in diameter. The cooling jacket for both ordnance designs also acted as the frame within which the barrel recoiled on firing, and which the fixed portion of the muzzle booster was mounted on. In 1915 an air-cooled version was created for use as a fixed aircraft gun, designated the lMG 08 (or LMG 08, traditionally with a lower case "L"). Eliminating water cooling saved a great deal of weight, but the water jacket was a crucial component of the gun, as it held the bushing which supported the muzzle end of the barrel and allowed it to recoil. Thus, the water jacket structure was retained, but was heavily perforated to allow cooling air-flow to reach the barrel, leaving more open space than metal. This much-lightened structure, resulting from just over 50% of the jacket's circumferential sheetmetal removed for its cooling slots; was strong enough to support the barrel, but not enough to handle the powerful forward counter-force created when the expanding gases in a muzzle brake forced the barrel rearwards. Thus, early versions of the lMG 08 deleted the muzzle booster, although later versions of the lMG 08, and its replacement, the lightened-receiver LMG 08/15 model which reduced the cooling barrel's diameter to just 92.5 mm, changed to a less-heavily perforated barrel shroud which could handle a muzzle booster, as it was realized that with the airflow over an aircraft-mounted machine gun, the fifty-percent-plus amount originally removed had been excessive. The World War II-era German MG 42 was another such machine gun which also made use of a muzzle booster. This application has largely fallen out of use as modern machine gun design switched to delayed blowback and gas operation in many cases. The Rheinmetall MG 3, essentially an MG 42 modified to use the standard 7.62×51mm NATO round, and currently used by the German military, still uses a boosted short recoil design.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Modern applications ==\u000aRecoil boosters have found a use in suppressors on short-recoil operated semi-automatic pistols (i.e., most modern centerfire pistols chambered for 9mm and above). Such pistols have a barrel and slide assembly which recoils a short distance upon firing before the barrel is unlocked from the slide (usually by tilting the barrel in order to separate the interlocking lugs on the barrel and the slide). Since the weapon relies on momentum to carry the slide all the way to the rear to operate the mechanism, and it is designed to work with a given weight of slide and barrel, and a given power of cartridge, adding the extra weight to the barrel by screwing on a suppressor will interfere with the gun's ability to properly cycle the action after each shot, resulting in stoppages. By incorporating a recoil booster (also known as a Nielsen device), the weight of the suppressor can be uncoupled from the barrel at the moment of firing, allowing the pistol to function properly by boosting the recoil energy of the barrel and slide, and by temporarily decreasing the effective attached weight. This is achieved by mounting the body of the silencer to a spring, which attaches to a piece that screws onto the muzzle of the firearm. When fired, the force of the gases expanding inside the baffles of the suppressor act to force the suppressor body forward in relation to the barrel. The spring allows the barrel to recoil while the suppressor stays in place; the pressure of the gases between the two components helps force them apart as well, much like the VIckers-type boosters described above. Many suppressor boosters incorporate an indexing system which allows the suppressor to be reoriented in a number of different rotational positions, allowing the end user to fine-tune the weapon's point of aim.\u000aSome blank firing adapters (BFAs) act as recoil boosters, harnessing the gases produced by the blank cartridge to compensate for the lack of back pressure that would normally occur as the bullet traps the expanding propellant gases until the bullet clears the barrel. This is important on gas-operated firearms, as they rely on tapping some of the pressure built up behind an accelerating bullet moving up the barrel. Without a bullet to act as a "plug", the gases simply rush out the muzzle without generating enough pressure to cycle the weapon properly, since such devices are often fine-tuned to work only within a certain limited range of gas pressures.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Symphony in B minor "Polonia", Op. 24, was written by Ignacy Jan Paderewski between 1903 and 1908, and first publicly performed in 1909. Although he lived for another 32 years, the symphony was virtually Paderewski's last composition; he wrote only one more work before his death in 1941 - a hymn for male chorus in 1917. Around 1910, he commenced what would become a political career, culminating in becoming the first Prime Minister of independent Poland and signing the Treaty of Versailles on behalf of his nation in 1919. He later returned to the concert platform as a virtuoso pianist.\u000aPaderewski started sketching the Symphony in B minor in his home near Morges in Switzerland in 1903. The work was completed in 1908 and was given a private performance in Lausanne on 26 December 1908. Its public premiere was with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under the German conductor Max Fiedler, on 12 February 1909. It was soon performed in Paris under André Messager, and in London under Hans Richter. The symphony had its Polish premiere in January 1911, where it was presented to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Frédéric Chopin, conducted by Paderewski's devoted friend Henryk Opie\u0144ski. It also had performances in Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore. It has had little concert exposure since that time. To mark the 70th anniversary of the composer's death, it was performed in June 2011 at the Polish Presidential Palace under the patronage of President Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski, by Sinfonia Varsovia under Jerzy Maksymiuk. (Maksymiuk made the first Western un-cut recording of the work in 1998.)\u000a"Polonia" is in three movements, although Paderewski originally planned a four-movement work, which would have included a scherzo. As it is, the three movements he did write take about 75 minutes to perform, which extraordinary length has often caused it (particularly the finale) to be cut in performance and recording.\u000aThe three movements are:\u000aAdagio maestoso - Allegro vivace (30')\u000aAndante con moto (17')\u000aVivace (27').\u000aIt is often described as a programme symphony, the three movements depicting:\u000athe glorious days of Poland of the past\u000aPoland of the present day (1907), at the nadir of political subjugation\u000athe approach of a happier future for Poland.\u000aThe inspiration for the title "Polonia" seems to be a series of eight \u2018cartoons\u2019 published under that title in 1863 by Artur Grottger, depicting the grim realities of everyday life and struggle under Russian occupation. Grottger's "Polonia" was a response to the failed insurrection of 1863-65 known as the January Uprising. Paderewski initially intended to dedicate the work to the 40th anniversary of that event, in which his own father was caught up and even arrested, but no such dedication appears in the score.\u000aThe music is expansive and discursive, not sticking closely to any pre-determined form. This quality has attracted comment that Paderewski seems to often lose his way, and also overdevelops his themes.\u000aIt is lush and romantic in texture, leading to comparisons with the music of Liszt, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, Rachmaninoff, Mahler, Scriabin, Glazunov, Balakirev, Myaskovsky, Korngold, Glière, Elgar, Rimsky-Korsakov, Richard Strauss, and even a precursor of Shostakovich.\u000aThe score very unusually calls for three sarrusophones, a tambour de Basque, a thunder sheet and an organ. The full instrumentation is: piccolo, 3 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets in A, bass clarinet in A, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 4 trumpets in F, 3 trombones, tuba, 3 contrabass sarrusophones in E\u266d, timpani, percussion (triangle, cymbals, tambourine, bass drum, tambour de Basque, tam-tam, glockenspiel, bells, thunder sheet), harp, organ and strings.\u000aThe finale contains a disguised quotation of the Polish national anthem, Jeszcze Polska nie zgin\u0119\u0142a (Poland Is Not Yet Lost), in duple meter rather than the original's triple-time mazurka rhythm.\u000aIn 1915, Edward Elgar wrote an orchestral piece titled Polonia, Op. 76, which he dedicated to Paderewski.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Recordings ==\u000aBBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra under Jerzy Maksymiuk\u000aSymphony Orchestra Music Academy, Kraków, under Wojciech Czepiel\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aSymphony in B minor (Paderewski): Scores at the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP)

aVFrank Williams Racing Cars was a British Formula One team and constructor.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early years ==\u000a\u000aFrank Williams had been a motor-racing enthusiast since a young age, and after a career in saloon cars and Formula Three, backed by Williams' shrewd instincts as a dealer in racing cars and spares, he realised he'd reached his peak as a driver and started entering other drivers, in particular his friend and sometime flatmate Piers Courage. After Williams backed Courage in a successful 1968 Formula Two season, he purchased a Brabham Formula One car for Courage in 1969. This allegedly angered Jack Brabham, as the car had been sold to Williams with the expectation that it would be used in the Tasman Series and then converted to Formula 5000. Courage in fact had a great year, taking second place at both the Monaco and US Grands Prix.\u000aTheir efforts attracted the interest of Italian sports car manufacturer De Tomaso, who built a Formula One chassis (designed by Gian Paolo Dallara) for the 1970 season. However, the car was initially uncompetitive, failing to finish the first four races of the year. In the fifth, the Dutch Grand Prix, the De Tomaso 505/38 flipped and caught fire, killing Courage. The death of his friend seriously upset Williams; the subsequent distance the team principal placed between himself and his drivers has been attributed to this event. The team soldiered on, however, first with Brian Redman, then with Tim Schenken. With no results, the partnership with De Tomaso was dissolved.\u000aFor 1971, Williams purchased a year-old March 701, and ran Frenchman Henri Pescarolo. The team later upgraded to a new March 711, but results were difficult to come by. The old car was also entered for Max Jean at the French Grand Prix. After the success of 1969, Williams was now low on funds, living a hand-to-mouth existence from race to race. Pescarolo did, however, keep the outfit ticking over with fourth place at the British Grand Prix and sixth in Austria.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Frank Williams Racing Cars (1969\u20131975) ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Politoys and the FX3 ===\u000aFrench oil company Motul came on board for the 1972 season, enabling Williams to buy a new March 721 for Pescarolo, while backing from Italian toy manufacturer Politoys provided money to build an in-house chassis. From the (non-Championship) Brazilian Grand Prix, Carlos Pace was entered in the previous year's March 711, later taking fifth at the Belgian Grand Prix.\u000aThe Len Bailey-designed Politoys FX3 was a conventional Cosworth-engined car with a Hewland FG400 gearbox. It debuted in the hands of Pescarolo at the British Grand Prix, but the steering failed and the car was heavily damaged. Pescarolo switched back to his March 721 while the Politoys was rebuilt. In its last appearance as the Politoys FX3, Chris Amon drove the car for the team in the end of season non-Championship 1972 World Championship Victory Race at Brands Hatch, but qualified only 20th and retired with engine failure.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Iso\u2013Marlboro and the FX3B ===\u000aMotul and Politoys both withdrew their backing at the end of 1972, but Williams managed to attract backing from cigarette giant Marlboro and Italian sports car manufacturer Iso Autoveicoli S.p.A. for the 1973 season. The Politoys FX3 was reworked as the Iso\u2013Marlboro FX3B and a second car was built. Two new drivers were signed, New Zealand's Howden Ganley and Italy's Nanni Galli.\u000aAt the first race in Argentina, Galli qualified 16th with Ganley 19th and last on the grid. Galli's engine failed on the first lap, but Ganley finished the race, although he was not classified due to being 17 laps adrift of the winner. The team fared better in Brazil with Ganley finishing seventh and Galli ninth. Galli was then injured testing a sports car and replaced for the following race in South Africa by local driver Jackie Pretorius. Pretorius retired his FX3B at half-distance with overheating problems, but Ganley managed tenth, albeit six laps down.\u000aThe FX3B had become obsolete by this time due to new deformable structure regulations and was replaced by the new Iso\u2013Marlboro IR. However, the FX3B was raced in two non-Championship races at this time; at the 1973 Race of Champions, Tony Trimmer raced an FX3B to fourth place while Ganley retired his car with handling problems. The New Zealander also retired at the FX3B's last race, the 1973 BRDC International Trophy, this time with low oil pressure.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Iso\u2013Marlboro IR, FW and first Williams ===\u000a\u000aIntroduced at the 1973 Spanish Grand Prix, the Iso\u2013Marlboro IR was driven by eight different drivers during the rest of the 1973 season. Ganley was the only regular driver and he scored a point with the car at the Canadian Grand Prix towards the end of the season. Of the other drivers; Galli, Pescarolo, Tom Belsø, Graham McRae, Gijs van Lennep, Tim Schenken and Jacky Ickx, only van Lennep was able to score a point, at his home race in the Netherlands.\u000aBoth Iso Rivolta and Marlboro left before the 1974 season, leaving Williams with financial problems. The two IR chassis were retained, now re-designated the FW after Frank Williams, but initially only a single car was entered for Arturo Merzario, who had replaced Ganley as the team's number one driver. There was an early-season boost as Merzario placed sixth in the third race of the season in South Africa, but when the second car was reintroduced, the string of paydrivers employed to drive it produced little in the way of results. After three non-qualifications, Jacques Laffite was brought in to partner Merzario and performances gradually improved, culminating in a fourth-place finish for Merzario in Italy. This gave the team a total of four points, and another tenth-place finish in the Constructors' Championship. Three Iso\u2013Marlboro FW chassis were ultimately used during 1974, including a newly built car, and these were renamed Williams FW01, FW02 and FW03 for 1975; separate designations despite the three cars being essentially the same.\u000aMerzario and Laffite stayed on for the start of the 1975 season as the team continued to use the FW02 and FW03. The new Williams FW04 replaced the FW02 at the Spanish Grand Prix, and promising British youngster Tony Brise substituted for Laffite, finishing just outside the points in seventh. By this time, however, the team's money problems had become serious, and Merzario left following the Belgian Grand Prix, his place taken for the rest of the season by six different paying drivers \u2013 Ian Scheckter, François Migault, Ian Ashley, Jo Vonlanthen, Renzo Zorzi and Lella Lombardi. Northern Ireland's Damien Magee, meanwhile, substituted for Laffite in Sweden.\u000aA major shock came in Germany when a mixture of attrition and tenacious driving saw Laffite take the FW04 to second place behind the Brabham of Carlos Reutemann, bringing much-needed financial aid to a team on the point of collapse. This was to be the team's only points finish of the season, but they improved their position in the Constructors' Championship by one place, to ninth.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Wolf\u2013Williams Racing (1976) ==\u000aBefore the start of the 1976 season, Canadian oil millionaire Walter Wolf bought 60% of Frank Williams Racing Cars and the team became Wolf\u2013Williams Racing. However, Frank Williams was retained as team manager. Soon afterwards, Harvey Postlethwaite arrived as chief engineer. Simultaneously Wolf bought the assets of the Hesketh team that had recently withdrawn from F1. The team was based in the Williams facility at Reading but used most of the cars and equipment once owned by Hesketh Racing. The team inherited the Hesketh 308C car used by Hesketh Racing during the final races of 1975, rebranding it as the Wolf\u2013Williams FW05 and the Williams FW04 was similarly rebranded as the Wolf\u2013Williams FW04, although it was only used in the opening race of the season, the 1976 Brazilian Grand Prix.\u000aAt season's end, Wolf decided to restructure the team, removing Frank Williams from the manager's job. Disillusioned, Williams left the team altogether, to set up Williams Grand Prix Engineering with Patrick Head in 1977. Wolf bought 100% of Wolf\u2013Williams Racing and the team became Walter Wolf Racing.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Complete Formula One World Championship results ==\u000a(key)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aV"I'm Not Your Hero" is a song written, recorded and performed by Canadian duo Tegan and Sara and produced by Greg Kurstin for the album Heartthrob (2013). Recorded at Echo Studio and EastWest Studios in California in 2012, it was released on October 21 of that year as a promotional single. The lyrics for the new wave synthpop ballad were written by Sara Quin, and discuss her teenage life in the 1990s when she was unable to identify with the lives of pop culture figures and had unforeseen thoughts about her later life. Guitar chords, drums, bass guitar, synths and harmonized vocals are also played in the track.\u000a"I'm Not Your Hero" was mostly well received by critics for its songwriting and composition. The track garnered comparisons to the works of Santigold, Fleetwood Mac and The Temper Trap. Commercially, it peaked at number 58 on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 and 157 on the French SNEP singles chart. Tegan and Sara have performed it at the Austin City Limits Music Festival, their Let's Make Things Physical tour, and on shows and services such as Soundcheck and Queen's TV.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production and composition ==\u000a\u000aIn November 2011, it was revealed on Tegan and Sara Quinn's official website that they were writing new material for their seventh studio album: "[we] are back in our home studios working away at more songs. We\u2019re really looking forward to making a new record now. Our hope is to be in the studio by early 2012." "I'm Not Your Hero" was written for the album, which was later named Heartthrob and recorded between February and May 2012. Sara, who wrote the lyrics, said the song was based on her life as a teenager when she was unable to identify with the lives of pop culture figures and had unforeseen thoughts about her future. She claimed the lyrics were about her political views from watching The West Wing, her identity and her sexuality. Tegan stated that when Sara showed the song to her and the producers, it was initially more of a love song and much more acoustic and slow than the final mix that would be released, and said she "was haunted by it almost immediately. I found the verses to be quintessential Sara."\u000aAccording to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Naked in a Snowsuit Publishing, the new wave synthpop ballad is performed in common time at a tempo of 122 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of A Major, with the vocal range spanning from E4 to D6. A chord progression of A5\u2212E5\u2212F\u266fm\u2212Dmaj7\u2212F\u266fm\u2212E\u2212Dmaj7 is followed in the verse, D\u2212A in the pre-chorus, and D\u2212E\u2212F\u266fm\u2212D in the chorus. The track opens with guitar chords before loud drums are played. Harmonized vocals, bass guitar and blurred synthesizers are also parts of the track's arrangement. Reviewers made comparisons of its musical structure to songs such as "L.E.S. Artistes" by Santigold, The Temper Trap's "Sweet Disposition", and the works of Fleetwood Mac.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Release and live performances ==\u000a"I'm Not Your Hero" was first available for digital download in the United Kingdom as part of their compilation extended play called In Your Head: An Introduction to Tegan and Sara, which was issued on October 19, 2012. On October 21, it was released as a promotional single for worldwide streaming. It received mostly positive reviews from critics upon its release, some calling it one of the best songs off Heartthrob. Brodsky described it as "a track that honors their previous work but shows their dedication to musical development." Bryne Yancey of Punknews.org wrote the song "blows out its chorus rather impressively from the verses with some neat, alternated instrumentation." A more mixed opinion came from Billboard's Jason Lipshutz; he praised the song's "eloquent" message, but felt the track overall was not as engaging as the other songs on the album.\u000aIn an interview with MTV Hive, Tegan and Sara said "I'm Not Your Hero" was one of their favorite songs to perform live. The duo first did so, along with "Now I'm All Messed Up" and "I Was a Fool", in Vancouver on September 23, 2012. They performed it at the 2012 Austin City Limits Music Festival, and the song was also a part of the set list of their 2014 "Let's Make Things Physical" promotional tour. In April 2014, the pair played it at the Juno Awards in Burton Cummings Theatre live on Queen's TV. The duo has performed two acoustic renditions of the song, one in November 2012 in a studio session for Alter The Press!, and in July 2013 on their interview by the WNYC program Soundcheck.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Credits and personnel ==\u000aThe following information adapted from the liner notes of Heartthrob:\u000aLocations\u000aRecorded and engineered at Echo Studio, Los Angeles, California; drums recorded at EastWest Studios, Hollywood, California\u000aMixed at Larrabee Sound Studios, Los Angeles, California\u000aMastered at Bernie Grundman Mastering, Hollywood, California.\u000aPersonnel\u000a\u000a\u000a== Charts ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aLyrics of this song at MetroLyrics

The Day of the Clown introduces main character Rani Chandra (Anjli Mohindra) and her parents, Haresh (Ace Bhatti) and Gita Chandra (Mina Anwar), and they would stay for the rest of the series.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Part One ===\u000aLuke Smith (Tommy Knight) is struggling to adjust to life without Maria Jackson (Yasmin Paige), she having moved to Washington, D.C. with her father. Meanwhile, the Chandras move into the Jacksons' old house on Bannerman Road and Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) starts an investigation into disappearing children in the area. Sarah Jane makes Luke and Clyde promise her that they will not reveal her alien investigating secrets to the newcomers to Bannerman Road.\u000aClyde Langer (Daniel Anthony) and Luke meet new girl Rani Chandra at school. After Clyde sees a clown in school prior to the sudden disappearance of a child, Rani reveals she is being stalked by a clown that no one else can see. With Clyde having got into trouble with the new Headteacher, Rani's father, Luke arranges to keep an eye on Rani in his place and goes round to her house to help her unpack. Sarah Jane and Clyde link the disappearances of the children to the Museum of the Circus, Clyde and two of the missing children having received tickets for it. Rani, who wants to become a journalist, begins her own investigation and makes the same connection to the Museum having found a ticket in a school book belonging to one of the missing children and having a ticket herself.\u000aSarah Jane and Clyde explore the Museum of the Circus and encounter Elijah Spellman (Bradley Walsh). Soon they are joined by Rani and Luke and Spellman sets his robotic clowns on the group. Sarah Jane halts the clowns with her sonic lipstick, and Luke theorises that Spellman is an alien. As Sarah Jane, Luke, Clyde and Rani attempt to escape the building, Spellman reveals himself to have been the legendary Pied Piper of Hamelin and now Odd Bob the Clown seeking to feed off their fear.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Part Two ===\u000aSarah Jane and the rest escape through the back door. Then Sarah Jane tells Luke about why she's scared of clowns saying that a clown toy in her room apparently came to life when she was young. The next morning, Rani looks out of her bedroom window and sees Odd Bob's balloon in her garden. When she gets to the school she tells Luke and Clyde, then a load of balloons fall down from the sky, all the school children pick them up (apart from Luke, Clyde and Rani) and fall under the spell from Odd Bob, behaving much like the Pied Piper story. But Mr. Smith uses the cellular phone system to interfere with Odd Bob's control and the children are released. Then Odd Bob suddenly kidnaps Luke, and Sarah Jane must face her fears to save Luke. Then Clyde uses his funny jokes to dissipate their fear. Odd Bob requires fear to exist, and without it, he is forced to return to the meteorite he used to come to Earth. Sarah Jane puts the meteorite into a box from which nothing can escape, not even thoughts. In the end, Clyde says how the universe is always full of surprises after everyone gets invited to the Chandra's for dinner.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Continuity ===\u000aThe First Doctor, John and Gillian first meet the Pied Piper in the comic Challenge of the Piper. This is also the first story to ever feature the Pied Piper in any Doctor Who media.\u000aChrissie Jackson is revealed to be getting married and her daughter, Maria, is expected to return for the wedding.\u000aHaresh Chandra replaces Mr Blakeman as Headteacher of Park Vale High School, Blakeman having seemingly disappeared during Revenge of the Slitheen.\u000aClyde reminds Luke of the disappearing children and the alien Kudlak seen in Warriors of Kudlak.\u000aSarah Jane refers to her Aunt Lavinia, who appeared in K-9 and Company and was first mentioned in The Time Warrior. We learn more about Sarah Jane's upbringing with her Aunt Lavinia.\u000aOne of the clowns shown on Sarah Jane's laptop is a promotional photo of Carmen Silvera as Clara the Clown from the 1966 Doctor Who serial The Celestial Toymaker.\u000aProfessor Rivers of the Pharos Institute previously appeared in The Lost Boy.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Outside references ===\u000aAfter Sarah Jane reveals her fear of clowns, Luke reveals that he knows Johnny Depp is also coulrophobic having read it in Heat. Spellman outlines the history of clowns citing Pharaohs' fools, harlequins, Native American clowns and Mediaeval court jesters, and numerous references are made to the legend of The Pied Piper of Hamelin.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Broadcast and reception ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Broadcast ===\u000a"Part One" was first broadcast on the CBBC Channel at 5.15 p.m. on Monday 6 October 2008 and was repeated as part of CBBC on BBC One at 4.35 p.m. on Monday 13 October 2008.

"Part Two" was first broadcast on the CBBC Channel at 5.15 p.m. on Monday 13 October 2008 and was repeated on BBC One at 4.35 p.m. on Monday 20 October 2008.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Critical reception ===\u000aWriting for Dreamwatch, Matt McAllister asserts that there may not be "quite enough here to sustain a double-episode worth" but observes that there are "memorable scenes, including an ingenious final showdown." He states that Walsh is "appropriately sinister...as Odd Bob the Clown" and describes Rani as "likeable", noting that having her father as the new Headteacher is "a nice little twist". McAllister thinks that the story "owes a big debt to Stephen King\u2019s It" (1986) and that it has shades of Torchwood episode "From Out of the Rain" and Doctor Who serial The Greatest Show in the Galaxy. In conclusion, McAllister notes that "[t]his may not be earth-shattering kids\u2019 TV, but it\u2019s good creepy fun nonetheless."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Novelisation ==\u000aThis was the eighth of eleven Sarah Jane Adventures serials to be adapted as a novel. Written by Phil Ford, the book was first published in Paperback on 6 November 2008.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aThe Day of the Clown on Tardis Data Core,  an external wiki\u000aThe official BBC The Sarah Jane Adventures website\u000aPress Pack information regarding The Day of the Clown at the BBC Press Office website\u000aThe Day of the Clown at Doctor Who: A Brief History of Time (Travel)\u000aThe Day of the Clown at the Doctor Who Reference Guide\u000a"The Day of the Clown" on IMDb\u000aDay of the Clown title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database

aVTim Williams (born November 5, 1979) is an American singer-songwriter folk musician, based in Los Angeles, California, United States. He has released two albums, two EPs and several singles on Dovecote Records and is signed with Modern Outsider Records as a part of the band Soft Swells.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aWith roots in the Midwest, Williams' music career began in Boston, Massachusetts with a self-released EP Songs For the Commute. After one year in Boston, Williams moved to New York and immediately began writing and recording a second release while staying at the Hotel Chelsea. These sessions turned into his two subsequent albums, 8/18 Chelsea Sessions and Tales of Digression, which would soon after become the first two releases on the Dovecote Records label.\u000aWilliams supported these releases playing small clubs and venues in the US and UK. In 2004 he met London-based producer Dave Lynch during a showcase at the CMJ festival in New York City. Lynch offered to record Williams' next record if he ever found himself in the UK again. In November, 2005, Williams moved in with friends in Eastbourne, England and began writing and recording with Lynch. The resulting album (When Work Is Done) marked Williams first release with national exposure. He embarked on multiple tours making stops at South By Southwest, CMJ, and the Sundance Film Festival. His video for "Novel" won MTV's weekly video contest The Freshman.\u000aWilliams' third studio album, Careful Love, should be approached with a few more personal facts in mind: he wrote it after open heart surgery, while in love, and displaced from Brooklyn to California.

aVKiffa beads are rare powder glass beads. They are named after the Mauritanian city of Kiffa, where French ethnologist R.Mauny documented them first in 1949.\u000aKiffa beads represent one of the highest levels of artistic skill and ingenuity in beadmaking, being manufactured with the simplest materials and tools available: pulverized European glass beads or fragments of them, bottle glass, pottery shards, tin cans, twigs, steel needles, some gum arabic, and open fires. The term Kiffa bead, named after one of the old bead making centres of Kiffa in Mauritania, was coined by United States bead collectors during the 1980s.\u000aAccording to Peter Francis, Jr., the making of powder glass beads in West Africa may date back a few hundred years, and to possibly 1200 CE in Mauritania. Maure powder glass beads are believed to copy older, Islamic beads, of the type made in Fustat and elsewhere. Although the making of Mauritanian powder glass beads appears to be an ancient tradition, no archaeological evidence to establish their age has been found to date.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production ==\u000a\u000aGlass which is finely crushed to a powder is mixed with a binder such as saliva or gum arabic diluted in water. Decorations are made from the glass slurry i.e. crushed glass mixed with a binder and applied with a pointed tool, usually a steel needle. The beads are placed in small containers, often sardine cans and heated to fuse the glass on open fires without moulds.\u000a\u000aKiffa beads were made in various shapes: blue, red, and polychromatic triangles with yellow, black, white, red and blue chevron-type and decorations that resemble eyes; blue, red and polychromatic diamond-shaped beads; cigar shaped and conical beads as well as a variety of small spherical and oblate beads. Colour sequences observed on traditional beads with polychromatic decorations are always the same, i.e. red-yellow-black (dark brown)-yellow-red-white-blue-white. Often the obverse is decorated as well, and it is believed that different bead making families had their own distinct styles. For their wearers, all these beads held amuletic properties. The colours, shapes and the many different intricate decorative patterns all having specific meanings, most of them forgotten today.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Uses ==\u000a\u000aDiamond-shaped Kiffa beads were traditionally worn on bracelets, sewn onto strips of leather, and arranged in traditional sets composed of a specific ratio of blue to red to polychromatic specimens. Their patterns are believed to protect and to increase the fertility of their wearers and it has been proposed that some might imitate cowrie shells. Triangular-shaped and spherical beads were worn as hair ornaments and traditional assemblages could be composed of two complementary sets of three triangulars each, one blue, one red and one polychromatic, worn at temple height. Many of the small spherical or oblate-shaped beads were hair ornaments or worn in necklaces in various combinations with other glass and stone beads and were made by decorating a red, blue or white preformed glass bead "core". Glass slurry decorations were applied to moulded 19th century beads possibly of Czech origin. Smaller, cigar shaped or cylindrical beads are often also found to have been constructed from two or even three of the moulded beads. These are fragile and tend to break apart easily.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Modern beads ==\u000a\u000aWith the passing of the last of the remaining traditional bead makers during the 1970s, Kiffa bead crafting became extinct. Since the early 1990s, organized groups of women bead makers are again making Kiffa beads, using basically the same traditional methods. The craftsmanship of the new beads, however, has never reached the high standards and the quality that can be observed in the old beads. Western artists have made their own versions in polymer clay or lampworked glass, but none of the modern creations come close to resembling the beauty of traditional specimens. The same applies to modern imitations made elsewhere, for instance in Indonesia.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000aAllen, JD (1996). "Kiffa Beads".

aVIsopogon axillaris is a small shrub that is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Taxonomy ==\u000aIt was first described by Robert Brown in 1810. In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze published Revisio generum plantarum, his response to what he perceived as a lack of method in existing nomenclatural practice. Because Isopogon was based on Isopogon anemonifolius, and that species had already been placed by Richard Salisbury in the segregate genus Atylus in 1807, Kuntze revived the latter genus on the grounds of priority, and made the new combination Atylus axillaris for this species. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus Isopogon was nomenclaturally conserved over Atylus by the International Botanical Congress of 1905.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe McLaughlin Group is a syndicated half-hour weekly public affairs television program in the United States, where a group of four pundits, prompted by the host, discusses current political issues in a round table format. John McLaughlin hosted from its first episode in 1982 until his death in 2016.\u000aThe program was revived on January 7, 2018 with Tom Rogan as the host, on one station, WJLA-TV, in Washington, D.C., on Sundays at noon, as well as online.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Format ==\u000aThe general format for the show consisted of moderator John McLaughin questioning four commentators, usually Pat Buchanan, Eleanor Clift, Clarence Page, Tom Rogan and Mort Zuckerman during the show\u2032s final years. Members of the regular panel varied over the years.\u000aA typical episode covered three or four issues. The first was introduced by McLaughlin, beginning with, "Issue one..." which was explained by him, usually in a prerecorded video segment accompanied by his voice-over. He then proposed a question for the panelists, starting with Buchanan (if present). The conversation was usually sedate at the beginning of the program, but as opposing viewpoints emerged there was more verbal rough-housing, good-natured gamesmanship and occasionally very loud crosstalk as panelists attempted to out-yell the others, all of which were the show's trademarks.\u000aTwo episodes at the turn of the calendar year were reserved for "The McLaughlin Group Year-End Awards". Each panelist announced his or her choice for each category such as \u201cBiggest Winner of 2008,\u201d \u201dBest Politician,\u201d \u201cMost Boring,\u201d \u201cTurncoat of the Year,\u201d \u201cEnough Already,\u201d \u201cMost Underrated,\u201d etc., followed by McLaughlin\u2019s choice. During the first of these special episodes, the participants typically dressed in festive Christmas attire; in the second, they typically dressed in formal evening wear for the New Year.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== In popular culture ===\u000aMcLaughlin\u2019s loud and forceful style of presentation was parodied by many comedians and other commentators, most notably Dana Carvey of Saturday Night Live McLaughlin made a cameo on one of Carvey\u2019s parody sketches. The program was also included in a few major films, including Dave, Murder at 1600 and Independence Day. In the movie Watchmen, the group was portrayed discussing the nature of Dr. Manhattan. In the videogame MechCommander 2, the fictional discussion panel "think tank" closely resembled The McLaughlin Group's basic format -- a moderator in between four commenters, McLaughlin's speech patterns, general appearance, etc.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Criticism ==\u000aJournalists James Fallows and ex-McLaughlin panelist Jack Germond opined that the show gloried too much in sensationalism and simplification, to the detriment of serious journalism. Ronald Reagan, while in office as U.S. president, once referred to McLaughlin and his group as taking the traditional Sunday morning talk show format of a moderator with a group of journalists and turning it into "a political version of Animal House."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Syndication ==\u000aThe original incarnation aired on PBS member TV stations and the PBS digital subchannel World as well as on some local commercial TV stations, including WCBS-TV in New York City. During its run, underwriters included Pfizer, the New York Stock Exchange, and GE (the longest-serving).\u000aThe show was distributed by WTTW. In the United States, it was carried on numerous public broadcasting stations and, from May 2007 to August 2016, a small number of CBS-affiliated stations. Most stations carried the program on weekends, but there were a few, like WGBH in Boston, Kentucky Educational Television stations across Kentucky, Mississippi ETV in Jackson, Mississippi, PBS channel 8 KUHT in Houston, Texas, WGVU Channel 35/WGVK Channel 52 Grand Rapids/Kalamazoo, Michigan, and PBS channel 3 KBTC in Tacoma, Washington, that ran it on Friday evenings, and WHUT-TV Channel 32 in Washington, D.C., aired it on Tuesdays. Internationally, the show was carried on several satellite channels, such as Voice of America TV and it was on the London-based CNBC Europe. It was also carried by CTV in Christchurch, New Zealand, and by Triangle TV in Auckland, New Zealand.\u000aFrom its start until May 2008, the program originated from WRC-TV, the NBC-owned station in Washington, D.C. From May 2008 until it ended in August 2016, the show was produced at WUSA-TV, the Tegna-owned CBS affiliate for Washington, D.C., where it also aired in that market.\u000a\u000a\u000a== McLaughlin's final episode ==\u000aIn the final months of the show's run, McLaughlin took a smaller role in the panel's weekly discussions due to health issues and a wavering voice. The McLaughlin Group recorded its last episode on August 12, 2016, without him on camera. It was the only episode he missed in the show's 34-year history, although his voice introduced the week\u2032s issues in pre-taped voiceovers. The episode began with a written statement from McLaughlin, which read:\u000a\u000aDear Friends of The McLaughlin Group, Dr. McLaughlin here. As the panel\u2032s recent absences attest, I am under the weather. The final issue of this episode has my voice, but please forgive me for its weaker than usual quality. Yet my spirit is strong and my dedication to this show remains absolute!\u000a\u000aPanelist Pat Buchanan then began the episode by saying, "This is our first time in 34 years that our distinguished leader Dr. McLaughlin is not in his chair and we miss him. But let's get on with the show." Buchanan, Eleanor Clift, Clarence Page, and Tom Rogan recorded the show without a moderator. Rogan closed the episode by saying, "On behalf of the panel, we want to say to John that we're thinking of you and you have our very best."\u000aFour days after the recording of the last episode, John McLaughlin died at the age of 89 on August 16, 2016. On August 18, 2016, WTTW's chief content officer Dan Soles announced that The McLaughlin Group had ended production. He told The Hollywood Reporter in a statement, "This long-running political commentary and discussion show was consistently an audience favorite, and we will miss this important contribution to our political coverage. WTTW is proud to have brought the series, and Dr. McLaughlin, to the PBS system."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Revival ==\u000aIn August 2017, a test pilot for a revived McLaughlin Group appeared on YouTube. The panelists were Pat Buchanan, Eleanor Clift, Clarence Page, and former CIA officer and 2016 presidential candidate Evan McMullin. Tom Rogan served as the host of the program. According to Buchanan's official website, the panelists are hoping to sell the revived show to a network so that the McLaughlin Group can be "back on the air on a full-time basis."\u000aOn December 22, 2017, it was announced that the program would return in 2018 with Rogan as host; longtime panelists Eleanor Clift, Pat Buchanan and Clarence Page were also set to return.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Panelists ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Regular McLaughlin panelists ===\u000aRegular panelists\u000aPat Buchanan: political commentator and author\u000aEleanor Clift: contributor, MSNBC and The Daily Beast\u000aClarence Page: columnist, The Chicago Tribune\u000aTom Rogan columnist, Washington Examiner\u000aAppeared every several months\u000aPaul Glastris: editor, Washington Monthly\u000aMort Zuckerman: owner, New York Daily News and U.S. News & World Report\u000aDavid Rennie: columnist, The Economist\u000aFormer regular panelists\u000aTony Blankley, Lawrence O'Donnell, Michael Barone, Jack Germond, Rich Lowry, Robert Novak, Morton Kondracke, Fred Barnes, Lawrence Kudlow, Chris Matthews, Al Hunt, Mark Shields, Michael Kinsley, Monica Crowley, Katty Kay, Susan Ferrechio, Jay Carney\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aJohn McLaughlin's One on One\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOfficial website\u000aPodcast, both video and audio\u000aThe McLaughlin Group on IMDb\u000aThe McLaughlin Group at TV.com

aVThe Code of Conduct and the Vietnam War is a report from an individual research project conducted by John McCain, Commander, United States Navy, at the National War College. It has a 44 pages and was released on April 8, 1974.\u000aThe purpose of this paper was to review the Code of Conduct in the perspective of the Vietnam prisoner of war experience and to make recommendations for changes to the code itself and to the training and indoctrination of the members of the Armed Forces in the Code of Conduct. Additionally, recommendations are presented for the education of the members of the Armed Forces and the U.S. public in order to minimize the use of POWS in the future as political hostages and propaganda vehicles.\u000aThe Vietnam War was the first test of the Code of Conduct. The majority of the American POWS were held captive longer than in any other war engaged in by Americans. The paper discusses the Code of Conduct, article by article, and assesses its value and viability as they related to the Vietnam War experience. The report compares conditions and treatment American POWs experienced in Vietnam, and how it affected their ability to live up to the code.\u000aIn the report Commander McCain writes that, "The American people have been inoculated with too many John Wayne movies and other examples of unbreakable will and super human strength. It has been amply proved that every man has a breaking point."\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a[1] The Code of Conduct and the Vietnam War, by John S McCain, Commander United States Navy\u000a"The Code of Conduct and the Vietnam Prisoners of War", by John S.

aVThe Madonna della Scala is a Baroque-style Roman Catholic church located in via Madonna della Scala #2 in the neighborhood of San Giuliano in the city of Rimini, Italy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe church was built in 1611, near the former Porta Gervasona in the medieval walls of the city. The church was built near the site of a miracle. In 1608, a young man and his horse fell into the river Marecchia near a tower at the site, with stairs (Scala) leading to the bank. He prayed for help from an icon of the virgin that had been painted on the tower. His rescue led to veneration of the icon by sailors. The icon, painted by the local painter Alessandro Codrini in 1608, became a source of veneration for sailors; it has been restored over the centuries. The church was refurbished in 1717.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

By choosing the magnifying factor to be the factorial of b, the fraction a\u2044b and the b\u2009th partial sum are turned into integers, hence x must be a positive integer. However, the fast convergence of the series representation implies that the magnified approximation error x is still strictly smaller than 1.

In 1891, Hurwitz explained how it is possible to prove along the same line of ideas that e is not a root of a third degree polynomial with rational coefficients. In particular, e3 is irrational.\u000aMore generally, eq is irrational for any non-zero rational q.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aCharacterizations of the exponential function\u000aTranscendental number, including a proof that e is transcendental\u000aLindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVSugaring, sugar waxing or Persian waxing is a method of hair removal that has been in use since 1900 BC. Historically, sugar was confined to the regions surrounding Persia until the first millennium AD. As a result, it is speculated that honey was the first sugaring agent. Sugaring was also known as sukkar or \u1e25alawa in the Middle East, as a\u011fda in Turkey, and as moum in Iran.\u000aSugaring is often compared to standard waxing. During the process, a sugaring substrate sticks to and essentially removes hair without attaching to the skin. The substrate can be applied at room temperature or heated to a lukewarm temperature, minimizing the risk of burns. For this reason, sugaring is generally preferred over waxing when it comes to removing hair from larger areas of skin. If someone has sensitive skin, sugaring can nevertheless result in skin irritation and reaction. However, this can sometimes be prevented by taking an anti-histamine. Sugar itself is otherwise hypoallergenic.\u000aThere are some distinct differences between home and professional-use sugar paste. The majority of store-bought products contain wax, while homemade pastes often utilize sugar and other natural ingredients.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sugaring paste ==\u000aSugaring paste can be prepared with common household food items such as water, sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, honey and molasses. Lemon juice is added for its acidity, which breaks up the sucrose into fructose and glucose. As in candy making, this gives the finished sugaring wax a non-crystalline, or amorphous, structure. Getting the correct consistency takes practice for most users. Pre-made sugar paste is also sold. This includes professional and retail versions, which may contain guar gum for texture or essential oils to condition skin. Since sugaring paste is water-based and water-soluble, the substance can be easily cleaned up with warm water. Sugaring is sometimes preferable to waxing because it has no resins, except for guar.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Process ==\u000aWith the strip method, the area to be epilated is typically dusted with powder (commercial or corn starch) prior to application of the sugaring solution, which is spread on with a spatula or tongue depressor. Some eco-friendly salons have noted that these products are not necessary for applying the sugaring solution. After the sticky paste is applied to the skin in the same direction of hair growth, a strip of porous cloth or paper is pressed into the preparation and quickly removed, with the strip taking hairs along with it. In contrast to traditional waxing, any sugaring paste residue left can be washed off with water. The process can be repeated after 8\u201310 days of hair growth- unlike the 3\u20134 weeks worth of hair growth traditional waxing requires. \u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000awikibooks:Body Hair Removal/Equipment#Sugar\u000a"Sugaring Hair Removal Recipe".

aVZhang Xianzhong or Chang Hsien-chung (September 18, 1606 \u2013 January 2, 1647), nicknamed Yellow Tiger, was a leader of a peasant revolt from Yan'an, Shaanxi Province. He conquered Sichuan in 1644, and named himself king of the Xi (Da-Xi) dynasty. His rule in Sichuan was brief and he was killed by the invading Manchu army. He is commonly associated with the massacres in Sichuan that depopulated the region. However, the extent of his killings is disputed.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Background ===\u000aZhang was born in Dingbian, Shaanxi province, China, into a poor family. He was described as tall in stature, had a yellow complexion and a heavy chin ("tiger chin" (\u864e\u9894) in Chinese figurative description), and hence was given the nickname "Yellow Tiger". He served in the Ming army, and while in the army he was sentenced to death for violations of military rules, but was reprieved after an intervention by a senior officer who was impressed by his appearance.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== As rebel leader ===\u000aTowards the end the Ming Dynasty, drought, famines and epidemics broke out in various part of China. In the late 1620s, peasants revolted in Shaanxi, resisting attempts by the Ming government to collect grains and taxes. They coalesced into rebel armies called "roving bandits" (liúkòu \u6d41\u5bc7) because of their highly mobile nature, and spread into other parts of China. Zhang escaped from the army, joined the rebel forces in Mizhi County in 1630, and established himself as a rebel leader, styling himself Bada Wang (\u516b\u5927\u738b, Eighth Great King). His mobile forces would conduct raids along the western edge of Shaanxi, plundering swiftly and hiding out in the hills. Later he moved into other provinces, moving from place to place raiding towns and cities. He was defeated at various times by the Ming forces; Zhang would also surrender when it was expedient for him to do so, for example in 1631 and 1638, but would then later regroup and resume rebellion.\u000aIn 1635 he joined a larger confederation of bandits that included another rebel leader, Li Zicheng (Li would later capture Beijing and end the Ming Dynasty). They devastated Henan and pushed into Anhui. After they had burnt the Ming ancestral temple at Zhongdu (Fengyang) in Anhui and ravaged the area, the rebel armies broke up and Zhang headed to Hubei. In 1637, joined by other rebels and with an army now reaching a size of 300,000 men, he again pushed into Anhui, then to Jiangsu, and almost down to Nanjing. But he was defeated there and he retreated back to Hubei. In 1638, he surrendered to Ming supreme commander Xiong Wencan (\u718a\u6587\u71e6) and was allowed to serve as a regional Ming commander. However, he reneged on the agreement in 1639 and rebelled, and later defeated the Ming forces led by the Ming general Zuo Liangyu (\u5de6\u826f\u7389). In 1640, he suffered defeats at the hand of Zuo and had to flee with few followers into the mountains of Eastern Sichuan. In 1641 he emerged from Sichuan and attacked Xiangyang, capturing and executing the imperial prince there.\u000aIn 1643, he took Macheng in Hubei, and his army swelled to some 57,000 after incorporating the city's rebels. He then captured the provincial capital of Wuchang, killed the imperial prince there, and proclaimed himself "Xi Wang" (King of the West). Wuchang however was soon recaptured by Ming forces, and for a while Zhang stayed at Changsha where he controlled much of Hunan and part of Jiangxi.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Conquest of Sichuan ===\u000aIn 1644, Zhang decided to abandon Hunan and led 100,000 of his troops towards Sichuan. His army converged on Chongqing from two directions and surrounded the city. After several days of fighting, his army managed to blast a hole through the city wall and captured the city on July 25, 1644. He was said to have cut off the hands of the city's defenders and massacred a large number of people.\u000aThe conquest of much of the rest of Sichuan was made easier after he announced to the locals that they would not be harmed if they seized their officials, took possession of the storehouse and surrendered without resistance. He took Chengdu in September 9, 1644, and met no real opposition in the rest of Sichuan afterwards. He then set up court in Chengdu, which he renamed Xijing (\u897f\u4eac, Western Capital), and declared himself king of the Daxi Dynasty (\u5927\u897f\u738b\u671d, Great Western Dynasty).\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Rule in Sichuan ===\u000a\u000aIn Sichuan he attempted to set up a civil administration and initially gained considerable support. According to an account by Gabriel de Magalhães, a Portuguese Jesuit who was working in Sichuan with another Jesuit Lodovico Buglio (but both pressed to serve as astronomers to Zhang), "he began his rule with such liberality, justice and magnificence by which he captivated all hearts that many mandarins, famous both in civic as in military affairs whom fear was keeping concealed, left their hideouts and flew to his side."\u000aHowever, resistance to his rule did not cease, and Chongqing was retaken by Ming loyalists in the spring of 1645. Zhang then embarked on a campaign of terror, which was well under way by the middle of 1645, to stamp out the remaining resistance in Sichuan. In November 1645, according to de Magalhães, Zhang, after hearing that "a huge and powerful army was coming against him", announced that "the people of his kingdom had a secret pact with the enemy and planned an uprising; because of this he was determined to kill all, leaving not one person alive". The Jesuits, who now "understood the evil of this man", reported that while they managed to save a few of their people who were taken, the rest were killed. Zhang's policy of terror increased in intensity, especially in 1646 after he had decided to abandon Sichuan. By then, Zhang's government had virtually disintegrated, all but three of his principal officials had either committed suicide or were executed.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Death ===\u000aThe Manchu Aisin Gioro founded the Qing Dynasty in 1636 and invaded south of the Great Wall after the fall of the Ming Dynasty in 1644. In 1646 the Qing sent out a force under the leadership of Haoge intending to attack Zhang's domain in Sichuan. In October 1646, Zhang decided to abandon Sichuan, and headed towards his homeland in Shaanxi. However, the Qing army was also approaching from Shaanxi, and in January 1647, Zhang and the Qing forces met in Xichong where Zhang had set up camp, and he was killed in the confrontation. According to one account, he was betrayed by one of his officers, a native of Sichuan named Liu Chin-chung (Liu Jinzhong) who resented his policy of terror in Sichuan. He pointed Zhang out to the Manchus when Zhang rushed out from his tent on learning of the betrayal, and he was then shot and killed by a skilled Manchu archer.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Devastation of Sichuan ==\u000aThe events surrounding Zhang Xianzhong's rule and afterwards devastated Sichuan, where he was said to have "engaged in one of the most hair-raising genocides in imperial history". Lurid stories of his killings and flayings were given in various accounts. According to Shu Bi (\u8700\u78a7), an 18th-century account of the massacre, after every slaughter, the heads were collected and placed in several big piles, while the hands were placed in other big piles, and the ears and noses in more piles, so that Zhang Xianzhong could keep count of his killings. In one incident, he is said to have organized an imperial examination ostensibly to recruit scholars for his administration, only to have all the candidates, which numbered many thousands, killed. In another, to give thanks for his recovery after an illness, he was said to have cut off the feet of many women. The severed feet were heaped in two piles with those of his favorite concubine, whose feet were unusually small, placed on top. These two piles of feet were then doused in oil and set alight to become what he called "heavenly candles".\u000aHe was reported to have ordered further massacres before he abandoned Chengdu in advance of the invading Manchus. The massacres, a subsequent famine and epidemic, attacks by tigers, as well as people fleeing from the turmoil and the invasion of the Manchus, resulted in a large-scale depopulation of Sichuan. The worst affected areas are believed to be Chengdu and its surrounding counties, and places on the path of Zhang's retreat from Chengdu to Shaanxi.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Seven Kill Stele ===\u000a A popular account of his life has it that he erected in Chengdu a stele, which came to be known as the Seven Kill Stele (\u4e03\u6bba\u7891), with the following inscription:\u000aThere are, however, considerable doubts that this account is accurate. In 1934, a stele thought to be this very one was found by a missionary \u2013 its reverse side contains an added inscription by a Ming general commemorating Zhang's numerous victims whose bones he had collected and buried in 1646. While the first two lines of the poem on this stele are similar, the line with the seven kills is absent in this stele. Instead the actual line reads: "The spirits and gods are knowing, so reflect on this and examine yourselves" (\u9b3c\u795e\u660e\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u601d\u81ea\u91cf). Many therefore considered the story to be a distortion from the Qing era.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Deaths ===\u000aThe actual number of people killed by Zhang is not known and is disputed. Official Ming Dynasty history Ming Shi recorded a figure of 600 million deaths due to Zhang's activities, an obvious exaggeration, since the total population of China at that time was less than 150 million, perhaps much lower. According to an assessment by a modern historian, "the death toll is reputed to have been enormous, possibly one million out of a total provincial population of three million, before he was eventually killed by the Manchus." The combination of deaths from the massacres and other causes as well as flight of people from the province resulted in a sharp drop in the population of Sichuan. The population has been estimated to have dropped by as much as 75%, with fewer than a million people left in Sichuan, most of whom were clustered in the periphery areas. The last Ming census figure for Sichuan in 1578 (more than 60 years before Zhang entered Sichuan) gave a population of 3,102,073. However, by 1661, only 16,096 adult males were registered in Sichuan, and Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers. A later figure for Sichuan was from the 1720s, which is over 70 years after Zhang's death and long after the resettlement of Sichuan had begun, and it recorded 634,802 households (which one estimate calculated to be around 2.5 million individuals).\u000aMany, while acknowledging the massacres committed, do not believe that Zhang was responsible for the greater part of the population collapse in Sichuan, and thought that the greatest loss happened after his death due to the continuing turmoil, famine and diseases. Some argued that while a great many died, Sichuan did not become virtually depopulated as recorded. Some modern Chinese historians considered him a proto-revolutionary, maintaining that accounts of the massacres were exaggerated, or were committed by others including the invading Manchus, that his victims were Ming nobles, rich landlords, and other "counter-revolutionary" elements, and that his heinous reputation was the result of "Qing slanders" and "reactionary propaganda".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Aftermath ==\u000aBefore he had abandoned Sichuan, Zhang divided his forces into four divisions, each led by one of his four generals (Li Dingguo, Sun Kewang, Liu Wenxiu, Ai Nengqi). These remnants of the his army, as well as Ming loyalists, held out in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou after Zhang's death, and most of Sichuan did not come under control of the Manchus until a dozen years or so later, and fighting only finally ended in eastern Sichuan in 1664.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Resettlement of Sichuan ===\u000aIn order to fill up the depopulated regions of Sichuan, a massive resettlement program was initiated during the Qing Dynasty, starting around 1670 or 1671 and lasting more than two centuries. Millions of people from Hubei, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Shaanxi and other provinces were resettled in Sichuan. Some of the early migrants were those who returned after fleeing Sichuan (including the ancestors of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping), but some were also coerced. A large number of the migrants came from Huguang (now Hubei/Hunan), and the migration was therefore described by 19th century scholar Wei Yuan as "Huguang filling Sichuan" (\u6e56\u5ee3\u586b\u56db\u5ddd). This migration in turn triggered another massive resettlement: "Jiangxi filling Huguang" (\u6c5f\u897f\u586b\u6e56\u5ee3). By the 1720s, 70\u201380% of the population of Sichuan was reportedly non-native, and as much as 85% a century later.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Primary sources ===\u000aLiu Xianting \u5289\u737b\u5ef7, Guangyang zaji \u5ee3\u967d\u96dc\u8a18 (in Chinese)\u000aMingshi \u660e\u53f2 (History of Ming) (in Chinese)\u000aPeng Zunsi \u5f6d\u9075\u6cd7 (fl. 18th century), Shu Bi \u8700\u78a7 (in Chinese)\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Secondary studies ===\u000aHe, Rui \u4f55\u9510 (2002), Zhang Xianzhong jiao Sichuan shilu \u5f20\u732e\u5fe0\u527f\u56db\u5ddd\u5b9e\u5f55 [Records of Zhang Xianzhong's Destruction of Sichuan], Chengdu: Ba-Shu Shushe \u5df4\u8700\u4e66\u793e, ISBN 978-7-80659-327-1 .

aVIran (officially the Islamic Republic of Iran) competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, from 5 to 21 August 2016. Since the nation's debut in 1948, Iranian athletes had attended in every Summer Olympic Games of the modern era, with the exception of the 1980 and 1984 Summer Olympics.\u000aThe National Olympic Committee of the Islamic Republic of Iran fielded a team of 63 athletes, 54 men and 9 women, across 15 sports at the Games. It was the nation's third-largest delegation sent to the Olympics, and featured Iran's highest female participation in history. Men's volleyball was the only team-based sport in which Iran was represented at the Games, the nation's Olympic debut. Wrestling accounted for the largest number of athletes by an individual-based sport with 12 entries; there was only a single competitor each in archery, boxing, flatwater canoeing, rowing, and swimming.\u000aThe Iranian roster featured a number of past Olympic medalists, including discus thrower Ehsan Haddadi, who won the nation's first ever athletics medal with a silver, and four defending champions from London: weightlifter Behdad Salimi, and Greco-Roman wrestlers Hamid Sourian, Omid Norouzi, and Ghasem Rezaei. Other notable Iranian athletes included table tennis player Noshad Alamian and his younger brother Nima in the men's singles, rifle shooter and London 2012 finalist Elaheh Ahmadi, and paraplegic archer Zahra Nemati, who significantly became the nation's first ever female athlete to earn an Olympic or Paralympic title four years earlier. Consequently, Nemati's story and sporting success prompted her to lead the Iranian delegation as the nation's third female flag bearer in Olympic history during the opening ceremony.\u000aIran left Rio de Janeiro with a total of 8 medals (3 gold, 1 silver, and 4 bronze), finishing twenty-fifth in the overall standings. Five of these medals were awarded to the team in wrestling, two in weightlifting, and one in taekwondo. Among the nation's medalists were taekwondo fighter Kimia Alizadeh, who became the first Iranian woman to stand on the podium by taking the bronze, and weightlifter Kianoush Rostami, who bested his runner-up feat from London, lifting a new world record for gold in the men's 85 kg category.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Medalists ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Competitors ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Archery ==\u000a\u000aOne Iranian archer qualified for the women's individual recurve by obtaining one of the three Olympic places available from the 2015 Asian Archery Championships in Bangkok, Thailand.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Athletics ==\u000a\u000aIranian athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event):\u000aKey\u000aNote\u2013Ranks given for track events are within the athlete's heat only\u000aQ = Qualified for the next round\u000aq = Qualified for the next round as a fastest loser or, in field events, by position without achieving the qualifying target\u000aNR = National record\u000aN/A = Round not applicable for the event\u000aBye = Athlete not required to compete in round\u000a\u000aMen\u000aTrack & road events\u000aField events\u000aWomen\u000aField events\u000a\u000a\u000a== Boxing ==\u000a\u000aIran has entered one boxer to compete in the men's light heavyweight division into the Olympic boxing tournament. 2012 Olympian Ehsan Rouzbahani was the only Iranian finishing among the top two of his respective division in the AIBA Pro Boxing series.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Canoeing ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Sprint ===\u000aIran has received a spare berth from the International Canoe Federation to enter a boat in the men's C-1 200 m to the Olympics, as the next highest-ranked nation, not yet qualified, at the 2015 Canoe Sprint World Championships, and as a response to the forfeiture of five boats held by the Russians due to their previous doping bans and their implications in the "disappearing positive methodology" set out in the McClaren Report on Russia's state-sponsored doping.\u000aQualification Legend: FA = Qualify to final (medal); FB = Qualify to final B (non-medal)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cycling ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Road ===\u000aIranian riders qualified for a maximum of three quota places in the men's Olympic road race by virtue of their top 4 national ranking in the 2015 UCI Asia Tour.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Fencing ==\u000a\u000aFollowing the completion of the Grand Prix finals, Iran has entered two fencers into the Olympic competition.

His father was James Mayer de Rothschild, head of the Paris branch of the prominent Rothschild family of bankers.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Career ===\u000aAs a young man, according to the Goncourt brothers, he squandered "a million on the stock exchange in attempted secrecy from his father" and was exiled to Frankfurt, where he spent two years keeping books. After this, his father wrote to him, "Mr. Salomon's affair is not terminated." Rothschild was dispatched to America, where he was supposed to help advance the family's banking interests.\u000aFrom 1859 to 1861, he traveled extensively in the United States, Canada and Cuba. He was an eyewitness to the events leading up to the American Civil War. He regarded Abraham Lincoln as an extremist and his political sympathies lay with the Confederate cause. In letters to his family, he described in vivid terms the social customs and notable events of the day, including the visit of the future King Edward VII, the high wire act of Charles Blondin, the arrival of the first official Japanese embassy to the United States, and the maiden voyage of the SS Great Eastern.\u000aAs a representative of the world's most prominent banking family, he traveled with a ten-person retinue and mingled with high society wherever he went, always taking note of beautiful and well-dressed women along the way. The lawyer George Templeton Strong, met Salomon and described him thus: "the Baron, though illustrious and a millionnaire, was immoderately given to lewd talk and nude photographs." His English cousin Constance, daughter of Anthony de Rothschild, described him as "brilliantly gifted but less addicted to steady work and habits of business than his brothers...genial, brilliant, somewhat dare-devil."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Personal life ===\u000a\u000aSalomon married Adèle von Rothschild (1843\u20131922), daughter of his cousin Mayer Carl von Rothschild. Their daughter Hélène de Rothschild became the Baroness Hélène van Zuylen van Nijevelt de Haar, after her marriage to the Dutchborn Roman Catholic Baron Etienne van Zuylen van Nijevelt van de Haar (1860\u20131934) of the House of Van Zuylen van Nijevelt.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Death ===\u000aHe died in Paris on May 14, 1864, at the age of 29, only two years after his marriage and less than a year after the birth of his daughter, Helene (1863\u20131947). He was buried at Pere Lachaise Cemetery in the family vault. Of his death, the Goncourt brothers wrote "Cabarrus, the Rothschild's doctor, told Saint-Victor that the young Rothschild who died the other day really died of the excitement of gambling on the stock exchange."\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000aDiamond, Sigmund, ed.

In 1820 he issued, in two volumes, Reprints of Rare and Curious Tracts relating to English History, containing 16 seventeenth-century pamphlets, with reproductions of contemporary portraits and a few notes.\u000aFollowing in Caulfield's footsteps, Smeeton issued in 1822 Biographia Curiosa; or Memoirs of Remarkable Characters of the Reign of George III, with their Portraits (London; with 39 portraits, and a plate of the Beggars' Opera at St. Giles). From 1825, he published four volumes of The Unique, a series of engraved portraits of eminent persons, with brief memoirs. In 1828 he issued Doings in London: or Day and Night Scenes of the Frauds, Frolics, Manners, and Depravities of the Metropolis, illustrated with designs engraved by George Wilmot Bonner after Isaac Robert Cruikshank.

aVEuplerinae, more commonly known as malagasy civets, is a subfamily of carnivorans that includes four species restricted to Madagascar. Together with the subfamily Galidiinae, which also only occurs on Madagascar, it forms the family Eupleridae. Members of this subfamily, which include the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), falanoucs (Eupleres goudotii and Eupleres major) and Malagasy civet (Fossa fossana), were placed in families like Felidae and Viverridae before genetic data indicated their consanguinity with other Madagascar carnivorans. Within the subfamily, the falanouc and Malagasy civet are more closely related to each other than to the fossa.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of mammals of Madagascar\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Psychedelic Supermarket was an underground music venue in Boston, Massachusetts, that was open in the 1960s, and became one of the core establishments of the city's psychedelic rock scene. It stood at 590 Commonwealth Avenue inside a parking garage that was converted into a club by promoter George Popadopolis in 1967. The Psychedelic Supermarket was active for two years, before its closing.\u000aThe venue was established in August 1967 by promoter George Popadopolis. Popadopolis, who was already an owner of a popular Boston-based folk club called the Unicorn, hastily put together the Psychedelic Supermarket in an abandoned parking garage to cash in on the scheduled performances dropped by the Crosstown Bus after it was shut down by police. On September 8, 1967, the Supermarket opened to an eight-day stay by Cream, just as the psychedelic rock group was preparing to record their second album Disraeli Gears. Cream utilized this time to practice their new material, including "Sunshine of Your Love" and "Strange Brew", before showcasing themselves to a national audience.\u000aHowever, for what it offered with major musical acts, the Psychedelic Supermarket's greatest shortcoming was its need of renovation and refurbishing. The venue was described as a "very industrial place" that had walls littered with album covers, no windows, and could hold between 200 and 300 patrons, but in its beginning stages the Supermarket had no seats installed. Perhaps the only positive of being situated in a parking lot was the elevated ceiling which allowed for more lucrative light shows. Throughout its existence, the venue featured a mixture of nationally recognized acts such as the Grateful Dead, Moby Grape, and Country Joe and the Fish, and local Boston bands like Eden's Children, the Freeborne, and Listening.\u000aIn 1969, Popadopolis closed the original site of the Unicorn and moved its operations into the Psychedelic Supermarket. The venue did not stay open for too long thereafter as Boston's psychedelic rock scene, also known as the Bosstown Sound, was on a decline. The building was converted into a movie theater known as the Nickelodeon, before being demolished for a science lab for Boston University.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVA.F.C. Liverpool is a semi-professional football club based in Liverpool, England. The club were formed in 2008 by 1,000 supporters of Liverpool Football Club; a not-for-profit organisation, it is run on a one-member, one-vote system. They are currently members of the North West Counties League Premier Division and play at Marine's Rossett Park.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aAfter plans were announced in February 2008, A.F.C Liverpool were established by Alun Parry in March 2008 for Liverpool fans who had been priced out of Premier League football, adopting the same colours as Liverpool. The new club applied to enter Division Two of the North West Counties League for the 2008\u201309 season, with their place in the now-renamed Division One confirmed in June. They also agreed a groundshare with Prescot Cables to play at Valerie Park. By mid-July the club had attracted around 1,000 members.\u000aThe club played their first match on 16 July, a friendly against St Helens Town at Ashton Town's Edge Street. In front of a crowd of around 600, the game ended in a 1\u20131 draw, with Martin Crowder scoring A.F.C. Liverpool's first-ever goal. The club's first league match on 9 August saw them beat Darwen 5\u20130. Their first season saw the club win the Division One Trophy with a 1\u20130 win over Padiham, whilst they finished fourth in the league, missing out on promotion by four points.\u000aIn 2009\u201310 the club finished fifth in Division One. They also played in the FA Vase for the first time, losing 2\u20131 at home to Dinnington Town in the second qualifying round. However, they retained the Division One Trophy. In 2010\u201311 the club entered the FA Cup for the first time, losing 4\u20131 at Hemsworth Miners Welfare in the extra-preliminary round. In the league they finished fourth, earning promotion to the Premier Division after Rossendale United were expelled from the league and third-placed Holker Old Boys declined promotion. However, they failed to retain the Division One Trophy, losing 3\u20132 after extra time in the final by Atherton Collieries.\u000aIn 2012\u201313 they reached the final of the Liverpool Senior Cup, losing 4\u20133 on penalties to Bootle after a 1\u20131 draw. Prior to the 2014\u201315 season the club announced that they would be leaving Valerie Park and playing at Rossett Park in Crosby.

During the 19th century, it was "one of the best known and most noted institutions of its kind in the state".\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe Washington Female Seminary was part of a larger Female seminary movement. Creation of this particular institution began in 1835 and the Seminary opened 1 year later in 1836. The two founders were abolitionist Francis Julius LeMoyne and Alexander Reed.\u000aIt was formally chartered by the legislature in 1839. The first principal was Mrs. Francis Biddle of Philadelphia, who left in 1840. Sarah B. Hanna (a student of Emma Willard) was Principal from 1840-1874. Miss Nancy Sherrard followed as Principal.\u000aBy 1886, attendance hovered around 100 to 150 students. The curriculum included both a preparatory course, which generally gained admission to the finest women's colleges, and a regular course, with studies in music, art, and elocution. It was one of the few schools that taught the Bible from a literary point of view.\u000aRebecca Harding Davis, who graduated in 1848, is its most famous graduate. In April 2013, a historical marker in Davis' honor was placed near Swanson Science Center, the site of the former McIlvaine Hall/Washington Female Seminary. The effort to place the marker there was led by Washington & Jefferson College English professor, Dr. Jennifer Harding.\u000aJohn Leighton Stewart served as a trustee.\u000aAfter the Seminary closed, its building was purchased by Washington & Jefferson College and renamed McIlvaine Hall.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Gallery ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aFemale seminary\u000aFemale education in the United States\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aCreigh, Alfred (1871).

aVLens (French pronunciation: [l\u0251\u0303s] ( listen); Picard: Linse) is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in northern France. It is one of the main towns of Hauts-de-France along with Lille, Valenciennes, Amiens, Roubaix, Tourcoing, Arras and Douai. The inhabitants are called Lensois.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Metropolitan area ==\u000aLens belongs to the intercommunality of Lens-Liévin, which consists of 36 communes, with a total population of 250,000. Lens, along with Douai, forms the metropolitan area of Douai-Lens, whose population at the 1999 census was 552,682.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aLens was initially a fortification from the Norman invasions. In 1180, it was owned by the Count of Flanders, and sovereignty was exercised by the Crown of France. In the 13th century, Lens received a charter from Louis VIII of France, allowing it to become a city. The Flemish razed the city in 1303. Prior to this, the city's population relied on its markets. In 1526, Lens was made part of the Spanish Netherlands under the ownership of the French monarchy, and only passed back to France on 7 November 1659 with the Treaty of the Pyrenees.\u000aIn 1849, coal was discovered in Lens after surveys were carried out at Annay, Courrières and Loos-en-Gohelle. This led to the expansion of the city into an important industrial center. The Lens Mining Company was founded in 1852 and experienced large profits. The city was largely destroyed in the First World War and half of the population perished. The Gare de Lens railway station, built in 1927, is served by regional trains towards Lille, Arras, Douai, Dunkirk, Calais and Valenciennes. In World War II, the Allies bombarded the city from the air, leaving 500 dead.\u000aApproximately nine kilometres from Lens, the Canadian National Vimy Memorial was opened in 1936, dedicated to the Battle of Vimy Ridge (part of the Battle of Arras) and the First World War Canadian soldiers who lost their lives during the war; the Memorial is also the site of two Canadian cemeteries. The centennial commemoration of the Battle of Vimy Ridge was held at the Memorial on 9 April 2017. The official ceremony included comments from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Governor General David Johnston as representative of the Monarchy of Canada, Prince Charles as representative of the Monarchy of the United Kingdom, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, Prince Harry, the President of France François Hollande, and the Prime Minister of France Bernard Cazeneuve.\u000aThe last coal mine in Lens closed in 1986. Since 2012, Lens has been the location of the Louvre-Lens art museum.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Transport ==\u000aLens is connected to the TGV network, with high speed trains to Paris.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sport ==\u000aSoccer club RC Lens plays in the town.

aVLucius Carvilius was tribune of the people at Rome in 212 BC. Together with Spurius Carvilius, perhaps his brother, he proposed that a fine of 200,000 asses be levied against Marcus Postumius Pyrgensis, for defrauding the state. Postumius was one of the "farmers of the taxes", who made their living shipping goods to Roman forces overseas during the Second Punic War. He made a habit of sabotaging his own shipments and claiming losses from these and other imaginary shipwrecks, for which he was re-imbursed by the state.\u000aAfter Postumius' trial nearly escalated into a riot between the people and his supporters, the Carvilii brought capital charges before the Senate. Postumius gave surety and chose to go into exile rather than appear in person, and many of his supporters likewise chose exile over imprisonment. In this way, Spurius and Lucius Carvilius were able to halt this pernicious drain on the treasury during a critical point in the war.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aCarvilia (gens)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Footnotes ==\u000a\u000a This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.

aVThe Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association (M.E.B.A.) is the oldest maritime trade union in the United States still currently in existence, established in 1875. M.E.B.A. primarily represents licensed mariners, especially deck and engine officers working in the United States Merchant Marine aboard U.S.-flagged vessels. It is a member union of the AFL\u2013CIO.\u000aM.E.B.A. officers work in both the oceans and the Great Lakes in many settings, including on container ships, tankers (including LNG carriers), cruise ships, drillships, tugboats and ferries, as well as in various capacities in the shoreside ship transport and marine industries and on government-contracted ships of the U.S. Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force and U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command. Merchant mariners deliver critical defense cargo to United States armed forces in times of military conflict.\u000aMembers and their families benefit from M.E.B.A.'s collective bargaining agreements through the union's Medical Plan, 401(k) Plan, Pension Trust, and Vacation Plan. The M.E.B.A.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe nation's oldest maritime union was formed out of necessity in the late 19th century. Steamship owners on the Mississippi and Great Lakes were competing with one another and demanding greater speeds from their vessels. This increase in speed greatly reduced safety in the engine room due to fires and boiler explosions. Even with increased risk, the wages remained the same.\u000aIn 1874, the Buffalo Association of Engineers began corresponding with other marine engineer associations around the country. In February 1875, the leaders of five steamship unions out of Buffalo, New York, Cleveland, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, Chicago, Illinois and Baltimore, Maryland, convened in Cleveland, Ohio to join together. This organization called itself the National Marine Engineers Association and chose Garret Douw of Buffalo as its president. (The word Beneficial was not added until 1883.)\u000aAfter Marine Engineers\u2019 Beneficial Association\u2019s formation, the union lobbied Washington legislators to pass bills in 1884 and 1896 that would make it law for all American vessels to only possess American officers, and to grant the ability for marine engineers to attain licenses, respectably. During World War 1, the need for more engineers called for the U.S. government to quickly train marine engineers, however, after the war, such practices continued, and on January 20, 1919, the Marine Engineers\u2019 Beneficial Association agreed to petition the use of "30 day engineers", believing there are enough resources to properly train the next generation of merchant marines. The Marine Engineers\u2019 Beneficial Association, as did a wide variety of worker unions, supplied labor during World War II for both naval and engineering spectrum. M.E.B.A.'s membership, like that of all American maritime unions has varied widely over the years. At the end of World War I, they had more than 22,000 members, but by 1934, their membership was down to 4,848. Membership ballooned during World War II, with job opportunities for about 200,000 seamen.\u000aFollowing the establishment of the U.S. Naval Academy in the 1800s, the Marine Engineers\u2019 Beneficial Association established the Calhoon Marine Engineers\u2019 Beneficial Association Engineering School in 1966 in the Southern Hotel, Baltimore, Maryland. The maritime school offers over fifty courses to union members and outside engineering professionals (as of May 1, 2007) and provides living arrangements for attendees.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Presidents ==\u000a1875 : Garret Douw\u000a1876-1881 : Abner L.

Members of the Marine Engineers\u2019 Beneficial Association have the right to join and affiliate with any union or labor group as they please without any economic or legal repercussions. Members of MEBA have the right to petition and bargain for higher wages under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. Any member of MEBA may remove themselves from the union as they so desire and cannot be forced involuntarily to give money to the Marine Engineers\u2019 Beneficial Association. MEBA employees are required to openly communicate with union officials and the outside employer of the union member. If a MEBA member is working for an employer, the employer must communicate with the Union leadership at all times and offer the employee any promotion he/she rightfully deserves. If a MEBA employee is accused of a crime by an employer, the employee has the right to know any and all evidence and any incident must be one where the security and safety of the vessel was compromised. Even if the MEBA member is found guilty, the information on that occurrence cannot be used against them after two years for another similar occurrence. MEBA members are to be officially considered on duty until they are no longer expected to be continuously active throughout the day. During a period of negotiation, the MEBA member will not face any form of discrimination from the employer. MEBA employees will be required to only work a forty-hour work week, lasting throughout the weekdays. chief engineers who are part of MEBA will receive the same pay as day workers unless the ship is in port, in which case they will be paid on an hourly bases. If the chief engineer is forced to work more than eight hours a day, they will be paid overtime, as well as any work performed on the weekend. Any employee from MEBA working on New Year\u2019s Day, Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Veterans Day, Columbus Day, Thanksgiving Day, or Christmas Day will be paid overtime. Members can post bulletin boards on their vessels as long as the language posted is not vulgar. Any member of M.E.B.A. that believes that he or she has been a victim of a breach in contract or has evidence that their rights of as a union member have not been upheld, they have two weeks after the occurrence of such act to submit their complaints to the captain of the ship.\u000a\u000a\u000a== M.E.B.A. Rights as a Union ==\u000aThe leadership of MEBA cannot be ordered to hire a certain number of engineers or perform specific security measures by the United States Government. The organization of MEBA may fire any personnel and use any form of technology to perform their business. The union leadership of MEBA must recognize all member when speaking for their grievances and will not discriminate against any member for any reason. MEBA must hold a hearing officially stating the conditions of the unions and discuss matter of commerce, security, safety, recruitment and promotions. On every ship in which there is a union member working aboard, the Marine Engineers\u2019 Beneficial Association will appoint one member on the ship as a representative of all those on board. Union officials will meet periodically with members on board vessels without docking the employees\u2019 pay, the location of such meeting is decided by the first mate of the vessel. Any disagreements between MEBA officials and the employer must be handled in a way that will not affect the working order of the union members and their time at sea.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aInternational Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots\u000aSeafarers International Union of North America\u000aNational Maritime Union\u000aThe Maritime Trades Department AFL-CIO\u000aUnited States Merchant Marine\u000aUnited States Maritime Administration\u000aAmerican Bureau of Shipping\u000aInternational Maritime Organization\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aM.E.B.A. Website\u000aM.E.B.A. Plans\u000aMarine Engineers, from the Waterfront Workers History Project\u000aCalhoon M.E.B.A. Engineering School\u000aState Maritime Academies\u000aElection contributions at OpenSecrets\u000aM.E.B.A. on Facebook\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Archives ===\u000aNational Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association Records. 1926-1939. 10 cubic feet.

aVJeff Pollack is an American music and media expert and producer. He is currently the CEO of Pollack Media Group, which is an international media + music consultancy that specializes in connecting content and distribution partners with consumers. Pollack Media has experience on every continent in television, music, live events, artist strategy, film, radio, print, and digital media.\u000aAs a program director, Pollack was instrumental in resuscitaing the long suffering WMMR, transforming "the troubled station into a rating winner and made a name for himself across the country." In an interview with WYSP, Howard Stern eulogized the glory days of Philadelphia's FM stations. During the interview, Stern named Pollack as one of the many legends of WMMR.\u000aIn 1981, Pollack went on to create his own company, which has grown to include clients as diverse as MTV, VH1, CMT, Shazam, Spotify, SFX Entertainment, Delta Air Lines and Smithsonian.\u000aAs a producer, Pollack has participated in some of the largest music and charity events of the past decade including U2/Green Day's Music Rising performance at the NFL's reopening game at the Superdome, Live 8, Live Aid, Live Earth, Movies Rock (Emmy-winner), the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, the 70th Anniversary of the Apollo, and many others.\u000aJeff served as creative music consultant for the MGM TV series Fame L.A., which garnered an Emmy Award nomination for its theme song; on-air music correspondent for Good Morning America; executive music consultant on Pavorotti's televised concert event for Bosnian war victims featuring U2 and others; co-producer of NetAid, the largest Internet event in history at the time; executive producer of Quincy Jones' Lincoln Memorial pre-inauguration event, "Call to Reunion" on HBO; co-executive producer of Billboard Music Awards honoring George Harrison; executive producer of Love Rocks; EIF's Humanitarian Award honoring Bono, with performances from No Doubt, Lauryn Hill, R.E.M., Cher, Drew Carey, Ray Romano, Kevin Nealon, plus guest appearances from Tom Cruise and Kevin Spacey.\u000aAs a music supervisor, Pollack has worked on over thirty films, five of which received Academy Award nominations for Best Original Song, with Crazy Heart's "The Weary Kind" winning the Oscar.\u000aHe also is one of the founders of the Big Bang Conference, a gathering of industry leaders focusing on the latest developments in the digital media and music space. Past speakers have included Eddie Moretti (Vice Media), Jason Hirschhorn, Brian David Johnson (Intel), David Jones (Shazam), and Thomas Goetz (Wired).\u000aIn a Yale Daily News interview, Pollack reflected on his beginnings in the industry stating: "I got into the business because I love music and I had to learn early on that there was a difference between what I liked and what was going to be popular."\u000aPollack was a guest lecturer at Yale University's 2011 Master's Tea, where he discussed his recent Huffington Post contribution entitled: "10 Bands That Shook the World". In it, Pollack lists the bands that "either pioneered or popularized" music for an entire generation. U2, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Grateful Dead were among those mentioned. The list sparked a slew of debates as to what bands truly left a lasting mark on society. "It's not like it's only my opinion that matters \u2014 it's there to invite debate," Pollack remarked.\u000aPollack is also a frequent contributor to The Huffington Post. In his blogs, Pollack gives insight on the ever fluctuating music industry, reviews new music, and highlights upcoming concerts with his "Live & Dangerous" series.\u000aPollack joined his music industry peers in lamenting the loss of Apple CEO Steve Jobs. Pollack was quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying "[Jobs] took the music business away from the labels and focused on the user's experience."\u000aJeff was a producer on the Emmy-nominated HBO film about Frank Sinatra 'All or Nothing At All'. He also served as an associate producer and music supervisor  on the film Glen Campbell "I'll Be Me", which featured two Grammy winning songs, including "I'm Not Going to Miss You\u201d which was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Song.

aVMarsh Stream Farm is a historic coastal farm property at 38 Marsh Stream Lane in Machiasport, Maine. Established in 1817, the property was used for sheep farming, a once-common occupation in coastal Maine, until 1987. It has a well-preserved collection of 19th-century farm buildings, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Description ==\u000aMarsh Stream Farm is located in a rural area of central western Machiasport, on the south side of East Kennebec Road. The farm occupies more than 200 acres (81 ha) of land between that road and the eastern branch of the Little Kennebec Bay, bounded on the east by Manchester Lane and roughly on the west by Marsh Stream Lane. The main farm complex is set amid fields a short way south of East Kennebec Road, at the mouth of Marsh Stream. It includes a c. 1817 farmhouse, a 19th-century English barn, and a number of other 19th and 20th-century outbuildings. About 3/4 of the farm property is wooded, the remainder is maintained as pasture.\u000aThe main house, oriented facing south toward the stream and the bay, is a 1-1/2 story Cape style wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a gabled roof, two small center chimneys, and clapboard siding. Each roof face has a gabled dormer. The original front door is framed by narrow pilasters and topped by a four-light transom window. Some of the interior rooms have retained significant original finishes from the period of construction.\u000aLand for the farm was purchased in 1814 by William Holway, a native of Machias. By 1817 he had built the house, as well as a wharf and store (now only ruins remaining) on the bay. Holway raised sheep on the farm, a practice that would continue by following owners until 2003. The English barn, a well-preserved 19th-century structure, has modifications diverging from the typical form that are specific to the practice of sheep farming, and is an extremely rare example of this type of structure in Maine, which was once much more common.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aNational Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Maine\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVManganese(IV) oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula MnO\u000a2. This blackish or brown solid occurs naturally as the mineral pyrolusite, which is the main ore of manganese and a component of manganese nodules. The principal use for MnO\u000a2 is for dry-cell batteries, such as the alkaline battery and the zinc-carbon battery. MnO\u000a2 is also used as a pigment and as a precursor to other manganese compounds, such as KMnO\u000a4. It is used as a reagent in organic synthesis, for example, for the oxidation of allylic alcohols. MnO\u000a2 in the \u03b1 polymorph can incorporate a variety of atoms (as well as water molecules) in the "tunnels" or "channels" between the manganese oxide octahedra. There is considerable interest in \u03b1-MnO\u000a2 as a possible cathode for lithium ion batteries.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Structure ==\u000aSeveral polymorphs of MnO\u000a2 are claimed, as well as a hydrated form. Like many other dioxides, MnO\u000a2 crystallizes in the rutile crystal structure (this polymorph is called \u03b2-MnO\u000a2), with three-coordinate oxide and octahedral metal centres. MnO\u000a2 is characteristically nonstoichiometric, being deficient in oxygen. The complicated solid-state chemistry of this material is relevant to the lore of "freshly prepared" MnO\u000a2 in organic synthesis. The \u03b1-polymorph of MnO\u000a2 has a very open structure with "channels" which can accommodate metal atoms such as silver or barium. \u03b1-MnO\u000a2 is often called Hollandite, after a closely related mineral.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production ==\u000aNaturally occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities and a considerable amount of manganese(III) oxide. Only a limited number of deposits contain the \u03b3 modification in purity sufficient for the battery industry.\u000aProduction of batteries and ferrite (two of the primary uses of manganese dioxide) requires high purity manganese dioxide. Batteries require "electrolytic manganese dioxide" while ferrites require "chemical manganese dioxide".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Chemical manganese dioxide ===\u000aOne method starts with natural manganese dioxide and converts it using dinitrogen tetroxide and water to a manganese(II) nitrate solution. Evaporation of the water, leaves the crystalline nitrate salt. At temperatures of 400 °C, the salt decomposes, releasing N\u000a2O\u000a4 and leaving a residue of purified manganese dioxide. These two steps can be summarized as:\u000aMnO\u000a2 + N\u000a2O\u000a4 \u21cc Mn(NO\u000a3)\u000a2\u000aIn another process manganese dioxide is carbothermically reduced to manganese(II) oxide which is dissolved in sulfuric acid. The filtered solution is treated with ammonium carbonate to precipitate MnCO\u000a3. The carbonate is calcined in air to give a mixture of manganese(II) and manganese(IV) oxides. To complete the process, a suspension of this material in sulfuric acid is treated with sodium chlorate. Chloric acid, which forms in situ, converts any Mn(III) and Mn(II) oxides to the dioxide, releasing chlorine as a by-product.\u000aA third process involves manganese heptoxide and manganese monoxide. The two reagents combine with a 1:3 ratio to form manganese dioxide:\u000aMn\u000a2O\u000a7 + 3 MnO \u2192 5 MnO\u000a2\u000aLastly the action of potassium permanganate over manganese sulphate crystals produces the desired oxide.\u000a2 KMnO\u000a4 + 3 MnSO\u000a4 + 2 H\u000a2O\u2192 5 MnO\u000a2 + K\u000a2SO\u000a4 + 2 H\u000a2SO\u000a4\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Electrolytic manganese dioxide ===\u000aElectrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) is used in zinc\u2013carbon batteries together with zinc chloride and ammonium chloride. EMD is commonly used in zinc manganese dioxide rechargeable alkaline (Zn RAM) cells also. For these applications, purity is extremely important. EMD is produced in a similar fashion as electrolytic tough pitch (ETP) copper: The manganese dioxide is dissolved in sulfuric acid (sometimes mixed with manganese sulfate) and subjected to a current between two electrodes. The MnO2 dissolves, enters solution as the sulfate, and is deposited on the anode.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reactions ==\u000aThe important reactions of MnO\u000a2 are associated with its redox, both oxidation and reduction.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Reduction ===\u000aMnO\u000a2 is the principal precursor to ferromanganese and related alloys, which are widely used in the steel industry. The conversions involve carbothermal reduction using coke:\u000aMnO\u000a2 + 2 C \u2192 Mn + 2 CO\u000aThe key reactions of MnO\u000a2 in batteries is the one-electron reduction:\u000aMnO\u000a2 + e\u2212 + H+ \u2192 MnO(OH)\u000aMnO\u000a2 catalyses several reactions that form O\u000a2. In a classical laboratory demonstration, heating a mixture of potassium chlorate and manganese dioxide produces oxygen gas. Manganese dioxide also catalyses the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water:\u000a2 H\u000a2O\u000a2 \u2192 2 H\u000a2O + O\u000a2\u000aManganese dioxide decomposes above about 530 °C to manganese(III) oxide and oxygen. At temperatures close to 1000 °C, the mixed-valence compound Mn\u000a3O\u000a4 forms. Higher temperatures give MnO.\u000aHot concentrated sulfuric acid reduces the MnO\u000a2 to manganese(II) sulfate:\u000a2 MnO\u000a2 + 2 H\u000a2SO\u000a4 \u2192 2 MnSO\u000a4 + O\u000a2 + 2 H\u000a2O\u000aThe reaction of hydrogen chloride with MnO\u000a2 was used by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in the original isolation of chlorine gas in 1774:\u000aMnO\u000a2 + 4 HCl \u2192 MnCl\u000a2 + Cl\u000a2 + 2 H\u000a2O\u000aAs a source of hydrogen chloride, Scheele treated sodium chloride with concentrated sulfuric acid.\u000a\u000aEo (MnO\u000a2(s) + 4\u200aH+ + 2\u200ae\u2212 \u21cc Mn2+ + 2 H\u000a2O) = +1.23 V\u000aEo (Cl\u000a2(g) + 2\u200ae\u2212 \u21cc 2\u200aCl\u2212) = +1.36 V\u000a\u000aThe standard electrode potentials for the half reactions indicate that the reaction is endothermic at pH = 0 (1 M [H+]), but it is favoured by the lower pH as well as the evolution (and removal) of gaseous chlorine.\u000aThis reaction is also a convenient way to remove the manganese dioxide precipitate from the ground glass joints after running a reaction (i. e., an oxidation with potassium permanganate).\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Oxidation ===\u000aHeating a mixture of KOH and MnO\u000a2 in air gives green potassium manganate:\u000a2 MnO\u000a2 + 4 KOH + O\u000a2 \u2192 2 K\u000a2MnO\u000a4 + 2 H\u000a2O\u000aPotassium manganate is the precursor to potassium permanganate, a common oxidant.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Applications ==\u000aThe predominant application of MnO\u000a2 is as a component of dry cell batteries, so called Leclanché cell, or zinc\u2013carbon batteries. Approximately 500,000 tonnes are consumed for this application annually. Other industrial applications include the use of MnO\u000a2 as an inorganic pigment in ceramics and in glassmaking.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Organic synthesis ===\u000aA specialized use of manganese dioxide is as oxidant in organic synthesis. The effectiveness of the reagent depends on the method of preparation, a problem that is typical for other heterogeneous reagents where surface area, among other variables, is a significant factor. The mineral pyrolusite makes a poor reagent. Usually, however, the reagent is generated in situ by treatment of an aqueous solution KMnO\u000a4 with a Mn(II) salt, typically the sulfate. MnO\u000a2 oxidizes allylic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes or ketones:\u000a\u000acis-RCH=CHCH\u000a2OH + MnO\u000a2 \u2192 cis-RCH=CHCHO + MnO + H\u000a2O\u000a\u000aThe configuration of the double bond is conserved in the reaction. The corresponding acetylenic alcohols are also suitable substrates, although the resulting propargylic aldehydes can be quite reactive. Benzylic and even unactivated alcohols are also good substrates. 1,2-Diols are cleaved by MnO\u000a2 to dialdehydes or diketones. Otherwise, the applications of MnO\u000a2 are numerous, being applicable to many kinds of reactions including amine oxidation, aromatization, oxidative coupling, and thiol oxidation.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Pigment ===\u000aManganese dioxide, in the form of umber, was one of the earliest natural substances used by human ancestors. It was used as a pigment at least from the middle paleolithic. It was possibly used first for body painting, and later for cave painting. Some of the most famous early cave paintings in Europe were executed by means of manganese dioxide.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Hazards ==\u000aManganese dioxide can slightly stain human skin if it is damp or in a heterogeneous mixture, but the stains can be washed off quite easily with some rubbing. When dry avoid breathing in fine particles by wearing a simple medical mask or such to avoid damage to lungs.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of inorganic pigments\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aREACH Mn Consortium\u000aIndex of Organic Synthesis procedures utilizing MnO\u000a2\u000aExample Reactions with Mn(IV) oxide\u000aNational Pollutant Inventory - Manganese and compounds Fact Sheet\u000aPubChem summary of MnO\u000a2\u000aInternational Chemical Safety Card 0175\u000aPotters Manganese Toxicity by Elke Blodgett

While \u010celik was not the official successor of Javorak, the initiative to create a club was taken by former Javorak player Savo Pejovi\u0107. Eventually, a potential leader was found in Marko Orovi\u0107 who had a long history of business in football within Nik\u0161i\u0107. The name "\u010celik" was given in memory of Petar Savelji\u0107, who had worked at the local steel mill before playing football with Savo Pejovi\u0107.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aIn their first season, \u010celik played in the Titogradski podsavez - South, which was fourth level in former SFR Yugoslavia. Very soon, \u010celik became regular participant of Montenegrin Republic Football League (third level). First biggest success for \u010celik came at the 1961, when the club from Nik\u0161i\u0107 won the Montenegrin Cup. During the '80s, \u010celik became one of the most successful clubs in Montenegrin Republic Football League, but their first appearances in Yugoslav Second League came during the 90's. At the August 2012, \u010celik played their first match at the First Football League.\u000aThe club's biggest success happened when they won the 2011\u201312 Montenegrin Cup thanks to a 2-1 victory against FK Rudar Pljevlja despite still playing in the Montenegrin Second League that season. Winning the cup allowed the club to enter the 2012-13 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase, where they beat Bosnian powerhouse Borac Banja Luka on away goals. Facing Ukrainian club Metalurh Donetsk in the second qualifying round, the team garnered even more attention from the local media as the players and staff traveled from Nik\u0161i\u0107 to Donetsk (2,143 kilometers) by bus, which, after being denied entry to Moldova, lasted approximately 70 hours on the road.

aVThe Ford Falcon GT is an automobile produced by Ford Australia from 1967 to 1976 as the performance version of its Falcon model range. Its production was resumed by a joint venture in 1992 and 1997 with Tickford, and between 2003 and 2014 with Prodrive, the latter being marketed as the FPV GT. The Falcon GT is inextricably linked with the history of Australian muscle car production and with the evolution of Australian domestic motor racing.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Overview ==\u000aThe GT model was introduced as a performance variant of the Australian Ford Falcon XR series in 1967. They were also offered with the 1968 XT; 1969 XW, 1971 XY, 1972 XA, 1973 XB Falcon ranges. GT-HO ("Handling Option") versions were released with the XW and XY Falcon series, with were essentially further modified homologation specials for motor racing. An XA series HO was abandoned in the early stage of development due to public pressure in 1972 after an infamous newspaper campaign against excessive top speed.\u000aIn 1992, after a 16-year absence since the last model, the badge resurfaced with the GT 25th Anniversary model based EB II series Falcon, which was followed by a GT 30th Anniversary model in 1997. Both of these cars were developed by Tickford Vehicle Engineering (TVE), which then opted to instead establish the Ford Tickford Experience (FTE) brand as a more sophisticated alternative to high performance rival, Holden Special Vehicles (HSV), by marketing the "T series" based on the AU Falcon and Fairlane range.\u000aFrom 2003, with Tickford bought out by Prodrive, FTE was replaced by the new owner's Ford Performance Vehicles (FPV) joint venture with Ford Australia. This change led to the GT badge becoming a permanent fixture of the Falcon range, with the aim of more closely competing against rival Holden's, HSV. FPV's operations ended in 2014, as part of Ford Australia's end of location production by 2016, with the launch of the last GT-F "351".\u000a\u000a\u000a== XR series ==\u000a\u000aThe 1967 XR series was a major shift in the evolution of the Falcon, then still being adapted from its American counterpart for Australian release. The car was noticeably larger compared to the XP model range. For the first time, Ford Australia offered a V8 engine on the range, the 289-cubic-inch engine then in use on the Ford Mustang.\u000aAustralian Police force took advantage of the option of the powerful V8 engine, with Ford offering a Police Interceptor Pack Falcon, Ford Australia Managing Director, Bill Bourke, then introduced the GT, based around the success of GT versions of the Ford Cortina. The Falcon GT would be marketed in the same way as the Cortina GT with the competition arm of Ford Australia preparing production racing cars to race at the Bathurst 500.\u000aA charcoal interior consisting of ZA Fairlane bucket seats, wood-grained steering wheel, dash, and matching gear knob and special Stewart-Warner instrumentation added to the sporty specification.\u000aThe XR GT was available to the public exclusively with a manual transmission and in the exclusive "GT Gold" paint, with a total of 596 units built. A fleet of eight units was produced in "Gallaher Silver" for promotion of the Gallaher tobacco brand, which had a small keyhole in the right-rear quarter panel under one of the taillights that activated an alarm system connected to the doors and boot. A further five units were also finished in a selection of colors at the request of teams to enter them in racing events, with the 1967 Gallaher 500 winning XR GT painted in Ivy Green.\u000aThe factory racing team, led by veteran driver/engineer Harry Firth entered two cars, one for himself and Fred Gibson and the other for the Geoghegan brothers, Ian and Leo, though both supplied their own pit crew and each 'team' prepared its own car. After a day-long battle against three Alfa Romeos at Bathurst in 1967, the team emerged with a 1\u20132 team victory (with Firth and Gibson winning by 11 seconds) which captured the public imagination and sales figures soared. The move forced General Motors-Holden's and Chrysler Australia to respond with their own performance editions of their large sedan in 1968 when neither had such vehicles planned, beginning the era of the Australian muscle car.\u000a\u000a\u000a== XT series ==\u000a\u000aThe XT Falcon had an increase in capacity of the Windsor V8 to 302 in3. The color range was also increased, and sales doubled the number of the previous range. The XT won the Teams Prize in the 1968 London-Sydney Marathon finishing third, fifth, and eighth in the event, against more rally-focused opposition.\u000a\u000a\u000a== XW series ==\u000a\u000aFord introduced the HO (high output\u2014quite often erroneously referred to as "handling option") package in the 1969 XW model range, creating a two-tier range, with the HO package essentially a road-registerable racing car for the leading production touring car teams to exploit. With the XW range, the Windsor V8 was now offered in a bigger 351 cubic-inch displacement, producing 290 BHP (217 KW) and 385 ft/lb of torque.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== GT-HO ===\u000aThe first GT-HO variant produced 300 bhp (225 KW) due to a larger carburetor, and changes to the camshaft and intake. Changes also were made to the suspension, including stiffer shock absorbers and springs and larger-diameter roll bars. Despite the changes made, at the 1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500 poor tyre performance meant that drivers had to pit regularly over the opposition. However, a privately entered XW GT-HO of Bruce McPhee and Barry Mulholland claimed second outright.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== GT-HO Phase II ===\u000aIn 1970, the Cleveland V8 engine replaced the previous Windsor engines, the 351 cubic-inch Cleveland engine was first used in a small batch of Phase 1 specification XW GT's, these are retrospectively referred to as "Phase 1.5s". Ford modified the engine in the Phase II, with a larger carburetor (700cfm) over the Cleveland's original 600 cfm version. Allan Moffat claimed his first Bathurst win at the hands of a Phase II at the 1970 Hardie-Ferodo 500, with Bruce McPhee second, giving Ford Works Team a 1 - 2 finish.\u000a\u000a\u000a== XY series ==\u000a\u000aAlmost a year after the release of the XY Falcon, Ford released the 1971 XY GT. Among the visual changes to the normal Falcon range, the XY received the "shaker scoop" ram-air intake from the 1969-70 Mach 1 Mustang. An XY GT starred in the Australian movie Running on Empty, as a GT-HO Phase III.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== GT-HO Phase III ===\u000aThe homolgation specials reached their zenith with the Ford Falcon GTHO Phase III in 1971, a car which Allan Moffat used to defeat all opposition in the 1971 Bathurst enduro and remained the fastest four-door production sedan in the world until the introduction of the Lotus Carlton 19 years later, with a 6-cylinder engine.\u000aA fear campaign against the homolgation specials started with headlines of "160 MPH Street Cars Soon!" led to Ford dropping production with the planned Falcon GT HO Phase IV. For their own part, touring car racing regulations were altered, creating the 1973 Group C regulations, which allowed production cars to be modified for racing independently of the road-going cars, reducing pressure on manufacturers to put racing modifications into the road cars.\u000aA Ford Falcon GTHO Phase III was the most expensive Australian vehicle sold at auction, selling for A$750,000. A previous sale had been for A$683,650.\u000a\u000a\u000a== XA series ==\u000a\u000aThe GT model was continued with the new Australian-designed XA, and for the first time, the GT was available as a two-door hardtop. The GT received unique front fenders with dummy air vents on the leading edges, and a bonnet featuring NACA-style ducts. Purchasers were now offered a larger range of colour combinations, with the GT black-outs on the bonnet and lower edges of the car now available in silver.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== GT-HO Phase IV ===\u000a\u000aFord developed the HO series further with the XA Falcon, and were ready to produce the Phase IV to homologate the car for Group E Series Production Touring Cars racing, including the 1972 Hardie-Ferodo 500. On Sunday, 25 June 1972, the front page of the Sun-Herald set off a chain of responses from the Minister for Transport, Milton Morris, who called for the ban of these supercars just three days after the news article.\u000aOn Thursday 29 June, the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS) announced that the end of the current Group E Series Production Touring Cars regulations, which would be replaced by new Group C regulations for 1973. Group C allowed modified versions of road cars to compete, removing the need for manufactures to develop road-going race specials.\u000aThe following Sunday, 2 July, Ford announced the cancellation of the Phase IV program. At this stage, one production car had been sent down the line, and three XA GT sedans were in various stages of construction to Phase IV specs at Ford Special Vehicles, Ford's internal race division. Only one of these cars was ever used in competition, with one sold to rally driver Bruce Hodgson, and eventually was destroyed in a crash in 1981. The car has since been rediscovered and is undergoing restoration.The other two are in the hands of collectors, with the car intended for Allan Moffat now in a Sydney collection and the Gibson car in Qld.News.drive.com.au</ref>\u000aThe sole production car was not sold until the following year, by Jack Brabham Ford, to a Sydney, Australia-based owner, whom then had the car resprayed from its original Calypso Green to Zircon Green. The car went through a number of owners, until the current owner had the car restored to factory specifications, in a build documented by an Australian Fords publication.\u000a\u000a\u000a== XB series ==\u000a\u000aLaunched in September 1973, the XB GT was to be the last Falcon GT for almost 20 years, until the 25th Anniversary EBII GT in October 1992. The XB GT received a new aggressive front end with a twin nostril bonnet, similar to the style found on the '71-'73 Mach 1 Mustang. The XB was the most popular GT model built by Ford with a total of 2,899 (1950 sedans and 949 hardtops) sold. In August 1975, Ford introduced the John Goss Special , a limited-edition hardtop with a unique color scheme and several GT appearance and interior features, to celebrate the fact that Goss was the only driver to win both the Australian Grand Prix and the Bathurst 1000.\u000a\u000a\u000a== EB II and EL series ==\u000a\u000aIn 1991, Ford Australia entered in a joint venture with Tickford, establishing Tickford Vehicle Engineering (TVE) as its high-performance arm. Apart from developing Falcon's XR sports models and fitting certain accessories to the Falcon and Fairlane range (e.g. LPG systems and sunroofs), TVE took advantage of the return of a V8 powerplant since 1982 by releasing "25th Anniversary" and "30th Anniversary" editions of the Falcon GT, based on the EB II series.\u000aThe anniversary years are based from the time of the introduction of the first Falcon GT in 1967 (based on the XR series), and became the first time that a Falcon GT was again available since the last GT of 1973-1976 (based on the XB series). These GTs represented, for the first time, a shift from extreme performance to a refined grand tourer vehicle, as highlighted by their interiors based on the luxury-oriented Fairmont Ghia models.\u000a\u000a\u000a== BA to FG series ==\u000a\u000aAfter FTE's relative lack of success with its AU series-based T-series models sold between 1999 and 2002, the GT nameplate was revived by Ford Performance Vehicles (FPV), a new joint venture between Prodrive and Ford Australia established in 2003. The FPV GT range was thus available with the BA (2002), BF (2006) and FG (2008) series. The FPV model range generally comprised the base GT (whose subsequent derivate GS justified the absence of a Falcon XR8), higher performance and specification GT-P. In 2008, it was expanded with the luxury-oriented variant GT-E, and between 2007 and 2014, the range was also bolstered by various limited editions. Those BF series models included the:\u000aGT "40th Anniversary" (March 2007; 200 sedans, 25 of which were exported to New Zealand) to commemorate the first Falcon GT of 1967; it featured: special interior and colour accents, distinctive 19-inch alloy wheels and "R-Spec" handling package\u000aGT "Cobra" (October 2007; 400 sedans and 100, non-GT, Super Pursuit utes) to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the original Falcon Cobra's 1-2 finish at the 1977 Bathurst 1000; it featured: engine power upgrade from 290 kW to 302 kW and 540 Nm of torque, and "R-Spec" handling package\u000aGT "5th Anniversary" (October 2008; 200 sedans) to commemorate FPV's fifth birthday; launched at the Sydney Motorshow it featured: Lightning Strike (silver) or Silhouette (black) exterior paint with unique striping package, special multi-spoke alloy wheels in Alpine Silver, six piston Brembo brakes and a luxury Nudo leather interior.\u000aLimited editions based on the FPV FG series included the:\u000aGT "Black" (August 2011; 125 sedans) unveiled at Sydney Motorshow  it was available only Silhouette and was completely painted in that colour (including alloy wheels, exhaust tips and exterior trims) with new matte black stripes, and was powered by a Boss 335 5.0-litre V8 supercharged engine with a maximum power output of 335 kW\u000aGT "R-Spec" (August 2012; 350 sedans and 75 utes) unveiled at Sydney Motorshow, it was primarily available in Silhouette and striking red highlights and a "C" stripe down each side, echoing the 2012 Mustang "302 Boss" Laguna Seca, and featured the above V8 supercharged engine, "R-Spec" handling package plus wider (9-inch) rear wheels and launch control and could be optioned with an upgraded Brembo braking system\u000aGT-F "351" (June 2014; 550 sedans and 120 utes) as the "F"inal GT with its "351" badge representing its engine output but also paying tribute to the 351 cubic inch displacement of the engines used in the XW to XB models of the Falcon GT. It inherited the GT R-Spec"'s chassis enhancements and featured black highlights throughout including new matte black stripes.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Model specifications ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ford ===\u000aThese vehicles were built between 1967 and 1976. GT models of either the XC (in lieu, Ford produced the Ford Falcon Cobra range in 1978) or EA were never produced.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Tickford ===\u000a\u000aThese vehicles ended a 16-year absence of the GT nameplate from the Falcon range.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== FPV ===\u000a\u000aFrom 2003, these vehicles marked the return of the GT name, following FTE's unsuccessful attempt to establish its T-series (based on the AU series Falcon) sold between 1999 and 2002.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Motorsport ==\u000a\u000aThe Falcon GT saw considerable success in the Australian Touring Car Championship, Australian Manufacturers' Championship and the Bathurst 500/Bathurst 1000.

aVThe 25th Infantry Division (nicknamed "Tropic Lightning" and the "Electric Strawberry") is a U.S. Army division based in Hawaii. The division, which was activated on 1 October 1941 in Hawaii, conducts military operations in the Asia-Pacific region. Its present deployment is composed of Stryker, light infantry, airborne, and aviation units.\u000aThe 25th Division was formed from the 27th and 35th Infantry regiments of the original Hawaiian Division\u2212 a pre\u2013Second World War "square division" composed of two brigades with four infantry regiments. The remaining units of the Hawaiian Division were reorganized as the 24th Infantry Division. These steps, part of the Triangular division organization, were undertaken to provide more flexibility with direct division control of three regiments.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Lineage ===\u000aSources: \u000aConstituted 26 August 1941 in the Army of the United States as Headquarters, 25th Infantry Division, based on a Cadre Force from the former Hawaiian Division.\u000aActivated 1 October 1941 at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii\u000aAllotted 27 June 1949 to the Regular Army\u000aDivision headquarters reorganized and redesignated 1 April 1960 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 25th Infantry Division\u000aReorganized and redesignated 16 November 2005 as Headquarters and Tactical Command Posts, 25th Infantry Division\u000aReorganized and redesignated 16 January 2010 as Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 25th Infantry Division\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Pacific War ===\u000a\u000aAfter the Japanese air attack on Schofield Barracks, 7 December 1941, the 25th Infantry Division moved to beach positions for the defense of Honolulu and Ewa Point. Following intensive training, the 25th began moving to Guadalcanal, 25 November 1942, to relieve Marines near Henderson Field. First elements landed near the Tenaru River, 17 December 1942, and entered combat, 10 January 1943, participating in the seizure of Kokumbona and the reduction of the Mount Austen Pocket in some of the bitterest fighting of the Pacific campaign. The threat of large enemy attacks caused a temporary withdrawal, but Division elements under XIV Corps control relieved the 147th Infantry and took over the advance on Cape Esperance. The junction of these elements with Americal Division forces near the cape, 5 February 1943, ended organized enemy resistance.\u000aA period of garrison duty followed, ending 21 July: On that date, advance elements debarked on Munda, New Georgia. The 25th Infantry, under the Northern Landing Force, took part in the capture of Vella Lavella, 15 August to 15 September 1943. Meanwhile, other elements landed on New Georgia, took Zieta, marched through jungle mud for 19 days, and captured Bairoko Harbor, winning the island. Elements cleared Arundel Island, 24 September 1943, and Kolombangara island with its important Vila Airport, 6 October. Organized resistance on New Georgia ended, 25 August, and the division moved to New Zealand for rest and training, last elements arriving on 5 December. The 25th was transferred to New Caledonia, 3 February-14 March 1944, for continued training.\u000aThe division landed in the San Fabian area of Luzon on 11 January 1945 to enter the struggle for the liberation of the Philippines. It drove across the Luzon Central Plain, meeting the enemy at Binalonan, 17 January. Moving through the rice paddies, the 25th occupied Umingan, Lupao, and San Jose and destroyed a great part of the Japanese armor on Luzon. On 21 February, the division began operations in the Caraballo Mountains. It fought its way along Highway No. 5, taking Digdig, Putlan, and Kapintalan against fierce enemy counterattacks and took Balete Pass, 13 May, and opened the gateway to the Cagayan Valley, 27 May, with the capture of Santa Fe. Until 30 June, when the division was relieved, it carried out mopping-up activities. On 1 July, the division moved to Tarlac for training, leaving for Japan, 20 September.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Casualties ====\u000aTotal battle casualties: 5,432\u000aKilled in action: 1,235\u000aWounded in action: 4,190\u000aMissing in action: 5\u000aPrisoner of war: 2\u000aThe division's rapid movements during its campaigns led to the adoption of the nickname "Tropic Lightning". It remained on occupation duty in Japan for the next five years.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Korean War ===\u000a\u000aOpen warfare once again flared in Asia, now the division's primary area of concern, on 25 June 1950. The North Korean military crossed the 38th parallel on that day in an attack on South Korea. Acting under United Nations orders, the Tropic Lightning Division moved from its base in Japan to Korea between 5\u201318 July 1950. The division, then under the command of Major General William B. Kean, successfully completed its first mission by blocking the approaches to the port city Pusan. For this action, the Tropic Lightning received its first Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. But other battles later in the conflict further enhanced the division's reputation for exceptional combat effectiveness. The division participated in the break-out from the Pusan perimeter and the successful drive into North Korea in October 1950. Task Force Dolvin, the 89th Tank Battalion under LTC Dolvin on 24 November and together these units successfully drove the enemy to the Yalu River. In a sudden and unexpected reversal, however, an overwhelming number of Chinese Communist troops crossed the Yalu and pushed back United Nations forces all along the front. The division was forced to carry out a systematic withdrawal and ordered to take up defensive positions on the south bank of the Chongchon River 30 November 1950. Eventually, these lines failed. However, after a series of short withdrawals a permanent battle line was established south of Osan.\u000aAfter a month and a half of planning and reorganization, a new offensive was launched 15 January 1951, and was successfully completed by 10 February with the recapture of Inchon and Kimpo Air Base. This was the first of several successful assaults on the Chinese/North Korean force, which helped turn the tide in the United Nations' favor. The division next participated in Operation Ripper, during which it drove the enemy across the Han River. Success continued with Operation Dauntless, Detonate and Piledriver in the Spring of 1951. These offensives secured part of the famous Iron Triangle which enhanced the United Nations' bargaining platform. With leaders of four nations now at the negotiating tables in the summer of 1951, Division activity slowed to patrol and defensive actions to maintain the line of resistance. This type of action continued into the winter of 1952. When negotiations stalled, the division assumed the responsibility of guarding the approaches of Seoul on 5 May 1953. 23 days later, a heavy Chinese assault was hurled at it. The division held its ground and the assault was repulsed; the brunt of the attack was absorbed by the 14th Infantry Regiment ("Golden Dragons"). By successfully defending Seoul from continued attack from May to July 1953, the division earned its second Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. Again negotiators moved toward peace. In July, the division again moved to reserve status at Camp Casey where it remained through the signing of the armistice 27 July 1953. Fourteen division soldiers were awarded Medals of Honor during the Korean War, making the division one of the most decorated US Army divisions of that war.\u000aThe division's 14th Infantry Regiment had three recipients of the Medal of Honor, Donn F. Porter, Ernest E. West and Bryant E. Womack. The 24th Infantry Regiment had two recipients, Cornelius H. Charlton and William Thompson. The 35th Infantry Regiment had three recipients, William R. Jecelin, Billie G. Kanell and Donald R. Moyer. Finally, the 27th Infantry Regiment had five recipients, John W. Collier, Reginald B. Desiderio, Benito Martinez, Lewis L. Millett and Jerome A. Sudut. The divisions patch is sometimes referred to as the "Electric Strawberry".\u000aThe division remained in Korea until 1954 and returned to Hawaii from September through October of that year. After a 12-year absence, the 25th Infantry Division had finally returned home.\u000a\u000aOn 1 February 1957, the division was reorganized as a Pentomic Division. The division\u2019s three infantry regiments (the 14th, 27th and 35th) were inactivated, with their elements reorganized into five infantry battle groups (the 1-14 IN, 1-27 IN, 1-35 IN, 2-19 IN and the 2-21 IN).\u000aIn August 1963, the division was reorganized as a Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD). Three Brigade Headquarters were activated and Infantry units were reorganized into battalions.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Vietnam War ===\u000a\u000aIn response to a request from the U.S. Military Assistance Command in Vietnam, the division sent 100 helicopter door-gunners to South Vietnam in early 1963. By August 1965, further division involvement in the coming Vietnam War included the deployment of Company C, 65th Engineer Battalion, to South Vietnam to assist in the construction of port facilities at Cam Ranh Bay. By mid-1965, 2,200 men of the Tropic Lightning Division were involved in Vietnam. The division was again ordered to contribute combat forces in December of that year. Its resupply regiment, the 467th, was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George S Dotson through the end of the war.\u000aIn response to a MACV request, the division deployed the 3rd Brigade, a Reinforced Task Force, with 5,150 infantrymen and 9,000 tons of equipment from Hawaii in 25 days to the Northwest sector of South Vietnam to firmly establish a fortified enclave from which the division could operate. Operation Blue Light was the largest and longest airlift of personnel and cargo into a combat zone in military history before Operation Desert Shield. The brigade deployed its first soldiers from Hickam Air Force Base, Honolulu, to the central highlands at Pleiku. These men arrived in Vietnam 24 December 1965. By mid-January, the deployment operation was complete \u2014 giving combat planners in Vietnam a favorable balance of power. The division was heavily engaged from April 1966 until 1972 throughout the area of operations in Southeast Asia. During this period, Tropic Lightning soldiers fought in some of the toughest battles of the war including Operation Junction City.\u000aDuring the Tet offensives of 1968 and 1969, Tropic Lightning soldiers were instrumental in defending the besieged city of Saigon. From May through June 1970, division soldiers participated in Allied thrusts deep into enemy sanctuaries located in Cambodia. In these Incursion operations, the division units confiscated thousands of tons of supplies and hundreds of weapons. This operation crippled the Cambodian-based efforts against American units. Following its return from Cambodia to South Vietnam, the division resumed its place in the Vietnamization Program. The war was winding down. By late December 1970, elements of the 25th Infantry Division were able to begin redeployment to Schofield Barracks. Second Brigade was the last element of the division to depart Vietnam. It arrived at Ft Lewis, Washington in the early days of May 1971. Some elements in the 2nd Brigade were originally assigned to the 4th Infantry Division when they arrived in Vietnam. During the war in Vietnam, 22 Medals of Honor were awarded to Tropic Lightning soldiers.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Reorganization and light infantry status ===\u000aAfter its return to Schofield Barracks, the 25th Infantry Division remained the only Army division to have never been on the mainland. In a time of overall military downsizing, it was reduced to a single brigade numbering 4,000 men. The division was reactivated in March 1972. It was reorganized to include as a "roundout" brigade the 29th Infantry Brigade of the Hawaii Army National Guard which included: the 2nd Battalion, 299th Infantry, Hawaii Army National Guard; 100th Battalion, 442d Infantry, US Army Reserve; and the 1st Battalion, 184th Infantry California Army National Guard. Now reorganized, the 25th Infantry Division trained for the next eight years throughout the Pacific Theater and continued to improve its combat capabilities with troop deployment varying in size from squads, who participated in training missions with Fijian forces, to exercises as large as Team Spirit, where more than 5,000 divisional troops and 1,700 pieces of equipment were airlifted to South Korea for this annual exercise.\u000a\u000aIn 1985, the division began its reorganization from a conventional infantry division to a light infantry division. The four primary characteristics of this new light infantry division were to be: mission flexibility, rapid deployment and combat readiness at 100 percent strength with a Pacific Basin orientation. Major configuration changes included the addition of a third infantry brigade, an additional direct-support artillery battalion and the expansion of the combat aviation battalion to a brigade-sized unit. With the transfer of large quantities of heavy equipment, the 25th Infantry Division earned the designation "light" \u2014 the reorganization was completed by 1 October 1986. Training became more sophisticated and more intense. In 1988, the division's first battalions participated in rotations at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. This training center provides the most realistic training available to light forces in the Army. Coupled with joint/combined training exercises Cobra Gold in Thailand, Kangaroo in Australia and Orient Shield in Japan, the division's demanding exercise schedule significantly increased the division's fighting capabilities. Until 1993 Operation Team Spirit in Korea remained the division's largest annual maneuver exercise, involving more than half of the division's strength.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Desert Storm and the Post-Cold War era ===\u000aNot many of the division's units participated in Operation Desert Storm, due to the division being earmarked for Pacific contingencies, such as a renewal of hostilities in Korea. However, during the Gulf War, one platoon each from Companies A, B and C, 4th Battalion, 27th Infantry (), deployed to Saudi Arabia in January 1991. These Tropic Lightning soldiers were scheduled to be replacement squads in the ground campaign; however, after observing their performance in desert warfare training, the Assistant Commander of Third U.S. Army asked for them to become the security force for the Army's forward headquarters. In that role, the Wolfhound platoons were alerted and attached to Third Army (Forward) into Kuwait City 26 February, where they secured the headquarters area and conducted mop-up operations in the city and its adjacent mine fields. Company A's platoon was separated from the other Wolfhounds following that battle to accompany General H. Norman Schwarzkopf into Iraq 1 March 1991 to provide security at the truce signing. The three platoons returned to Schofield Barracks without casualties on 20 March 1991.\u000aIn 1995, the division underwent another reorganization and reduction as a part of the Army's downsizing. First Brigade and its direct support units were inactivated and moved to Fort Lewis, Washington, where they were again reactivated as a detached brigade of the 25th Infantry Division (Light). In early 2005, an airborne brigade was created at Fort Richardson, Alaska and added to the 25th. Today the division is composed of the 1st and 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (based in Fort Wainwright, Alaska and Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, respectively), the 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Schofield Barracks) and The 4th Airborne Brigade Combat Team (based at Fort Richardson, Alaska), in addition to the Combat Aviation Brigade, a division support command and a complement of separate battalions. As a major ground reserve force for the U.S. Pacific Command, the "Tropic Lightning" Division routinely deploys from Schofield Barracks to participate in exercises in Japan, Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia and the Big Island of Hawaii.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ===\u000a\u000aThe division did not take part in the fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq from 2001\u20132003. However, in early 2004, units from the division deployed to Iraq to take part in the combat operations of that country. The 2d Brigade deployed in January 2004 to Iraq and returned to Schofield Barracks in February of the following year. The 3d Brigade, 25th Infantry Division began deploying to Afghanistan in March 2004. The first element to deploy was 2d Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment ("Wolfhounds"). They were accompanied by Battery B, 3d Battalion, 7th Field Artillery Regiment. The Wolfhounds operated in the volatile Paktika Province on the border with Pakistan in the Waziristan region. The 25th Infantry Division redeployed to Schofield Barracks Hawaii in April 2005.\u000a\u000aThe 25th Infantry Division is recognized for the first successful free democratic elections in Afghanistan on 9 October 2004. One of the missions of the 25th Infantry Division was to track down insurgent Taliban and Al-Qaeda members in the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan. In July 2005, a 4th Brigade was added to the 25th Infantry Division as an airborne brigade stationed in Fort Richardson, Alaska. It deployed in October 2006 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 2d Brigade began its transformation as a Stryker Brigade Combat Team while the 3d Brigade began its transformation as a unit of action (UA) in the same year. The (Light) status was dropped from the division name in January 2006. On 15 December 2006 the 172d Infantry Brigade was reflagged as the 1st BCT, 25th Infantry Division; concurrently, the former 1st BCT (Stryker) at Fort Lewis, Washington was reflagged as the 2d Cavalry Regiment (Stryker) and moved to Vilseck, Germany. From 2007 through 2009 elements of the 25th, including the 1/21 "Gimlets" from Schofield served in Iraq in the vicinity of Baghdad, serving proudly at great cost.\u000aAs of March 2009, the 1st BCT, 2d BCT, and 3d BCT were deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom while the 4th BCT deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\u000aIn June\u2013August 2009, elements of the 25th Division participated in Operation Champion Sword.\u000aDecember 2010 saw the division headquarters and Headquarters Battalion (HHBN) deploy to Baghdad Iraq to become the last Division Headquarters in Iraq. "Task Force Lightning" simultaneously advised and assisted Iraqi security forces, pursued insurgents, and prepared bases and equipment for transfer to Iraqi authorities. On 18 December 2011 the Division Headquarters completed its retrograde, training and security mission and redeployed back to Schofield Barracks Hawaii.\u000aIn April 2011, the 25th's 3d Brigade Combat Team assumed control of the most hostile area of Afghanistan, Regional Command East. A few months later the 1st Brigade deployed to RC-South. 4ABCT followed, deploying in late 2011 for a 12-month deployment. This is 4th Brigade's second deployment to Afghanistan.\u000aThe Combat Aviation Brigade, 25th Infantry Division was also in Afghanistan, from 1 January 2012 to 1 January 2013. The CAB operated in several key regions of Afghanistan, executing missions ranging from air assault to air movement, resupply and counterinsurgency operations. The CAB's Company F (Pathfinder), 2d Battalion, 25th Aviation Regiment, was on the ground conducting missions alongside Afghan forces. The Pathfinders conducted air assault missions with the 2nd Afghan National Civil Order Patrol SWAT to cut off the export of drugs into the area and keep the weapons from coming into the province. The CAB flew its last mission on 7 January 2013. The CAB, 3d Infantry Division took over 25th's mission.\u000aThe 3rd "Bronco" Brigade began their redeployment in January 2012, with the last main body arriving in Hawaii in April. During the deployment, Soldiers conducted counterinsurgency operations in some of the most deadly provinces in Afghanistan, to include Kunar province, home to the Pech River Valley. 4th ABCT returned October 2012 to JBER-Richardson, concluding their 10-month deployment.\u000aOn April 7 2017, military.com reported that U.S. Army announced the deployment of approximately 1,500 soldiers the 4th Brigade Combat Team to Afghanistan as part of Operation Freedom's Sentinel later in the year.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Organization ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Current structure ===\u000a\u000a25th Infantry Division\u000a1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team "Arctic Wolves" (under United States Army Alaska)\u000aHeadquarters & Headquarters Company\u000a5th Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment (RSTA)\u000a1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment\u000a3d Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment\u000a1st Battalion, 24th Infantry Regiment\u000a2d Battalion, 8th Field Artillery Regiment\u000a70th Brigade Engineer Battalion\u000a25th Support Battalion\u000a\u000a2d Infantry Brigade Combat Team "Warriors"\u000aHeadquarters & Headquarters Company\u000a2d Squadron, 14th Cavalry Regiment (RSTA)\u000a1st Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment\u000a1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment\u000a1st Battalion, 151st Infantry Regiment (IN NG)\u000a2d Battalion 11th Field Artillery Regiment\u000a65th Brigade Engineer Battalion\u000a225th Brigade Support Battalion\u000a\u000a3d Infantry Brigade Combat Team "Broncos"\u000aHeadquarters & Headquarters Company\u000a3d Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment "Raider"\u000a2d Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment "Wolfhounds"\u000a2d Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment "Cacti"\u000a100th Battalion, 442 Infantry Regiment, Army Reserve (Associate Unit)\u000a3d Battalion, 7th Field Artillery Regiment "Steel"\u000a29th Brigade Engineer Battalion\u000a325th Brigade Support Battalion "Mustangs"\u000a\u000a4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Airborne) "Spartan" (under United States Army Alaska)  Headquarters & Headquarters Company\u000a 1st Squadron, 40th Cavalry Regiment "Denali"\u000a 1st Battalion (Airborne), 501st Infantry Regiment "1 Geronimo"\u000a 3d Battalion (Airborne), 509th Infantry Regiment "3 Geronimo"\u000a 2d Battalion (Airborne), 377th Field Artillery Regiment "Spartan Steel"\u000a 6th Brigade Engineer Battalion \u201cOak\u201d\u000a 725th Brigade Support Battalion "Centurion"\u000a\u000a25th Infantry Division Artillery "Tropic Thunder" (The brigade's artillery battalions are under DIVARTY for training and readiness in garrison, but remain organic to their respective BCTs.)\u000aHeadquarters and Headquarters Battery, 25th Infantry Division Artillery\u000a\u000aCombat Aviation Brigade\u000aHeadquarters & Headquarters Company\u000a2d Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment (AH-64 Apache) "Lightning Horse"\u000a1st Battalion (Attack Reconnaissance), 25th Aviation Regiment (AH-64) "Gunfighters"\u000a2d Battalion, 25th Aviation Regiment (UH-60) "Diamond Head"\u000a3d Battalion, 25th Aviation Regiment (CH-47) "Hammerhead"\u000a209th Aviation Support Battalion "Lobos"\u000a\u000a25th Sustainment Brigade\u000aHeadquarters and Headquarters Company\u000aSpecial Troops Battalion\u000a524th Support Battalion\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Second World War ===\u000aSubordinate Units:\u000a27th Infantry Regiment\u000a35th Infantry Regiment\u000a298th Infantry Regiment\u000a161st Infantry Regiment\u000a34th Infantry Regiment\u000a25th Reconnaissance Troop\u000a\u000aDivision Support Command\u000a25th Signal Company\u000a725th Ordnance Company\u000a25th Quartermaster Company\u000a65th Engineer Battalion\u000a25th Medical Battalion\u000a25th Counter Intelligence Detachment\u000a\u000aDivision Artillery\u000a8th Field Artillery Battalion\u000a64th Field Artillery Battalion\u000a89th Field Artillery Battalion\u000a90th Field Artillery Battalion (155mm)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Past commanders ==\u000aSource:\u000a\u000a\u000a== Honors ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Campaigns ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Decorations ===\u000aMeritorious Unit Commendation (Army) for VIETNAM 1969\u000aMeritorious Unit Commendation (Army) for OIF 2007\u000aMeritorious Unit Commendation (Army)(1st Brigade) for OIF 2008-9 (This unit citation was not presented until 30 September 2013 by General Orders no. 2013-63.)\u000aMeritorious Unit Commendation (Army) (HHBN) for OND 2010-2011\u000aPhilippine Presidential Unit Citation for 17 OCTOBER 1944 TO 4 JULY 1945\u000aRepublic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation for:\u000aMASAN-CHINJU\u000aMUNSAN-NI\u000aRepublic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm for:\u000aVIETNAM 1966\u20131968\u000aVIETNAM 1968\u20131970\u000aRepublic of Vietnam Civil Action Honor Medal, First Class for VIETNAM 1966\u20131970\u000a\u000a\u000a== Division memorial ==\u000aThe 25th Infantry Division Memorial \u2013 at Schofield Barracks \u2013 consists of four statues.

aVGlossogobius ankaranensis is a species of fish in the Gobiidae family. This cavefish is endemic to the Ankarana Reserve in Madagascar. Its natural habitat is inland karsts.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cave system ==\u000aThe Ankarana Mountain Range, formed by middle Jurassic sedimentary rock, is located in northern Madagascar, and its highest mountain is about 300 m (980 ft) above sea level. Several trees grow in the mountains' canyons and downfallen caves. Evergreen trees especially have an advantage due to the waters from a system of rivers that flows through the underground caves. Two important rivers enter the mountain range, the Andranotsisiloha and the Besaboba. These rivers are perennial and provide essential nutrients and habitat for an immense amount of organisms such as G. ankaranensis. This species was found in the Second River Cave. The only approachable section of the Second Cave River is 150 m (490 ft) long and the deepest point is 2 m (6.6 ft) with a width of 5 m (16 ft). The water temperature benefits all organisms it houses because it oscillates around 21 °C (70 °F).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biology ==\u000aSeveral physical characteristics distinguish this species from others that live in the region. The lack of pigmentation causes this fish to look pink in color; its blood and internal organs are visible through the scales. Several rows of teeth are accommodated by a big mouth and thick lips. Another factor that helps accommodate the quantity of teeth is the fact that the lower jaws protrude further than the upper jaws. G. ankaranensis is not light sensitive because little to no sunlight reaches the waters in which this species lives. The lengths of these fish typically vary from about 4 to 7 cm (1.6\u20132.8 in), and they move around slowly with their mouths closed.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Nutrition ===\u000aFood is very abundant in these caves, which apparently keeps the population of these fishes stable. Some of the species that serve as food for G. ankaranensis are shrimps, insects, and wastes from other animals and the environment.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discovery ==\u000aThe discovery of G. ankaranensis was purely accidental. Two trips were performed by several scientists to the Ankarana Mountain Range. The first trip was in 1981 and its mission was to explore the wild life of the Ankarana mountains and rivers. During this trip, several new species of cave-adapted shrimps stood out to scientists and they decided to come back again. In 1986, much more attention was devoted to cave-adapted species. The new species G. ankaranensis, a white and blind fish, was found in the Second River Cave.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Eyes ==\u000aThese fish are blind; no ocular tissue is found in their eye sockets except for a little black spot in each of the eyes. An increase in predation when G. ankaranensis is exposed to UV light might be due to the lack of eyes and pigments. Pigments are necessary when G. ankaranensis is exposed to UV light because they deflect UV light.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Neuromasts ==\u000aNeuromasts (sensory papillae or pit organs) are interesting adaptations that this species of fish have developed to deal with reduced vision. These structures are not clustered in only one section of the individual\u2019s body but widely distributed. Six rows of neuromasts are located on the cheeks as well as the trunk of Glossogobius. Other rows of neuromasts can be found on the dorsolateral and ventrolateral series. G. ankaranensis dark-adapted lifestyle can be supported by the widespread presence of neuromasts along the species body.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Conservation status ==\u000aDespite its small range, G. ankaranensis is not considered threatened, as it lives entirely within the Ankarana Reserve in an isolated region that is not subjected to human changes (in part because of a local fady) and its population is relatively stable. Annual floods can be important because lots of food can be derived from them, but floods can drastically diminish the fish population living in these underground caves of the Ankarana Reserve. Though G. ankaranensis is generally dispersed among the caves of the Ankarana Mountain Range, the mountain range is very small (28 X 8 km at its widest region).\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aTyphleotris, another cave fish genus from Madagascar\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVHMS Decouverte was the French schooner Eclipse, launched in 1804, that was captured in 1806. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Decouverte. She served in the Caribbean, where she captured two privateers, one French and one American. She was sold in 1816.\u000a\u000a\u000a== French service ==\u000aEclipse was built as a schooner and launched in 1804. She was captured in 1807. The Royal Navy already had an Eclipse, and had just laid up a Decouverte, so the captured vessel became HMS Decouverte. She was registered on 3 January 1806.\u000a\u000a\u000a== British service ==\u000aBetween 1806 and 1807, Decouverte was under the command of Lieutenant the Honourable A. de Courcy. (It is not clear whether it was he who first commissioned her.)\u000aIn March 1807 Decouverte detained Trist, Rinker, master, as Trist was sailing from Bordeaux to New Orleans.\u000aIn February 1808 Decouverte was under the command of Lieutenant Colin Campbell. In that month she captured one French privateer and destroyed another, as well as the privateer's prize.\u000aOn 7 February Campbell was cruising between Altavella and the Main, when he discovered three vessels, two French schooner privateers and an English ship, their prize. One schooner escaped after a running battle. Decouverte succeeded in driving the other schooner and the ship on shore. Next morning, when Campbell sailed in to take possession of the two vessels, he found the enemy still in possession, covered by small arms fire from the shore. The British were able by cannon fire to drive the French from the ship. Campbell sent a request to the schooner under a flag of truce that she surrender the ship, together with whatever prisoners might be on board the schooner. The schooner's captain refused. Campbell then deployed a boarding party that set fire to the ship. The water was too shallow for the British to be able to get closer to the schooner, but Campbell was confident that she was wrecked on the rocks. The ship was Matilda, of Halifax, Nova Scotia, which had been sailing to Jamaica.\u000aIn the morning of 9 February, Cambell discovered an enemy schooner in Bottomless Cove. Decouverte gave chase and caught up with her by 3p.m. After a 45-minute exchange of fire, the enemy schooner struck. She turned out to be Dorade, from San Domingo. Dorade was armed with one long 18-pounder gun and two 9-pounder guns, and had a crew of 72 men under the command of Monsieur Netly. During the engagement three guns on Decouverte on the side in action were dismounted, which reduced her broadside. French casualties were heavy; the British had to bury at sea seven of Dorade's crew and Campbell estimated that they had lost and thrown overboard seven more during the fight. There were also three wounded. The British did not go unscathed; Decouverte had six men wounded, of whom one was mortally wounded and three were dangerously wounded.\u000aOn 21 January 1809 Decouverte arrived at Jamaica from Maraycabu.\u000aDecouverte came under the command in, in 1809, of Lieutenant Richard W. Graves.\u000aNext, in 1809-10 Decouverte was under the command of Lieutenant James Oliver until a severe eye injury forced Oliver to return to England. In 1812 there was a diplomatic correspondence about three seamen on Decouverte, all of whom claimed to be Americans, and one of whom claimed that Oliver had destroyed his protection (certificate of citizenship).\u000aIn April 1811 Lieutenant Richard Williams assumed command of Decouverte. Under his command she patrolled the Bahamas and the Gulfs of Mexico and Florida.\u000aIn June Decouverte brought into Nassau the slave ship Joanna. The number of slaves freed was 120. Decouverte also detained a schooner flying the Swedish flag, but carrying French property.\u000aOn her way to Jamaica Decouverte chased the French privateer Comet, of five guns and 80 men, for two hours. Williams had to give up the chase after a squall sent overboard Decouverte's fore-top-gallant mast and sprung her two lower masts, the fore mast badly. When Decouverte reached Port Royal she was ordered to undergo a thorough refit, something that would take nine months.\u000aWhile Decouverte underwent repairs the merchants of Jamaica lent the schooner Confiance to the Royal Navy. During this time Williams commanded Confiance.\u000aAfter Williams and Decouverte returned to sea, on 12 July 1812 she captured the American privateer Non-Pareil. Nonpareil, H. Martin, master, was armed with one gun and had a crew of 30 men. She was out of Savannah, Georgia, and had captured one schooner. Martin also had intended to attack the defenseless town of Harbour Island, Bahamas.\u000aBetween 28 July and 23 October 1812, British warships sent into Nassau 39 American and Spanish ships with American cargoes. Decouverte sent in Olympus (captured 29 July), sailing from Oporto to Havanah, and Augusta (captured 29 August), Haskell, master, sailing from Greenock to Charleston. These were carrying flour and logwood.\u000aDecouverte also drove two privateers from the coast, but was unable to capture them. While she was in Murray's anchorage, Bermuda, a heavy gale came up. Her crew was forced to cut away her masts to save her as she was only two cable-lengths (580 yards) from the shore.\u000aWhile escorting a convoy from New Providence on its way to Jamaica and Cape Haitian through the Caicos Passage, Decouverte prevented the American privateer brig Saratoga, of 16 guns and 140 men, from capturing a schooner. In 1814 Williams was transferred to the brig Edwards, a brigantine of 360 tons, 12 guns, and 74 men, possibly a transport, but his period of command was short-lived as an officer sent from England replaced him. Before Williams left the Jamaica station in 1815, he received a letter of thanks from the mayor and merchants of Kingston for his services to the trade.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Fate ==\u000aThe Navy sold Decouverte in 1816.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Citations and references ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Citations ===\u000a\u000a\u000a=== References ===\u000aAdderley, Rosanne Marion (2006) "New Negroes from Africa": Slave Trade Abolition and Free African Settlement in the Nineteenth-century Caribbean.

aVTin Huey is an American experimental rock and new wave band from Akron, Ohio, United States, that formed in the mid/late 1970s.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Original lineups ===\u000aThe band was originally known as Rags and started out with three members: Mark Price, Michael Aylward, and Stuart Austin. Later, the band decided to rename themselves after Aylward's younger brother. When the trio were Rags, Price (then known as Wesley the Stash) played guitar, Aylward played bass, and Austin (then known as Napoleon Lemens) played drums. Harvey Gold became the fourth member to join on organ.\u000aWhen Price left the band, the remaining members switched to acoustic music before hiring electric guitarist Arthur Baranoff and bassist Wayne Swickley.\u000aWhen they left, Price rejoined and became the bassist, while Aylward took on electric guitar, and Gold alternated between electric guitar and keyboards; they briefly added saxophonist Lochi MacIntosh to the lineup before replacing him with Ralph Carney. Chris Butler (who was the bassist for 15-60-75 (The Numbers Band), was the last to join, also on guitar. Tin Huey was part of the influx of bands emerging from the Akron/Cleveland music scene, others including Devo, Pere Ubu, Chi-Pig, the Electric Eels, the Bizarros and the Rubber City Rebels.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Career ===\u000aInspired by Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa, The Stooges and the Soft Machine, Tin Huey signed with Warner Bros. Records, recorded, and then released their debut album Contents Dislodged During Shipment in 1979 (later issued for the first time on CD by Collector's Choice Music in 2003). It wasn't a commercial success, however. Ralph Legnini (a.k.a. Ralph E.) played with the band for several early '80s shows before they went their separate ways. It would be two decades before they released any new material.\u000aTheir follow-up second album, Disinformation, was released in 1999 by Butler's Future Fossil Records. Since then, they have played shows both in Ohio and in the greater New York City area. Most recently, they assembled recordings from the mid-70s for their third album, Before Obscurity: The Bushflow Tapes. The album is a combination of studio recordings and live performances from JB's in Kent, Ohio, where they regularly played. They've also been gathering new material for their fourth album, New Stuff: Obscure Deluxe. Perversity was released on November 17, 2009, on the Smog Veil label, becoming their first new album in over a decade. New Stuff's exact release date is yet to be substantiated.\u000aIn 2003, Tin Huey were among the Midwestern/Akronite bands that were featured in the PBS documentary "It's Everything, And Then It's Gone, which covered the mostly overlooked stories about the bands who hailed from the Ohio music scene and developed the "Akron Sound".\u000aThat same year, Tin Huey played at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.\u000aTin Huey briefly became a septet after adding newcomer Bob Ethington, formerly of Unit 5. Price died after a four-year battle with colon cancer on November 6, 2008 at the age of 56. Following his death, Tin Huey as a band stopped performing. A spin-off band, Half Cleveland, was formed in 2007 featuring Gold, Butler, Ethington, and former Chi-Pig bassist Debbie Smith. They have played occasional shows in the Akron/Cleveland area, including opening a show at the Akron Civic Theater for Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders.\u000aSince Price's death, there have been a couple live 'events', one a jam loosely dedicated to Mark involving all the surviving members of the Hueys, bass handled by Gold, Smith, and Kristoffer Carter (The KC Show). The second was an Arts Program benefit billed as "A Gaggle of Hueys and a Houseguest" featuring original Hueys Gold, Aylward and Austin, along with Dave Rich of Houseguest. Recently, Gold and Aylward have also been playing improvisational guitar duets at local art galleries.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Current line-up of Tin Huey ==\u000aMichael Aylward (Guitar, Vocals)\u000aStuart Austin (Drums, Percussion)\u000aChris Butler (Guitar, Vocals)\u000aHarvey Gold (Keyboards, Bass, Guitar, Vocals)\u000a"Bongo" Bob Ethington (???)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Former members of the Rags/Tin Huey ==\u000aArthur Baranoff (Electric Guitar)\u000aWayne Swickley (Bass)\u000aLochi MacIntosh (Horns)\u000aRalph Legnini (Guitar)\u000aMark Price (Bass, Vocals) (deceased)\u000aRalph Carney (Horns) (deceased)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discography ==\u000aTin Huey (EP) (1977) (Clone Records)\u000aBreakfast With The Hueys (EP) (1978) (Clone Records)\u000aContents Dislodged During Shipment (1979) (Warner Bros.

aVSnow White and the Three Stooges is the second feature film to star the Three Stooges after their 1959 resurgence in popularity. By this time, the trio consisted of Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Joe DeRita (dubbed "Curly Joe"). Released by 20th Century Fox, this was the trio's take on the classic fairy tale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The film was retitled Snow White and the Three Clowns in Great Britain.\u000aOlympic gold medalist figure skater Carol Heiss starred as Snow White, who must flee her home after The Evil Queen, her evil stepmother, wishes her to be dead. Seeking refuge in the cottage of the seven dwarfs, she accidentally meets the Stooges, who are house sitting for them while they are away.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000aOnce upon a time, in the kingdom of Fortunia, a noble king and his lovely young queen lack but one blessing to make their joy complete. The queen gives birth to a daughter named Snow White, but dies soon after. The king mourns her, but in time, he remarries because of the pleading of his people. His new Queen is a beautiful, but evil woman who soon becomes jealous of Snow White's beauty.\u000aOn her 17th birthday, Snow White's father dies and the wicked queen immediately imprisons her. Eventually, the queen's jealousy of her stepdaughter becomes so great that she orders her killed. Snow White escapes her hired assassin and finds refuge in the empty cottage of the seven dwarfs, soon to be joined by the Three Stooges, who are traveling to the castle with their ward Quatro. But the boy they have raised since childhood (also narrowly escaping an assassination attempt by the queen) is in reality Prince Charming, who though he has lost his memory, is betrothed to Snow White.\u000aSnow White and the Prince fall in love, but the queen has him kidnapped when she suspects his true identity. The Stooges, disguised as cooks, attempt to rescue him, but he falls from a staircase in the palace and is presumed dead. Meanwhile, the queen learns from her magic mirror that Snow White is still alive. With the help of her magician, Count Oga, she transforms herself into a witch and succeeds in getting Snow White to take a bite from a poisoned apple.\u000aAs she rides back to the palace, she encounters the Stooges, and thanks to an inadvertent wish they make on a magic sword (stolen from Count Oga), she crashes her broom into a mountainside and falls to her death. The Stooges then find the poisoned Snow White, but they do not bury her. Instead, they place her on a bed, and pray to her each day.\u000aMeanwhile, the Prince (Quatro) has not died from his fall. Instead, he is saved by a group of men who want to revolt against the Evil Queen's rule over Fortunia. As the prince recovers, he realizes that his memory has returned, and so he knows that he is indeed a Prince, and that Snow White is the princess he was destined to marry.\u000aAfter leading a successful revolt which places him on the throne of Fortunia, the prince sends out searchers to find Snow White and the Stooges, unaware that, thanks to yet another inadvertent wish on Count Oga's sword, they are no longer in the country of Fortunia. All searches are fruitless, and Prince Charming is close to giving up hope when he learns of the Evil Queen's magic mirror. The mirror responds truthfully to the desperate Prince's pleas, and the Prince sets off on his journey. He arrives at the Stooges' cabin just in time to dispel the effects of the poisoned apple. Snow White and Prince Charming are married and live happily ever after.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Primary cast ==\u000a\u000aMoe Howard: Moe\u000aLarry Fine: Larry\u000aJoe DeRita: Curly Joe\u000aCarol Heiss: Snow White\u000aEdson Stroll: Quatro/Prince Charming\u000aPatricia Medina: The Evil Queen/Witch, Snow White's evil stepmother\u000aGuy Rolfe: Count Oga\u000aMichael David: Rolf\u000aBuddy Baer: Hordred\u000aEdgar Barrier: King Augustus\u000aPeter Coe: Captain\u000aMark Bailey: Captain of the Guard\u000aMel Blanc: voice of Quinto\u000aHerbie Faye: Head Cook\u000aBlossom Rock: Servant\u000aPaul Frees: Narrator/The Magic Talking Mirror (voice)\u000aOwen McGiveney: Physician\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production ==\u000aFrank Tashlin was originally set to direct the film at a budget of $750,000 ($6,141,982 today). Fox then replaced him with Walter Lang, who had previously directed the Stooges in 1933's Meet the Baron. Lang transformed the film into a lavish epic with a budget of $3.5 million ($28,662,584 today), making it the most expensive film the Stooges ever starred in. The film was produced and co-written by future U.S. Information Agency head Charles Z. Wick.\u000aCarol Heiss' uncredited singing voice was dubbed by Norma Zimmer (of Lawrence Welk fame).\u000aEdson Stroll's singing voice was dubbed by Bill Lee.\u000aPatricia Medina later recalled that Carol Heiss repeatedly tried to get her fired from the film.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reception ==\u000aDespite the significant investment, Snow White and the Three Stooges did poorly at the box office. The only 1960s Stooge feature filmed in color, it also became the least popular. Critics did not take kindly to the film, citing a lack of on-screen time for the trio. The studio was unable to recover the film's costs because the comedy-fantasy was tailored specifically to children who paid only fifty cents each for admission. It would have taken an audience of over 15 million minors for Snow White and the Three Stooges to merely break even. Moe Howard himself often referred to the film as "a Technicolor mistake."\u000aThe film, however, was nominated for the Writers Guild of America award for Best Musical Screenplay for 1961.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of American films of 1961\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aSnow White and the Three Stooges on IMDb\u000aSnow White and the Three Stooges at the TCM Movie Database\u000aSnow White and the Three Stooges at AllMovie\u000aSnow White and the Three Stooges at threestooges.net

aVLawrence Lavon Linville (September 29, 1939 \u2013 April 10, 2000) was an American actor. He was best known for his portrayal of the surgeon Major Frank Burns on the television series M*A*S*H.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life and education ==\u000aLinville was born in Ojai, California, the son of Fay Pauline (née Kennedy) and Harry Lavon Linville. Raised in Sacramento, he attended El Camino High School (Class of 1957) and later studied aeronautical engineering at the University of Colorado at Boulder before applying for a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aAfter returning to the United States, Linville began his acting career at the Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, a year-round repertory theatre under director Robert Porterfield.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Before M*A*S*H ===\u000aBefore his five-year co-starring role on M*A*S*H, Linville had guest-starring roles on many of the well-known television series of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Included in his credits in that period are one appearance each on Bonanza, Room 222 and Adam-12. He had three appearances, as three different characters, on Mission: Impossible over three seasons of that television series. On the early seasons of Mannix, Linville had a recurring role as Lieutenant George Kramer, an ally of Mannix in the L.A. Police Department.\u000aLinville played a doctor on the television movie The Night Stalker (1972), a predecessor of the Kolchak television series, and in the episode titled "Chopper" of Kolchak: The Night Stalker, he played the youngest police captain on the force investigating murders committed by a headless motorbike rider. He also had a small role in the film Kotch (1971), which was directed by Jack Lemmon and starred Walter Matthau. Linville also appeared as U.S. Treasury Agent Hugh Emery in the 1972 television series SEARCH episode "One of Our Probes is Missing".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== M*A*S*H ===\u000a\u000aWhen the television series M*A*S*H started, Linville signed a five-year contract. He played Frank Burns, a major and surgeon. He achieved wide recognition in this role, in which his character was contrasted with those played by Alan Alda and others in the ensemble. During that period, the sitcom's tone had changed from pure comedy to more drama-focused story lines, as it reflected issues related to the Vietnam War (though M*A*S*H was set during the Korean War, it aired during the Vietnam and post-Vietnam era and tended to reflect this period in a roundabout fashion). He was offered a renewal for two more seasons when his contract expired, but he declined. After five seasons, Linville had grown tired of playing the character. Linville felt that he had taken the Frank Burns character as far as he could, and chose to leave the series to pursue other roles.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== After M*A*S*H ===\u000aAfter M*A*S*H, Linville starred or appeared in many films and television series. He was a guest-star on many television series, most frequently Murder, She Wrote; Fantasy Island; The Love Boat; The FBI Story; and CHiPs. He also appeared on episodes of Airwolf (he played Maxwell in "And a Child Shall Lead") and The Rockford Files, and appeared in the television movie The Girl, the Gold Watch & Dynamite (1981). He also played a stock character\u2014the "Crazy General"\u2014along with Edward Winter in the pilot episode of Misfits of Science. He also co-starred in the short-lived sitcom Grandpa Goes to Washington with Jack Albertson.\u000aLinville appeared as jealous ex-boyfriend Randy Bigelow in the 1982 short-lived Disney series Herbie, the Love Bug. He also starred in the short-lived The Jeffersons spinoff Checking In, where he played Florence Johnston's (Marla Gibbs) nemesis, Lyle Block; however, this series only lasted four episodes. Linville co-starred in 1984 on Paper Dolls, a nighttime drama on ABC offering a glimpse behind-the-scenes of the fashion industry. In 1991, Linville appeared on an episode of the television series Night Court as a doctor. Linville also appeared in an episode of ER in 1994 as a medical consultant. He also appeared in an episode of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman season 1 episode 3 as a crackpot claiming to have been abducted by Superman and taken aboard his spaceship.\u000aHe also had roles in many films, including School Spirit (1985), Earth Girls Are Easy (1988), C.H.U.D. II: Bud the C.H.U.D. (1989), Rock 'n' Roll High School Forever (1991), A Million to Juan (1994) and No Dessert, Dad, till You Mow the Lawn (1994).\u000aLinville appeared as an interview subject for Memories of M*A*S*H, a 1991 special commemorating the 20th anniversary of the series. In 1997, he joined Larry Gelbart (the producer and creator of M*A*S*H) and David Ogden Stiers (who played Frank Burns' replacement on the sitcom, Major Charles Winchester) to attend a deactivation ceremony for the last remaining U.S. MASH unit in Korea.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Marriage and family ==\u000aHe was married five times: to Kate Geer (sister of actress Ellen Geer), with whom he had a daughter, Kelly Linville (born 1970) before they divorced. Kelly was his only child. He also married (and divorced) Vana Tribbey, Melissa Gallant, and Susan Hagan. His last marriage was to Deborah Guydon, who was by his side when he died.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Surgery, illness, and death ==\u000aAfter doctors found a malignant tumor under his sternum, Linville underwent surgery in February 1998 to remove part of his lung. He received further treatment, but had continuing health problems over the next two years. Linville died of pneumonia in New York City on April 10, 2000, after complications from cancer surgery. His ashes were scattered at sea off the coast of Bodega Bay, California.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Partial filmography ==\u000aKotch (1971) - Peter Stiel\u000aBunny O'Hare (1971) - Max (Collector #1)\u000aThe Stepmother (1972) - Dick Hill\u000aM*A*S*H (1972-1977, TV Series) - Major Frank Burns\u000aSchool Spirit (1985) - President Grimshaw\u000aEarth Girls Are Easy (1988) - Dr. Bob\u000aCHUD II: Bud the CHUD (1989) - Dr. Jewell\u000aRock 'n' Roll High School Forever (1991) - Principal McGree\u000aBody Waves (1992) - Himmel\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aLarry Linville on IMDb\u000aLarry Linville at the TCM Movie Database\u000aLarry Linville at AllMovie\u000a'M*A*S*H' actor Linville dead at 60 at CNN.com\u000aLarry Linville at Find a Grave\u000awww.larrylinville.com

aVKyron Horman (September 9, 2002 \u2013 disappeared June 4, 2010) is an American boy who went missing after not returning home from Skyline Elementary School in Portland, Oregon, on June 4, 2010. Local and state police along with the FBI conducted an exhaustive search for the boy and launched a criminal investigation, but have not uncovered any significant information regarding the boy's whereabouts.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aKyron Horman was born on September 9, 2002, in Portland, Oregon. He attended Skyline Elementary School near Forest Park.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Disappearance ==\u000aOn June 4, 2010, Kyron was brought to school by his stepmother, Terri Horman (née Moulton), who then stayed with him while he attended a science fair. Terri Horman stated that she left the school at around 8:45 a.m. and remembered seeing Kyron walking down the hall to his first class. However, he was never seen in his first math class; instead, he was marked absent for the day and has not been seen since.\u000a\u000aHorman's statements to the police indicate that, after leaving the school at 8:45 a.m., she ran errands at a local grocery store until about 10:10 a.m. Between 10:10 a.m. and 11:39 a.m., she states that she drove her daughter around town in an attempt to use the motion of the vehicle to soothe the toddler's earache. Horman went to a local gym at 11:39 a.m., and worked out until about 12:40 p.m. By 1:21 p.m., she had arrived home and posted photos on Facebook of Kyron at the science fair earlier that morning.\u000aAt 3:30 p.m., Horman, her husband Kaine Horman, and their daughter, Kiara, walked to the school bus stop to meet Kyron. The bus driver informed them that Kyron had not boarded the bus after school. The bus driver was asked to call the school and ask where Kyron was. She was informed by the school secretary that Kyron hadn't been in school since early that day and had been marked absent. She reported to the secretary that she did not have Kyron and, therefore, he was missing. The secretary then called the 911 call center using a private phone number assigned to the Portland Public School district to report that Kyron was missing. The 911 call center then reported this information to the police. Ultimately, there was no indictment of Terri Moulton Horman after the Multnomah County Grand Jury heard the case in 2010.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Divorce and restraining order ==\u000aIn late June 2010, in the midst of the investigation into Kyron's disappearance, Kyron's biological father, Kaine Horman, was reportedly told by investigators that his wife, Terri Horman, had offered their landscaper "a lot of money" to kill him. Rodolfo Sanchez, the landscaper, said in a deposition that she approached him to help kill her husband five months before the disappearance of the boy, in January 2010. Investigators convinced the landscaper to confront Horman while wearing a wire, but they were unable to obtain any evidence and, therefore, did not make an arrest. On June 28, Kaine Horman filed for divorce and obtained a restraining order against his wife. The divorce was granted and Terri Horman was eventually granted supervised visitation with her daughter.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Lawsuit ==\u000a\u000aOn June 1, 2012, Kyron's mother (Desiree Young) filed a lawsuit against Terri Horman claiming that she is "responsible for the disappearance of Kyron." The civil lawsuit would attempt to prove that Horman had kidnapped Kyron. Young was seeking $10,000,000 in damages from Horman. On August 15, 2012, a federal court judge denied the motion by Terri Horman to delay the lawsuit.\u000aOn July 30, 2013, it was announced that Desiree Young had dropped the lawsuit against Terri Horman:\u000a\u000aWith "great disappointment," the mother of Kyron Horman said Tuesday she is dropping a civil suit against Terri Horman because she doesn't want it to jeopardize the police investigation. "Because my civil case can't go forward without the police criminal investigation file, it's with great disappointment I make this difficult decision," Desiree Young told reporters. Young was tearful as she spoke at the press conference outside the Multnomah County Courthouse in downtown Portland. She said in order for her lawyers to move forward with the suit, they need the police file \u2014 which they can't have during an active police investigation."\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of people who disappeared mysteriously\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a\u000aKyron Horman at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children\u000aKyron Horman: Timeline of events since boy's disappearance\u000aKyron Horman news articles by Oregonlive/The Oregonian\u000aDr. Phil Show "Where Is Missing Kyron Horman?

aVThe Chicago Yacht Club is located in Chicago, Illinois. The Chicago Yacht Club is best known for organizing the Chicago Yacht Club Race to Mackinac each July. It also hosts dozens of other races and regattas throughout the boating season. It has two club houses, one at Monroe Harbor and one at Belmont Harbor.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe Chicago Yacht Club was founded in 1875 to encourage and promote the sport of yachting. In 1898, the first Race to Mackinac was held. In 1900, the club obtained its first clubhouse, the Argo clubhouse located at the Illinois Central Pier #3.\u000aChicago Yacht Club's original Chicago to Mackinac Trophy dates to 1906. The trophy has been awarded annually since 1921. Although the Chicago to Mackinac races were skipped in 1917-1920 due to World War I, they were sailed every year of World War II. In 1920, the Lincoln Park Yacht Club, which had helped start the Canada's Cup, combined with the Chicago Club.\u000aIn 1955, construction began of the current Monroe Harbor Station, one of two clubhouses maintained by the club. The other clubhouse (41.9406°N 87.6352°W\ufeff / 41.9406; -87.6352\ufeff (Chicago Yacht Club, Belmont Harbor Station)) is located in Belmont Harbor and is host to the club's One Design sailing fleet.\u000aAmong those who have sailed for the club is Robert Halperin, Richard Stearns and William Parks who won an Olympic bronze medal in 1960. Halperin also won a Pan American Games gold medal in 1963 in yachting, and was also a football player at Notre Dame, Wisconsin, and in the NFL, one of Chicago's most-decorated World War II heroes, and Chairman of Commercial Light Co.\u000aAs part of the Club's centennial celebrations in 1975, Richard and Wendy Van Mell edited 'The First hundred years : a history of the Chicago Yacht Club, 1875-1975' \u000aThe Club competed for the America's Cup in the 1987 Louis Vuitton Cup, represented by the Heart of America boat, skippered by Buddy Melges. The Club's entry finished 8th of 13 boats in the competition to determine the cup competitor. The presentation of a challenge from a Lake Michigan yacht club, required adjudication of whether the lake was an "arm of the sea", as required by the Deed of Gift of the America's Cup and the decision allowed Great Lakes boats to compete.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Activities ==\u000aChicago Yacht Club hosts a series of on the water events throughout the boating season.\u000aIn June, the club hosts the SAILING WORLD Magazine's National Offshore One Design (NOOD) Regatta which draws a several hundred competitors from around North America.\u000aEach July, the club hosts the Chicago Yacht Club Race to Mackinac, one of the longest running fresh-water sailing races in the world. The race starts from just off the Chicago Harbor Lighthouse, continues up the length of Lake Michigan and finishes on Mackinac Island off the round island lighthouse.\u000aAnother signature event is the annual VERVE Cup regatta held each August. The "Verve" hosts both an inshore event and an offshore event and attracts the top sailors in the country.\u000aChicago Yacht Club is a leader in teaching children and adults to sail, teaching sailing lessons for over 84 years.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Commodore ==\u000aLeif Sigmond (2017-2018)\u000aGregory Miarecki (2015-2016)\u000aGerald Bober (2013-2014)\u000aJoseph Haas (2011-2012)\u000aSheldon Clark\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVWhiteman's Green is a place in the north of the large village and civil parish of Cuckfield in the Mid Sussex District of West Sussex, England. It is located on the southern slopes of the Weald, two miles (3.2 km) west of Haywards Heath and surrounded on other sides by Cuckfield Rural civil parish. The area was designated a conservation area in 1989. There are five listed buildings, the earliest of which dates back to the 15th century. At the 2011 Census the population of the place was included in the town of Burgess Hill.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aIn 1822 Gideon Mantell discovered the fossilised remains of the first dinosaur to be found in England in a quarry at Whiteman's Green. In 1944 one of the three V-1 flying bomb to land on England the first night they were used fell at Mizbrooks Farm just to the west.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Facilities ==\u000aThere is a petrol station which serves Cuckfield, and traffic heading to the A23 road. Cuckfield Golf Course is located to the west of Whiteman's Green, along with Cuckfield's largest pet store. The Ship Inn was closed in 2014 and is now a CO-OP, and a second hand car dealership.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Recreation ==\u000aWhiteman's Green has a large recreation ground, home to the local football team, Cuckfield Cosmos, and neighbouring town Haywards Heath's Rugby Team. The ground is also regularly used by kitesurfers due to the strong winds often present. A recent addition to this area is the Skate Park. Parking is limited, and at busy times, namely Saturday mornings, cars park along the main road. Calls for parking restrictions or car park expansion have been made by local residents of Mill Hall. A skate park is now in place on the green itself. The Ship Inn was a notable public house situated in Whiteman's Green, and is the location of the Brook Street Rowing Club's annual dinner. However the Ship INN was closed in 2014 and is now a CO-OP Supermarket\u000a\u000a\u000a== Mill Hall ==\u000aMill Hall was a school for the deaf, first opened just after the second world war. The first headmistress was Mrs Crosby. It closed in the 1990s with the opening of Court Meadow school in Cuckfield. It has since been developed into housing, and until recently was home to Mill Hall School Day Nursery - which closed in 2008.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Berlin Marathon (branded BMW Berlin Marathon for sponsorship reasons) is a major running and sporting event held annually in Berlin, Germany. The official marathon distance of 42.195 kilometers (26 miles 385 yards) is set up as a citywide road race where professional athletes and amateur runners jointly participate. Initiated in 1974, the event traditionally takes place on the last weekend in September.\u000aThe Berlin marathon is one of the largest and most popular road races in the world. In 2016, the race had 46,950 entrants (41,283 runners, 5,445 inline skaters, 185 hand bikers, 37 wheel-chairers) from 122 countries, and more than one million spectators. Along with five other races, it forms the World Marathon Majors, a series offering a $1 million prize purse to be split equally between the top male and female marathoners.\u000aThe most marathon world records for men and women have been set at the Berlin course, which is known for its flat profile, even surface, cheering spectators, and frequently mild autumn temperatures. For a record six consecutive years (2011\u20132016), Berlin has been the site of the world leading men's time for the year (Boston 2011 with strong tailwind excluded).\u000aThe event is split over two days. About 8,000 additional inline skaters compete at the marathon course the Saturday before the running event. Power walkers, handbikers, wheelchair riders, and a children's marathon (4.2195 km) are also part of the marathon weekend, which is organised by SCC EVENTS and sponsored by BMW.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Course ==\u000a\u000aThe course within the metropolis starts and finishes near the Brandenburg Gate. Because of the division of city, the marathon events before 1990 were limited to the area of West Berlin. Only on 30 September 1990, were athletes able to run through the Brandenburg Gate and the unified city saw its first race running through both halves. It was reported that a great many of the runners had tears in their eyes as they ran through the gate.\u000aNowadays, after leaving Brandenburg Gate, the course passes Charlottenburg, around Tiergarten, along Moabit and Mitte, and then south to Friedrichshain. After that, it winds west between Kreuzberg and Neukölln, through Schöneberg, over to Friedenau and Zehlendorf, before turning north back toward the city's center. Looping above Schöneberg, the course comes full circle as it finishes through the Gate.\u000aThis route differs from the one used at the 1936 Summer Olympics Marathon.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Results ==\u000a\u000aWorld records\u000aMen\u000aWomen\u000aKey:   Current course record   German championship race\u000a\u000a\u000a== Finishers ==\u000aIn terms of finishing athletes the 2008 Berlin marathon was the 5th largest marathon run of all time. 35,913 athletes including 130 power walkers (not including handbiker or wheelchair competitors) reached the finish in under 6 hours.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Skater-Marathon ==\u000aThe 2008 skater marathon had numbered 7,685 participants and counted around 200,000 spectators along the course.

The area of modern Wrzeszcz used to be forest and fields of heather.\u000aHistorical sources mention Vriezst in 1263 AD and Vriest 1283 as a place of a mill and by the end of the 13th century the Cistercian Monks of Oliwa owned four or five water mills on the Strieß (Strzy\u017ca), the creek running through Wrzeszcz. Vriest is Low German as well as Dutch language word meaning frost.\u000aIn 1412 AD, this suburban village was granted to Danzig city councillor Gerd von der Beke, an ally of the Teutonic Knights. The place was known as Langfuhr in the German language.\u000aEarly area landowners included the Bischof family, who held the increasingly residential settlement in the late-16th century and early-17th century, and the Köhne family, which started acquiring possessions in the Langfuhr area in 1616 AD. Danzig patrician Zacharias Zappio acquired most of the land between today's Slowackiego and Do Studzienki streets and built a palace there. When King John III Sobieski visited the palace in 1677 AD, the little valley where the palace was located was renamed Königstal (Dolina Krolewska), or King's Valley, to commemorate the occasion. Strictly speaking, in the 17th century the name Langfuhr referred only to a small market square, 130 m by 35 m, on what today is known as Aleja Grunwaldzka (pl) (i.e. Grunwald Avenue).\u000a\u000aBetween 1767 and 1770, Danzig mayor Daniel Gralath made a personal project of turning the two kilometers of old road between Langfuhr and Danzig proper into the four-lane, tree-lined Grand Avenue, as it was then renamed. Each lane of the avenue was lined by 350 trees imported from the Netherlands, and the entire cost of the project was the immense sum (for the time) of 100,000 guilders.\u000aIn the 18th century, residential construction aimed at the wealthy city folk took precedence. The erected residences were mostly classical style with beautiful gardens and the obligatory tree-lined driveways. By 1804, Langfuhr had about 900 residents, most of them working in breweries, distilleries, retailers, and factories making a kind of ash used to bleach cloth.\u000aOn 6 December 1807, under French occupation, the Danzig-Prussian convention made the town part of the Napoleonic Free City of Danzig. After the Congress of Vienna of 1814\u20131815, Danzig was reincorporated into Prussia.\u000aFrom the mid-19th century onwards, Langfuhr grew to become a fashionable and wealthy borough with beautifully decorated city villas for wealthier residents and even spacious accommodation for local labourers. In 1872, Langfuhr was joined to Danzig by a horse-drawn tram along the Grand Avenue.\u000a\u000aIn 1904, the Königliche Technische Hochschule zu Danzig Grand Hall was built, soon followed by the city hospital, which is now the medical academy. Until 1919 Langfuhr was the garrison of the 1st Life Hussar Regiment (since 1901 Brigade) with large barracks built in the 1890s. In 1910 the first airfield of Danzig was established on the hussar's parade ground. After World War I Erhard Milch's "Danziger Luftpost GmbH" (Danzig Airmail) and the "Lloyd Ostflug" were located at Langfuhr.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Effects of World War II ==\u000aAfter World War II the town became part of Poland according to the Potsdam Conference and renamed to the Polish Wrzeszcz. Its German inhabitants either fled before the advancing Red Army or were expelled. The renaming was based on medieval records but caused the protests of the arriving Polish settlers as it was regarded unpronounceable and has a similarity to the Polish term "wrzeszczec" (bellow).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Present ==\u000a\u000aThe airport was replaced by the Gda\u0144sk Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa Airport in 1974 and large housing complexes have been built on the former airport area.\u000aThe borough is now developing rapidly. A great deal of commercial activity (particularly banking and shopping) now takes place in Wrzeszcz. A number of international firms such as Citibank, ING Bank, Fortis Bank, and Shell have chosen to locate their offices there rather than in the Gda\u0144sk city center, large shopping centers such as Galeria Ba\u0142tycka and Centrum Handlowe Manhattan are opening along Grunwaldzka Street, and extensive military properties have been sold to housing developers.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notable residents ==\u000aGünter Grass (1927\u20132015), author\u000aBronis\u0142aw Komorowski (1889\u20131940), priest\u000aHermann Balck (1893\u20131982), general\u000aEddi Arent (1925\u20132013), actor\u000aWolfgang Völz (born 1930), actor\u000aUlrich Kessler (1894\u20131983), Luftwaffe general\u000aJoachim von Tresckow (1894\u20131958), Wehrmacht general\u000aAlfred Dannebaum (1918\u20131999), German officer\u000aSiegfried Freytag (1919\u20132003), Luftwaffe pilot\u000aLeopold Koss (1920-2012), cytopathologist\u000a\u000a\u000a== Points of interest ==\u000aGda\u0144sk University of Technology (Politechnika Gda\u0144ska)\u000aGda\u0144sk Medical University\u000aBaltic Opera\u000aManhattan Shopping Centre\u000aGaleria Ba\u0142tycka Shopping Centre\u000aGda\u0144sk Wrzeszcz railway station\u000aForest Theatre (Teatr Le\u015bny)\u000aJohannes Gutenberg monument, founded 22 June 1890 at Gutenberghain [1]\u000aNew Synagogue\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aWrzeszcz district\u000aTechnical University of Gdansk\u000aMedical University of Gda\u0144sk\u000aTricity\u000aOld pictures of Langfuhr\u000aCentrum Handlowe Manhattan\u000aGaleria Ba\u0142tycka

aVKenneth Donald "Ken" Macintosh (born 15 January 1962) is the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament and an MSP for the West Scotland region. He was first elected in the 1999 Scottish Parliament election as a Scottish Labour Co-operative Party candidate, and retained his seat of Eastwood in the 2003, 2007 and the 2011 elections, but lost it in the 2016 election. In that election, he was returned on the regional list.\u000aHe was previously employed as a television producer for the BBC, working on its news broadcasts and election coverage between 1987 and 1999.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aBorn in Inverness, Macintosh was educated at the Portree and Oban primary schools before attending Royal High School, Edinburgh. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh with an History MA (Hons) in 1984.\u000aBoth his parents were headteachers. His father Dr Farquhar Macintosh CBE was a Gaelic speaker from Skye, a leading intellectual in Scottish education and was Rector of the Royal High in Edinburgh and chair of the Scottish Examination Board. His mother, Margaret Macintosh, is from Peebles and was head of Drummond Community High and assistant head of Wester Hailes Education Centre.\u000a\u000a\u000a== BBC career ==\u000aBefore Macintosh became an MSP, he was from 1987 to 1999, a television producer for the BBC News Network. He also worked on Breakfast with Frost, Breakfast News, and the Nine O'Clock News. He was also worked as a researcher on election programmes for both David Dimbleby and Jonathan Dimbleby.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Member of the Scottish Parliament ==\u000aAt the 1999 election, he won the Eastwood constituency with a majority of 2,125.\u000aIn February 2002, Macintosh was appointed as a ministerial parliamentary aide (MPA) to Minister for Education and Young People, Cathy Jamieson. He resigned from this role in September 2002 when he voted against the Labour-Liberal Democrat Coalition Scottish Executive over the closure of the A&E department at the Glasgow Victoria Infirmary.\u000aIn 2005 Macintosh had to resign from his position as Deputy Convenor on the Standards Committee after it was revealed he had failed to declare £330 of hospitality from McDonald's within the required time.\u000aIn 2006 and 2007 Macintosh has proposed a Member's Bill to the Scottish Parliament providing for the tougher regulation of sunbed parlours, which passed successfully. Since his election in 1999 has been a member of the cross-party group on cancer. From February 2007 to April 2007, he was a Ministerial Parliamentary Aide to the First Minister Jack McConnell.\u000aMacintosh was re-elected as MSP for Eastwood at the 2007 election with a narrow majority of 913, where he fought off a strong challenge from the Conservative Party's Jackson Carlaw. Macintosh was appointed Shadow Minister for Schools and Skills.\u000aMacintosh considered running for the 2008 Scottish Labour leadership election but pulled out and instead backed Andy Kerr's candidacy.\u000aAt the 2011 parliamentary election he once again defeated Jackson Carlaw with an increased majority of 2,012. The swing was 8.7% from Conservative to Labour. Macintosh had feared losing the constituency following boundary changes (with the removal of Barrhead, Neilston and Uplawmoor) which gave a notional Conservative majority of almost 3500. After the party's loss to the SNP, Macintosh was made Shadow Culture and External Affairs Secretary. Only a week later though, he took over the Shadow Education portfolio after MSP Malcolm Chisholm resigned over an internal party disagreement.\u000a\u000a\u000a== 2011 Scottish Labour Party leadership election ==\u000aKen Macintosh launched his candidacy for leader of the Scottish Labour Party on 12 September 2011. MSP colleagues who endorsed his leadership bid included: his campaign manager Michael McMahon, Claire Baker, Mary Fee, Neil Bibby, Mark Griffin, Kezia Dugdale and Jenny Marra. Macintosh was also supported by East Renfrewshire MP Jim Murphy, co-author of the Review of the Labour Party in Scotland. Murphy and Macintosh share the same constituency office in Clarkston, East Renfrewshire.\u000aIn an address to party members, Macintosh said he was a devolutionist, not a unionist.\u000aOn 28 October 2011, Macintosh officially launched his leadership campaign at Cumbernauld College in North Lanarkshire. He described the 2011 Holyrood election result as a "disaster", and that the party had been too negative and if it did not change it "will consign ourselves to steady decline and years of opposition. We need to unite as a party and to start talking positively about our values, what Labour stands for and not just what we are against."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Miliband gaffe ===\u000aDespite lacking ministerial experience "having never put a feather on the front bench" he was widely seen as a frontrunner in the leadership contest; however, UK Labour leader Ed Miliband was unable to recall Ken Macintosh's name during a TV interview with BBC Scotland, during the September 2011 Labour Party Conference. After the interview, Miliband telephoned Macintosh to apologise for his mistake. Later, Macintosh tried to downplay the incident saying "I don't think anyone should read anything into it \u2013 half the time I can't even remember the names of my own kids."\u000a\u000a\u000a== 2015 Scottish Labour Party leadership election ==\u000aFollowing Scottish Labour's near wipeout at the 2015 General Election, Ken Macintosh decided to stand in the 2015 Scottish Labour Party leadership election, triggered by the resignation of Jim Murphy. Macintosh faced a straight two-way contest with previous deputy leader Kezia Dugdale, who won the leadership.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament ==\u000aOn 12 May 2016, Ken Macintosh was elected presiding officer with 71 votes on the third round of voting. He beat Murdo Fraser, Johann Lamont, John Scott and Elaine Smith. He suspended his Labour membership upon taking office, per the tradition that the Presiding Officer is strictly nonpartisan.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aHe and his wife Claire live in Busby, East Renfrewshire with their six children.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000awww.kenmacintosh.com (new website)\u000akenmacintoshmsp.co.uk (old website)\u000aKen Macintosh's Scottish Labour Leadership campaign site "scotlandsfuture.co.uk"\u000aScottish Parliament profile

aVPaint Your Wagon is a 1969 Western musical film starring Lee Marvin, Clint Eastwood, and Jean Seberg. The film was adapted by Paddy Chayefsky from the 1951 musical Paint Your Wagon by Lerner and Loewe. It is set in a mining camp in Gold Rush-era California. It was directed by Joshua Logan.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot ==\u000aWhen a wagon crashes into a ravine, prospector Ben Rumson finds two adult male occupants, brothers, one of whom is dead and the other of whom has a broken arm and leg. While burying the dead man, gold dust is discovered at the grave site. Ben stakes a claim on the land and adopts the surviving brother as his "Pardner" while he recuperates.\u000aPardner is innocent and romantic, illustrated by him singing a love song about a girl named Elisa ("I Still See Elisa"), who he later confesses exists only in his imagination. Pardner is a farmer who hopes to make enough in the gold rush to buy some land, and is suspicious of the drunken and seemingly amoral Ben. Ben claims that while he is willing to fight, steal, and cheat at cards, his system of ethics does not allow him to betray a partner. Ben will share the spoils of prospecting on the condition that Pardner takes care of him in his moments of drunkenness and melancholy.\u000aAfter the discovery of gold, "No Name City" springs up as a tent city with the miners alternating between wild parties ("Hand Me Down That Can o' Beans") and bouts of melancholy ("They Call the Wind Maria"). The men become frustrated with the lack of female companionship, so the arrival of a Mormon, Jacob Woodling, with two wives is enough to catch the attention of the entire town. The miners persuade Woodling to sell one of his wives to the highest bidder. Elizabeth, Jacob's younger and more rebellious wife, agrees to be sold based on the reasoning that whatever she gets, it can't be as bad as what she currently has.\u000aA drunken Ben winds up with the highest bid for Elizabeth. Ben is readied for the wedding by the other miners ("Whoop-Ti-Ay"), and is married to Elizabeth under "mining law," with Ben being granted exclusive rights to "all her mineral resources." Elizabeth, not content to be treated as property, threatens to shoot Ben on their wedding night if she is not treated with respect. While she believes Ben is not the type to truly settle down, this is acceptable if he builds a proper wooden cabin to provide her with some security for when he inevitably leaves. Ben, impressed by Elizabeth's determination, enlists the miners to keep this promise, and Elizabeth rejoices in having a proper home ("A Million Miles Away Behind the Door").\u000aSensing the other miners becoming obsessed with her, Ben is consumed by jealousy and paranoia. News comes of the pending arrival of "six French tarts" to a neighboring town and a plan is hatched to kidnap the women and bring them to "No Name City" ("There's a Coach Comin' In"), thus providing the other miners with female companionship. Ben heads up the mission and leaves Elizabeth in the care of Pardner. The two fall in love ("I Talk to the Trees"), whereupon Elizabeth, saying she also still loves Ben, convinces them that "if a Mormon man can have two wives, why can't a woman have two husbands?"\u000aAs the town booms, the arrangement with Ben, Pardner, and Elizabeth works well for a while. But soon the town becomes large enough that civilized people from the East begin to settle there. A parson begins to make a determined effort to persuade the people of No Name City to give up their evil ways, warning the townsfolk that they will be swallowed up by God's wrath if they do not repent ("The Gospel of No Name City"). As the gold plays out, Ben and a group of miners discover that gold dust is dropping through the floor boards of many of the saloons. They tunnel under all the businesses to get the gold ("The Best Things in Life Are Dirty").\u000aMeanwhile, a group of new settlers is rescued from the snow, and the strait-laced family is invited to spend the winter with Elizabeth and Pardner, who is assumed to be her only husband. Ben is left to fend for himself ("Wand'rin' Star"). In revenge, he introduces one of the family, naive young Horton Fenty, to the pleasures of Rotten Luck Willie's saloon and cat house. This leads to Elizabeth dismissing both Ben and Pardner from the log cabin. Pardner takes to gambling in Willie's ("Gold Fever"). During a bull-and-bear fight, the streets collapse into the tunnels dug by Ben and the others and the town is destroyed. A reprise of "The Gospel of No Name City" plays as the town is literally swallowed by the earth.\u000aBen departs for other gold fields, commenting that he never knew Pardner's real name, which Pardner then reveals: Sylvester Newel. Elizabeth and Pardner reconcile and plan to stay.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Cast ==\u000aLee Marvin as Ben Rumson\u000aClint Eastwood as Sylvester Newel/"Pardner"\u000aJean Seberg as Elizabeth\u000aHarve Presnell as Rotten Luck Willie\u000aRay Walston as "Mad Jack" Duncan\u000aTom Ligon as Horton Fenty\u000aAlan Dexter as The Parson\u000aWilliam O'Connell as Horace Tabor\u000aBen Baker as Haywood Holbrook\u000aAlan Baxter as Mr. Fenty\u000aPaula Trueman as Mrs. Fenty\u000aRobert Easton as Atwell\u000aGeoffrey Norman as Foster\u000aH.B.

In the film "Rumson City" is simply called "No Name City," and Ben Rumson has no daughter. In the stage show, "Elisa" is Ben's departed wife, but in the film, she is Pardner's fantasy. The character "Julio" is replaced by "Pardner", now an American and Ben's partner in the gold claim. Additionally, in the film it is Pardner who falls in love with Elizabeth, Ben's wife under mining law, rather than the stage musical character Edgar Crocker. The temporary solution to the love triangle among Ben, Pardner and Elizabeth appears only in the film as well. In the stage version, Ben Rumson dies at the end; in the film he survives.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Production ==\u000aLee Marvin accepted the lead role instead of appearing in The Wild Bunch. He received $1 million while Eastwood was paid $750,000. Faye Dunaway turned down the role of Elizabeth before Seberg was cast. Diana Rigg and Julie Andrews were also considered for the role. Eastwood and Marvin did their own singing while Seberg's songs were dubbed. The early incarnation of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band had a cameo in the song "Hand Me Down That Can o' Beans". Some songs from the original musical were dropped and some were added by Alan Jay Lerner and André Previn, while others were used in different contexts.\u000aPaint Your Wagon was shot near Baker City, Oregon with filming beginning in May 1968 and ending in October. Other locations include Big Bear Lake, California and San Bernardino National Forest; the interiors were filmed at Paramount Studios with Joshua Logan directing. The film's initial budget was $10 million, before it eventually doubled to $20 million. A daily expense of $80,000 was incurred to transport cast and crew to the filming location, as the closest hotel was nearly 60 miles away. The elaborate camp used in the film cost $2.4 million to build.\u000aThe film was released at a time when movie musicals were going out of fashion, especially with younger audiences. Its overblown budget and nearly 3-hour length became notorious in the press. Eastwood was frustrated by the long delays in the making of the film, later saying that the experience strengthened his resolve to become a director. According to Robert Osborne, Marvin drank heavily during the filming, which may have enhanced his screen appearance, but led to delays and many retakes.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Release ==\u000aPaint Your Wagon was released in United States theaters in October 1969. The film became Paramount's sixth largest success up to that point (and the sixth highest-grossing film of 1969) when it earned $31.6 million over its release, although the earnings never offset the cost of production and marketing.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reception ==\u000aCritical reception was mostly negative. Paint Your Wagon currently maintains a 27% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\u000aIn the UK, Paint Your Wagon had a 79-week 70mm roadshow run at The Astoria Theatre, London and Marvin's deep-voiced rendition of "Wand'rin' Star," accompanied by the film's choir, became a number one hit. His voice was described by Jean Seberg as "like rain gurgling down a rusty pipe". Interviewed on NPR, Marvin said that the song was a hit in Australia, and someone there described it as, "The first 33\u2153 recorded at 45."\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aNotes\u000a\u000aBibliography\u000aHughes, Howard (2009).

aVSpycat: An Interactive Exposé of M.I.4\u200b1\u20442 is an arcade adventure video game for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron, written by Peter Scott (under the pseudonym Dylan) and published by Superior Software in 1988. The game is a parody of the scandal surrounding the Spycatcher book.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Gameplay ==\u000a\u000aSpycat is loosely based on the then current scandal surrounding the release of Spycatcher, the memoirs of former MI5 officer and Assistant Director Peter Wright. The player takes the role of the Spycat, Peter Correct, who has worked for M.I.4\u200b1\u20442 for fifty years but finds out he is to be forced to retire with a low pension. The player must collect classified research documents (among other items), then flee to Greenland to write his memoirs. Other characters found in the game include Sir Clive Amstrad (an amalgamation of Clive Sinclair and Alan Sugar) as technical expert "Q" and the Prime Minister Margo Thatch (Margaret Thatcher).\u000aThe game takes the form of an arcade adventure with the player moving through a series of locations and rooms, collecting and using items to progress. The player must avoid CCTV cameras and "Q"'s electronic devices that will drain Spycat's energy. The actions in the game (e.g. picking up and using items, opening doors) are controlled using an icon panel at the top of the screen.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Development and release ==\u000aAuthor Peter Scott completed the game while still under exclusive contract to Audiogenic. Unhappy with their promotion of his games, he offered Spycat to Superior Software who wanted to publish it. Scott gave twelve months notice to get out of the deal with Audiogenic so Spycat (and other games he released in 1988) was credited only to the pseudonym Dylan. It became the first of ten full price games Scott created for Superior between 1988 and 1990.\u000aThe game was released in 1988 by Superior Software on cassette for the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro as well as 5.25" floppy disk for the BBC Micro and 3.5" disk for the Master Compact. It was included on the Play It Again Sam 9 compilation in 1989 and was reissued as part of the Superior/Blue Ribbon budget range in 1990.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Critical reception ==\u000aElectron User gave the game an overall score of 7/10 with reviewer Chris Nixon finding the icon control panel "tiresome" and "unwieldy" but this is his "only complaint in an otherwise excellent game". He concludes "Spycat is an excellent arcade adventure with a strong vein of humour underlying all the action".\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Orsini Bomb was a terrorist improvised explosive device built by Felice Orsini and used as a hand grenade in 1858 in an attempt to murder Emperor Napoleon III. The weapons were somewhat commonly used by anarchists in the latter half of the 19th century in Europe, and surplus bombs were also used by the Confederacy during the American Civil War. The design is reminiscent of modern impact fused grenades, such as the Soviet RGO hand grenades.\u000aThe bomb had a unique design for its time, and instead of having a fuse or timer, the bomb had numerous pins around it. The pins were filled with mercury fulminate and when the pins sensed contact on any angle with an object, it would immediately trigger the detonation. The bomb was designed by Felice Orsini, an Italian exile living in England, while the casing of the bomb was made by English gunmaker Joseph Taylor. The bomb was designed and created in Birmingham, England but was tested by Taylor in Sheffield and Devon. After thorough testing, Taylor provided the bomb to Orsini and smuggled them into France disguised as \u201cgas machinery.\u201d Taylor later claimed that he thought the device was a genuine piece of explosive ordnance of a novel design. The bomb was originally created in an attempt to kill Napoleon III in 1858. This act and the design of the bombs may have been inspired by a previous attempt to kill Napoleon I in 1800 with an improvised explosive. Orsini created 12 bombs for the plot. The plan was that he and three other accomplices would throw four bombs at the Emperor when he emerged from his carriage, but they all missed their targets. However, they did still manage to kill 10 and wound 157, including Orsini himself. A description of the plot written by a participant was found and said: \u201cMy grenade contained 4 pounds of powder. All the conspirators had their respective posts previously assigned to them. Four hand-grenades were to be thrown by Gomez, myself, Orsini, and Pieri, respectively. \u2026 throwing my grenade right under the fore part of the carriage, and dropping myself among some dead horses and struggling men, I watched the effects of the explosion. The horses and the driver were instantly killed[.]\u201d\u000aThe Orsini bomb was later used by anarchists in several plots, including an attack at Barcelona's Liceu Theater in 1893 by Santiago Salvador; killing 22 and wounding 30. Though only one of the bombs detonated. One of the unexploded bombs was preserved at the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA) until it was displayed at the Van Gogh Museum in 2007 in an exhibit on late 19th century Barcelona. Coincidently, the bombs were thrown into the audience during the play \u201cWilliam Tell\u201d which is the same play that the Emperor Napoleon III and his wife were on their way to during the attempt on their life by Orsini over 35 years earlier. An Orsini bomb was also once dug up in Arkansas in the 1950s. It is said to have been used during the Civil War by the Confederacy. Many types of improvised grenades were used in the Civil War and the Orsini bomb was well known to be copied or acquired from French surplus designs.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sources ==\u000aDavies, Roger. \u201cHome - The Felix Orsini Bomb.\u201d Standing Well Back, IED and Eod Evolutions, 30 Dec. 2012, www.standingwellback.com/home/2012/12/30/the-felix-orsini-bomb.html.

aVThomas Sergeant Hall (23 December 1858 \u2013 21 December 1915) was an Australian geologist and biologist, recipient of The Murchison Fund in 1901.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aHall was born in Geelong, the son of Thomas March Hall, a business man in that town but originally from Lincolnshire, England and Elizabeth, née Walshe, from Dublin. Hall was educated at the Geelong Grammar School where he came under the influence of James L. Cuthbertson. He was a junior master at Wesley College in 1879-80, then Hawthorn College and then went to the University of Melbourne, where he took his B.A. degree in 1886 with honours in natural science. This included work in palaeontology under Sir Frederick McCoy. Hall taught for a year at Girton College, Sandhurst (now Bendigo) in 1887, but returned to the university and did a three years' course in biology under Professor Sir Baldwin Spencer.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aHall took a leading part in the forming of the university science club, and through it met Dr G. B. Pritchard with whom he was later to do valuable work in geology. Hall was a successful director of the Castlemaine school of mines from 1890 to 1893, and in the latter year became lecturer in biology at Melbourne university. Hall held this position until his death but found time for many other activities.\u000aIn 1899 Hall published a Catalogue of the Scientific and Technical Periodical Literature in the Libraries of Victoria. A second and enlarged edition, in which he was assisted by Mr E. R. Pitt of the public library, Melbourne, appeared in 1911. He did much valuable work for the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria (president 1901\u20131903), the Royal Society of Victoria, and the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science. His Victorian Hill and Dale (1909), describing the geology of the country around Melbourne, is a model book of popular science, written without a trace of scientific jargon; there is barely a technical term in its 150 pages. He did not write a large number of papers, but his work on the graptolite rocks of Victoria led to his being made the recipient of The Murchison Fund of the Geological Society of London in 1901. One of his major discoveries was the key to the unravelling of the complex Ordovician sequence.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Legacy ==\u000aHall became ill early in 1915, but courageously carried on his work until shortly before his death from chronic nephritis on 21 December 1915. He married Miss Eva Lucie Annie Hill on 21 December 1891, who survived him along with three sons and a daughter. He was given the honorary degree of D.Sc. by Melbourne university in 1908. Dr Hall was a good example of the hard-working man of science, giving much time to matters of routine, and yet contriving to do original and important work in one or more directions. Hall's work with Dr Pritchard on the tertiary fossiliferous strata of Victoria, and his own work on the graptolite rocks of Victoria gives him a permanent place in the history of Australian geology.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aSerle, Percival (1949).

aVLaguna Creek (Spanish for: Lake Creek) is a perennial stream that flows northwesterly for 2.6-mile (4.2 km) along the San Andreas Fault from Woodside in San Mateo County, California and, after crossing the Phleger Estate and Filoli, enters Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir, where it is a historic tributary to San Mateo Creek. San Mateo Creek then carries its waters over Crystal Springs Dam northeast to San Francisco Bay.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aAfter discovering San Francisco Bay from Sweeney Ridge on November 4, 1769, the Portolà expedition descended on what Portolà called the Cañada de San Francisco, now known as San Andreas Creek, to its confluence with San Mateo Creek. Just downstream from here was Laguna Creek's confluence with San Mateo Creek. Crossing San Mateo Creek just above its canyon, Portola's party proceeded south along Laguna Creek and camped on a lake which Portolà called Laguna Grande, now covered by Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir. The campsite is marked by California Historical Marker No. 94, "Portola Expedition Camp", located at Crystal Springs Dam, on Skyline Boulevard, 0.1 mi south of Crystal Springs Road. Then Portola continued south and descended from the foothills along San Francisquito Creek to established his base camp at El Palo Alto, in modern-day Palo Alto, California. The Laguna Creek and Laguna Grande place names are shown on the 1856 plat maps/diseños of Rancho de las Pulgas and Rancho Cañada de Raymundo and Easton's 1868 map of San Mateo County.\u000aRaimundo, a native of Baja California, was sent out by the padres of Mission Santa Clara to capture runaway Mission Indians in 1797. On August 4, 1840, he was granted the Rancho Cañada de Raymundo and on the 1856 Rancho Pulgas and 1868 Easton maps, the valley of Laguna Creek was referred to as the Cañada de Raymundo and Laguna Grande became alternatively known as Lake Raymundo. Laguna Creek was also alternatively known as Cañada Raimundo Creek.\u000aThe two Crystal Springs lakes and San Andreas Lake used to be known as Spring Valley Lakes for the Spring Valley Water Company which owned them. The Spring Valley Water Company named the lakes, the Spring Valley Lakes, after the company. The original Spring Valley was between Mason and Taylor Streets, and Washington and Broadway Streets in San Francisco, where the water company started. When the company went south for more water, the Spring Valley name was carried south too. Laguna Grande was submerged when the Spring Valley Water Company built an earthen dam in 1877 (this was the first Crystal Springs Dam), forming Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir. The old earthen dam became a causeway between Upper and Lower Crystal Springs Reservoirs when the latter was formed by Herman Schussler's concrete Crystal Springs Dam, which dammed up San Mateo Creek to form the lower reservoir in 1888. The causeway is now crossed by Highway 92.\u000aFiloli, the estate of Spring Valley Water Company tycoon William Bourn, is now an historic site. The staff there currently refers to Laguna Creek as "Orchard Creek", and its tributaries on the historic estate as Fault Creek and Spring Creek.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Watershed ==\u000a\u000aThe official source of the Laguna Creek mainstem is in Edgewood County Park on the Serpentine Trail, along which it gently descends westerly until being forced into a culvert near the Interstate-280 underpass for the Edgewood Trail. It emerges on the west side of I-280 and continues west until it crosses Edgewood Road just north of Cañada Road. It is confined in a small reservoir northeast of Cañada Road, then passes beneath into another small reservoir west of Cañada Road, after which it joins the south fork of Laguna Creek. The south fork of Laguna Creek originates near the Sunset (Sunset Way) Trailhead, and descends in a small canyon along the Clarkia Trail until it reaches an earthen berm protecting the PG&E substation. After two right angle turns around the substation it passes into a culvert under I-280, emerging southwest of the I-280 overpass over Cañada Road. From here the south fork flows northwest along the west side of Cañada Road, passing Homestead Pond, then after crossing Phleger and Old Cañada Roads, it is joined by West Fork Laguna Creek (a short creek that flows down along Old Cañada Road). After that the south fork joins the Laguna Creek mainstem northwest of the intersection of Edgewood Road and Cañada Road. From here Laguna Creek is joined on the left (heading downstream) on the Filoli property by locally named Fault Creek, then Spring Creek, then on the right by the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct and Pulgas Water Temple just before entering Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir.\u000aLaguna Creek used to be 1.8 miles longer, or 4.4-mile-long (7.1 km) total, before its confluence with San Mateo Creek was submerged by the Lower Crystal Springs Reservoir in 1888. Adobe Gulch is the northernmost of several tributaries (and the only one named by the USGS) that descend the eastern flank of the Santa Cruz Mountains to Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir (and historically, Laguna Creek).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Ecology ==\u000a\u000aSan Mateo County historian Frank Stanger cited sizeable groves of redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) in the Laguna Creek watershed. In the area around Filoli he described two historic lumber mills. The historic "Smith Mill" on Fault Creek was destroyed by fire in 1854. Pinckney's mill in "the largest gulch", which would be Spring Creek, was built in 1855 and later purchased by S. L. Mastic. Although information on these mills is limited, they support the idea that "the area was thoroughly logged". A large redwood tree remains on Laguna Creek between the lower Filoli parking lot and main entrance gate.\u000aFog drip may play a key role in the precipitation in the upper watershed. On Cahill Ridge (just west of San Mateo Creek and east of Pilarcitos Creek, at an altitude of 1,000 feet, Oberlander measured fog drip beneath tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), coast redwood and three Douglas fir trees, the latter 125 feet tall. He found that the trees most exposed produced the most precipitation and in five weeks of measurement (July 20-August 28, 1951) fog drip below the tanoak produced 59 inches of precipitation, more than the total annual precipitation on nearby grasslands and chaparral. The Douglas fir produced 7-17 inches of fog drip and appeared to provide unique conditions supporting the orchids giant helleborine (Epipactis gigantea) and phantom orchid (Cephalanthera austiniae), since these plants were found exclusively in these moist ridge tops.\u000aBoth the Laguna Creek mainstem and south fork Laguna Creek originate northeast of I-280 in the Edgewood County Park and Nature Preserve, where the Friends of Edgewood Natural Preserve work to preserve the unique serpentine native grasslands, habitat which is critical to the threatened Bay checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha bayensis).\u000aAlong the Crystal Springs Trail, just southwest of Cañada Road and its I-280 overpass, is the Homestead Pond. This 12 acre pond and marsh is host to Western pond turtles (Actinemys marmorata) and is adjacent to the south fork of Laguna Creek. The pond is the site of a restoration effort by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission which will include removal of non-native eucalyptus trees and planting of native oaks and grasses.\u000aAlthough Laguna Creek generally runs dry in summer, on October 17, 2012, two-year-old rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were observed in cold, spring-fed perennial pools along the Filoli property. This finding is notable considering that it was the very end of the dry season in a low rainfall year [63% of normal (182 mm of normal 492 mm in San Francisco)].\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of watercourses in the San Francisco Bay Area\u000aFiloli\u000aSan Mateo Creek\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aFriends of Edgewood County Park and Natural Preserve\u000aPhleger Estate/Golden Gate National Recreation Area web page\u000aFiloli Historic Estate web page

aVSync sound (synchronized sound recording) refers to sound recorded at the time of the filming of movies. It has been widely used in movies since the birth of sound movies. \u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aEven in the silent film era, films were shown with sounds, often with musical accompaniment by a pianist or an orchestra keeping time with the screen action. The first synchronization was a turning recording device marked with a white spot. As the white spot rotated, the cameraman hand cranked the camera to keep it in sync with the recording. The method was then repeated for playback, but with the projectionist hand cranking the film projector. "Single-system" sound recorded sound optically to part of the original camera film, or magnetically to a stripe of magnetic coating along the film edge.\u000a"Double-system" sound used independent cameras and sound recorders. The first sync sound standard used recorders and cameras both powered by AC (alternating current) motors - essentially clock motors.\u000aLater the 50 Hz or 60 Hz sine wave, called a Pilottone, was recorded on a second parallel track of an audio recorder.\u000aIn double-system film, speed variations of camera and recorder, as well as the elasticity of the magnetic recording tape, requires some positive means of keying the dialogue to its appropriate film frame. The inclusion on the sound recorder of a second, parallel, sync or "Pilotone" track, has been the most common method in use until today. In video recording, synchronism is electronically generated and generally called dual-system sound \u000aIf location, a camera is driven by a DC motor, with some sort of governor control to hold it fairly accurate at 24 fps, a sync pulse generator geared to the movement or motor shaft could be employed to provide the sync pulse output. A cable conducts the sync pulse from camera to sound recorder. The sync pulse is typically a sine wave of 50 or 60 Hz with an RMS amplitude of approximately 1 volt.\u000aThis double-system audio recording could then be transferred or "resolved" to sprocketed magnetic film, with sprocket holes that match one to one with the original camera film. These two sprocketed media could be run through a "Moviola" or flat-bed editing table such as the Steenbeck for synchronous sound editing. \u000aWith the introduction of the Bulova "Accutron" watch that used a tuning fork as a time reference (watches later used an oscillating electronic crystal), the camera no longer needed to be connected to the sound recorder with a cable. The camera speed was controlled by one oscillator, and a second oscillator in the recorder generated the Pilotone.\u000aThis method was developed in the 1960s by pioneering filmmaker Richard Leacock. It was called Direct Cinema. Filmmakers abandoned the studio and went out on location to film, often with hand-held cameras. \u000aIn 1972, Bell & Howell brought out a consumer version of a double-system Super-8 sound filmmaking system called "Filmosound". A compact cassette recorder was attached to the camera with a cable that transmitted a single pulse to the recorder every time a new frame of film was exposed in the camera. On playback, the cassette recorder pulse was used to control the projector speed.\u000aAt that time, Ricky Leacock, a professor in the MIT architecture department film section, developed a Super-8 film production system with a crystal-controlled camera, a crystal-generated Pilotone cassette recorder, a sprocketed magnetic film recorder, a flatbed editing table, and a projector. The MIT/Leacock System was funded with a $300,000 grant from the founder of Polaroid, Edwin Land.\u000aIn 1973, the one-pulse-per-frame technique was used to control recording directly onto sprocketed magnetic film in the Super8 Sound Recorder. The Super8 Sound Recorder could also "resolve" sound that had been recorded onto cassette tape with this new "digital" sync pulse.\u000aToday, digital video cameras and digital sound recorders synchronize electronically, being used for double-system video production.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Pioneering films ==\u000aOn the Bowery by Lionel Rogosin (1956)\u000aChronicle of a Summer by Jean Rouch (1958)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Sync sound in Asia ==\u000aIn Hong Kong, sync sound was not widely used until the 1990s, as the generally noisy environment and lower production budgets made such a method impractical.\u000aMost Bollywood films from the 1960s onwards do not employ this technique and for that very reason the 2001 films Lagaan and Dil Chahta Hai were noted for the use of sync sound. The common practice in Bollywood is to 'dub' over the dialogues at the post-production stage. Currently, Indian sound designers and sound mixers like Resul Pookutty, Nakul Kamte, Dileep Subrahmaniam, Debashish Mishra, Indrajit Neogi, Arun Nambiar, Baylon Fonseca, Manas Choudhary and many others among the fresh talent are endeavoring to change this.\u000aThe first Indian talkie, Alam Ara (1931), made the first use of sync sound in India and subsequent Indian films were regularly shot in sync sound with the silent Mitchell camera, until the 1960s. With the arrival of the Arri 2C, a noisy but more practical camera particularly for outdoor shoots, 'dubbing' became the norm and was never reversed.\u000aUse of this technique has increased in recent times with the development in film techniques and instrumentation like Arri Blimp cameras. This system has been used in the Hindi movie Jodhaa Akbar.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe Holocaust Kid is a semi-autobiographical novel by Sonia Pilcer.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Plot summary ==\u000aThe book has fifteen stories that is loosely based on the life of author Sonia Pilcer. Zosha Palovsky, who prefers to call herself Zoe, was born in Europe in a camp for DPs. She moved to New York City with her parents, Genia and Heniek, when she was a toddler. Zoe reconciles her dreams with her parents' experiences. The first story called Do You Deserve To Lie is narrated by Zoe who works for a movie magazine and does things that her parents doesn't appreciate. Two stories tell about how Genia was saved from the gas chambers and how she met Heniek after the war. In another story, it talks about how Heniek escaped from Auschwitz. Other stories have to do with Zoe appreciating her parents more, marrying, and going on vacation with her parents.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reception ==\u000aIt was reviewed by Kirkus Reviews.\u000aIt was reviewed by Publishers Weekly.\u000aIt was reviewed by Booklist.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVThe One chip MSX, or 1chipMSX as the D4 Enterprise distributional name for the ESE MSX System 3, is a re-implementation of an MSX-2 home computer that uses a single FPGA to implement all the electronics (except the RAM) of an MSX-2, including the MSX-MUSIC and SCC+ audio extensions.\u000aThe system is housed in a transparent blue plastic box, and can be used with a standard monitor (or TV) and a PC keyboard. Original MSX cartridges can be inserted, as well as SD and MMC memory cards as an external storage medium. Even though it lacks a 3.5" disk drive, disks are supported through emulation on a memory card, including support for booting MSX-DOS. Due to its VHDL programmable hardware, it's possible to give the device new hardware extensions by simply running a reconfiguration program under MSX-DOS. The "one chip-MSX" is equipped with two USB connectors, that can be used after adding some supporting VHDL code.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Availability ==\u000aThe ESE MSX System 3 is designed by ESE Artists' Factory and distributed as 1chipMSX by D4 Enterprise and was supposed to be distributed outside Japan by Bazix. However, due to RoHS regulations in Europe, it was claimed it could not be distributed to Europe in its original form and the European market had to wait for an adapted version which would be produced through Bazix and distributed to Europe by Bazix. However, no violation of RoHS has ever been proven, with all identifiable components of the PCB and power supply being RoHS-compliant. Bazix stopped being the representative of MSX Association and thus did not bring the 1chipMSX to the Western market. In the end, MSX Association was dissolved due to a dispute with other parties involved, resulting in a shift of all intellectual property rights concerning MSX to MSX Licensing Corporation. Bazix also dissolved because this dispute made an end to their efforts and ambitions to bring the 1chipMSX to the Western market (along with other projects that were also dependent on the Japanese partners).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Hardware specifications ==\u000aAltera Cyclone EP1C12Q240C8N FPGA chip\u000a32 MB SDRAM\u000aSD/MMC card slot\u000a2 MSX Cartridge slots\u000a2 audio outputs (for future stereo support)\u000aS-Video video output\u000aComposite video output\u000aVGA video output\u000aPS/2 keyboard connector\u000a2 USB connector\u000a2 MSX Joystick ports\u000aFPGA I/O pin (40 pins and 10 pins)\u000aIncluded are also:\u000aA Short English instruction manual, including a short introduction to VHDL\u000aFull VHDL code used to achieve MSX2 compatibility (default configuration)\u000aA CD-ROM with VHDL code examples and the following software:\u000aAltera Quartus 2 Web Edition - VHDL development environment\u000aPLDLOAD and PLDSAVE - Software to read and program the FPGA chip\u000aEP, FDLOAD and FDSAVE - Software to create, load and play disk images\u000a\u000a220 V adapter or 110 V converter plug\u000aSchematics to the One Chip MSX PCB\u000aBlueprint of the One Chip MSX casing\u000a\u000a\u000a== Specifications ==\u000aDefault specifications of the implemented MSX system:\u000aMSX 2 computer system\u000a1 MB RAM\u000a128 kB VRAM\u000aKanji-ROM\u000aMSX-MUSIC\u000aMSX-DOS2 with FAT16 support\u000aMEGA-SCSI compatible support for SD card as primary drive\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of MSX compatible computers\u000aMinimig is a similar FPGA project emulating a different home computer.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a1chipMSX wiki (in Japanese)\u000aESE MSX System 3 information \u2014 English technical overview with tutorials and tools.\u000aKdL Index! \u2014 Unofficial firmware updates.\u000aMSX Resource Center
